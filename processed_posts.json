Based on Jim Shepard’s short story of the same name, Mona Fastvold’s desperately romantic film starts where Abigail’s diary also begins: with a new year, and new neighbors. Through lyrical voice-over and closely drawn scenes, Abigail tells of how, in the wake of unimaginable loss, her life is cracked wide open by the arrival of effervescent, free-spirited Tallie. She speaks of grief and exhaustion, but also of astonishment and joy.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><!-- more --></p><p>It’s a story felt through whispers as much as kisses, framed by the blustery winds of the East-Coast frontier—and by the spectre of their husbands (Casey Affleck as the downcast Dyer, Christopher Abbott as the jealous, disturbing Finney) finding out about their new love. Fastvold gives each character just enough attention to let the relationships that matter most rise up all on their own. She does so with words, poetry that somehow feels alive, and with music—specifically, a stunningly passionate clarinet soundtrack.</p><p><i>The World to Come</i> won the Queer Lion at Venice last August (where it miraculously had an in-person premiere), and won many more hearts at Sundance in January. It’s Fastvold’s second film as director, after 2014’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7bQ6\"><i>The Sleepwalker</i></a>, which also starred Christopher Abbott, and was co-written by Fastvold’s partner (and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/fcFk\">Vox Lux</a></i> director) Brady Corbet.</p><p><b>What did you feel when reading Jim’s story for the first time?<br/></b><i>Mona Fastvold</i>: It was a home I wanted to move into. It was this feeling of thinking, ‘This belongs in my universe, and I belong in this universe.’ And I all of a sudden had a few images that I felt a very strong need to create. The first thing that I felt really compelled to do was creating this physical expression of joy after the first kiss. I had this image of Katherine in this wide shot, completely open and just exposed. And I was really compelled to shoot her in the snow by the grave as well.</p><p>I also wanted to frame her being tied to the house with a rope, working her way through the snowstorm. There was a lot of amazing text and maybe fewer images in the script, because it’s written by these two really wonderful writers and authors of novels, not so much screenplays. So it’s not a very technical screenplay, and there were a lot of things left to me to work out, which I enjoyed. But the foundation was this really good text.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>The text is so striking, in the way it’s so verbose but never feels stiff. How did you keep the words intact while bringing these emotions to life?<br/></b>I cast some really good actors, so that helps! Then when you’re working with this kind of text, it’s not really a text that you can improvise or play around as much, you really just need to honor it. For me it’s really about finding the movement that will support the beats of the text. I like the edit to be motivated by a gesture, something that says, “I want you to look at this”. I’m trying to make the rhythm more exciting. Ping-ponging back and forth is less exciting to me.</p><p>When rehearsing, we’d create movement either physically, or find changes through long pauses already in the text, and then upon finding those organic beats I’d figure out with my DP how we can stay in one take for as long as possible, until we find that moment which motivates a change. I never like there to be a camera movement just for there to be something cool visually. And there’s all this subtext in the text, all these messages Abigail and Tallie are trying to send to each other. When are you being direct? When are you being understood? When are you not?</p><p><b>Particularly in recent years, we’ve been fortunate to have a number of films that reframe period pieces about forbidden lesbian romances. Why do you think we keep coming back to this kind of story?<br/></b>A lot of people feel compelled to say these stories have always been there, and to claim that part of history. It’s not modern, it’s not a new thing, but it’s just that these stories have not been told much. Especially a love story that takes place among farmers. We know a little bit about upper-class stories from some literature, but not that much from that time period. So part of the appeal for me was to say: this is a part of history. Even though it’s not a story about Napoleon, this story about these two quiet, introverted women is still worth exploring. And we’ve seen a lot of movies during this time period in America about what the husbands were out doing. I’ve grown up watching these movies, but they had wives who are at home, living their completely separate lives. What were they up to?</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>You mention the husbands—I felt watching this film that it was set in a very different world to the likes of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jkPq\"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a>, which a lot of people loved precisely because of how few men were in the film. But here the husbands play a really important part within the story about these two women, helping to convey their frustration and limitations, without taking over.<br/></b>All characters in a story deserve equal counts of love and attention from the writers, directors and actors. It was incredibly important to portray the men with as much nuance as Abigail and Tallie. It makes for a more interesting story for them, that their relationships with their partners are complex—they’re not just these male archetypes who are terrible and awful. Dyer was an interesting character, in that he’s striving to understand even though he doesn’t quite. And he had different ambitions as well, but this is the situation he’s in, and he’s chosen a practical partner who he respects, and I guess loves and cares for. But they’re running a farm together, they’re business partners as well and depend on each other for survival. When he says “I’ll die without you” it’s quite literal, in a way. I wanted to break these characters open and make them more difficult to deal with, for themselves and for the women as well.</p><p><b>Your picture includes a beautiful, and really unexpected score by Daniel Blumberg—particularly in the use of the clarinet, which feels like its own kind of narrative. Can you talk me through the process of weaving that into the story?<br/></b>I brought in Daniel even when I was developing the script and working on casting early on. I kept listening to ‘Three Pieces for Solo Clarinet’ by Igor Stravinsky, and somehow the instrument felt really connected to Katherine’s voice-over. It was important that the voice-over was not slammed on top at the end. It’s there, I hope, to have a bit of an ASMR effect where you feel it draws you really close to Abigail in a hypnotic way. That you feel like you get this intimate experience of that character by having access to her life even if it doesn’t explain things too much.</p><p>So we wanted to have the score speaking to the voice-over, which we recorded long before we started shooting as well. We would play it on set and Daniel would come in and play music there. So constantly being in dialogue between the text being read and the music being played was an important part of the process.</p><p><b>It’s time for some Life in Film questions. What is your favorite ‘forbidden love’ story?<br/></b>A film I really love, which inspired <i>The World to Come,</i> is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7COG\"><i>Olivia</i></a>. It’s from 1951 and it’s directed by Jacqueline Audry, and it was one of the first lesbian on-screen kisses ever captured. It’s a great movie directed by a female director when that wasn’t so much of a thing. It was an important trailblazer for this film.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>What’s your favourite “Dear Diary” movie, the one that best uses a confessional voice-over?<br/></b>Terrence Malick pretty much cornered that market with some beautiful, beautiful attempts at that. We definitely have to pay our respects! Particularly <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JRg\"><i>Days of Heaven</i></a> is pretty amazing. The voice-over work there is extraordinary.</p><p><b>What is your go-to comfort movie?<br/></b>It’s funny because I was asked that a while ago and normally I would just be like, “Anything <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nancy-meyers/\">Nancy Meyers</a> makes is just so lovely”. She makes these films that are just like candy. But during the pandemic, it’s just too hard to watch these cozy movies, because it just makes you feel depressed. So right now, the film I’ve watched the most in my lifetime is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2axs\"><i>Eyes Wide Shut</i></a>. I also find it to be a Christmas movie… If it’s on anywhere, I’ll always leave it on, or just watch a little piece of it.</p><p><b>What should Letterboxd members watch after <i>The World to Come</i>?<br/></b>First of all they should watch <i>Olivia</i> if they haven’t seen it, and then the other day I watched <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lqNO\"><i>Martin Eden</i></a>—it’s an incredible movie. So beautifully made.</p><p><b>What is the one film that first made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b>I grew up watching a lot of movies. My family are cinephiles and I’ve always loved films. I grew up on a steady diet of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ingmar-bergman/\">Ingmar Bergman</a>’s films during my teenage years, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/andrei-tarkovsky/\">Tarkovsky</a> too. Seeing those films made a really big impression me. But what really inspired me in many ways was seeing <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/claire-denis/\">Claire Denis</a>’ films. The way she approaches storytelling is so intuitive. It’s so exciting. That resonated with me, and later on I recognized some of that in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/lucrecia-martel-1/\">Lucrecia Martel</a> as well. I just love how she handles time and logic and character.</p>"

Despite its cultural specificity—a Korean family shifting to the Ozarks in the 1980s—the film has transcended barriers and stolen hearts. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/run-2020/\"><i>Run</i></a> director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aneeshchaganty/film/minari/\">Aneesh Chaganty says</a>, “I saw my dad. I saw my mom. I saw my grandma. I saw my brother. I saw me.” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ianamurray/film/minari/\">Iana writes</a>, “Its portrayal of assimilation rang so true and for that, I feel personally attacked.” The versatile herb of the title, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kevinyang/film/minari/\">Kevin observes</a>, is “a marker of home, of South Korea, but it can grow and propagate as long as there is water.”</p><p>Though a large portion of <i>Minari</i> was vividly drawn from Chung’s childhood, a few of the film’s most quietly memorable moments were contributions from its Korean-born cast.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><!-- more --></p><p>Veteran actress <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/youn-yuh-jung/\">Youn Yuh-jung</a>, who’s extraordinary as the visiting, wily grandmother Soonja, traces the origins of the scene where she cracks open a chestnut in her mouth and hands it to seven-year-old grandson David (Alan Kim), to her time living in America. “I’ve seen one grandmother visiting at the time—we don’t have chestnuts in Florida—she brought them all the way from Korea. Actually it was worse than the scene. My friend’s mother brought [the] chestnut. She chewed it and spit it out into a spoon and shared it with her grandson. Her husband was an Irishman. He was almost shocked. We didn’t do that, but I shared that kind of thing with Isaac.”</p><p>Most viewers watching this scene will likely recoil in horror, as David does, but co-star <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/han-ye-ri/\">Han Ye-ri</a>, playing Soonja’s daughter Monica, notes the practicality of the gesture: “If you give a big chunk to children they could choke on that, so it’s natural for them to do that for their children.”</p><p>In another brief, beautifully serene scene—one that is so rarely depicted in American cinema that it’s almost stunning—Monica is seen gently cleaning David’s ears. Han came up with the idea. “Originally it was cutting the nails for David,” she says. “Cleaning your wife and husband’s ears is such a common thing in Korea. Initially the producer or somebody from the production opposed the idea because they regarded it as dangerous, but because it is something that is so common in our daily lives I thought we should go with the idea.”</p><p>Neither actress comes from a traditional movie-oriented background. With no acting ambitions, Youn began her fifty-year career with a part-time job hunt that led her to distributing gifts to an audience at a TV station. “It was freshman year from college and they gave me pretty good money. So I thought, ‘Wow, that’s good!’.”</p><p>“I’m kind of ashamed about that, as nowadays all the kids plan their future,” she says. “When I talk to the younger generation, they start having dreams about being an actor in the sixth grade. In the sixth grade, I was just playing—nothing. I didn’t plan anything. [Laughs.]”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Before acting, Ye-ri trained as a professional dancer, and while she wasn’t specifically inspired by movies to cross over into acting, she was an avid film watcher in her formative years. “Working as an actress made me realize how many films I’ve seen growing up.”</p><p>“My first memory of a non-Korean-language film left such a strong impression on me, especially the ending,” she says. “The film is called <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29jk\"><i>Doctor Zhivago</i></a>. I saw it on TV and not in theaters. The first film I saw in theaters was <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1XhG\"><i>Beauty and the Beast</i></a>. But even growing up I remember because Koreans love films so much they would have films on TV all the time. I watched a lot of TV growing up because both my parents were busy, and in retrospect that really helped become the basis of my career. [Laughs.]”</p><p>She also grew up “taking reference from Miss Youn’s body of work to study from, as did many other actresses”. Grateful for the opportunity to work with her on <i>Minari</i>, Ye-ri says, “On set working with her, it made me realize how wonderful it is that this person still carries her own distinct color and scent. And seeing her taking part in this production in a foreign country—she’s over 70—it just really encouraged me that I should be more fearless like her.” She adds: “One of the things that I really want to learn from her is her sense of humor but I think I’m going to have that for my next life. [Laughs.]”</p><p>As for Youn’s adventures in early movie-going, she recalls the first Korean film she saw with her father was the 1956 historical drama <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tV3S\">Ma-ui taeja</a></i>, based on a popular Korean fairy tale. “I was so scared. I cried so my father had to take me out of the theater.”</p><p>“At [the] time, we always had to watch the news on the screen before the movie. It started with a national anthem and every audience from the theater would need to stand up and pledge to the Korean flag. It’s a very stupid thing for you guys but it was like that 60 years ago.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>For <i>Minari</i> fans who want to discover more of Youn’s work, she recommends starting with the first movie she made with the late, great director Kim Ki-young, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fire-woman/\"><i>Woman of Fire</i></a>—a remake of his own 1962 Korean classic <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-housemaid/\"><i>The Housemaid</i></a>. “A long time ago I couldn’t see it. Of course I first saw it when it was shown at the theater back when I was twenty. But later on we had a retrospective, so I saw that movie 50 years later. Wow, he was very genius. I was very impressed. That time we had censorship and everything but with that crisis he made that film. That was a memorable movie to [me].”</p><p>Youn admits finding it difficult to be emotionally invested watching a film starring herself, including <i>Minari</i>. “It’s terrible, it’s killing me,” she says. “I always think about why I did this and that scene like that. I’m just criticizing every scene so I’m not enjoying it at all.”</p><p>Asked which films she enjoys, she offers: “Some other people’s movies like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mike-leigh/\">Mike Leigh</a> and Kore-eda Hirokazu. Your Chinese movies I fell in love with. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/zhang-yimou/\">Zhang Yimou</a> when he started. Then later on when he became a big shot, I don’t enjoy [them]. [Laughs.]”</p><p>During the shoot, members of the cast and crew caught Lulu Wang’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kIky\"><i>The Farewell</i></a>, 2019’s powerful, heartfelt Chinese-American immigrant story. While Youn missed it (“I was just staying home trying to memorize the lines and resting”), Ye-ri watched with interest: “That film also had a grandmother character, so did ours, and these two are completely different. But at the same time from both films you can feel the warmth and thoughtfulness of grandmothers in different ways. To me they are both very lovely films.”</p><p>Of her recent viewings, Ye-ri reveals she found <a href=\"https://boxd.it/ioLA\"><i>Soul</i></a> made her as emotional as <i>Minari</i> did. “It made me look back at how I live and my day. It’s not necessarily for children but I think it’s a film for adults. [Pauses.] <a href=\"https://boxd.it/i4IQ\"><i>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</i></a>. I love that film also.”</p>"

There are plenty more we enjoyed, but these are the films we can’t stop thinking about.</p><p><!-- more --></p><h2>Documentary features</h2><!--figure[1]--><p><i><b>Summer of Soul (&hellip;Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)<br/></b></i><i>Directed by Ahmir-Khalib Thompson (AKA Questlove)</i></p><p>One hot summer five decades ago, there was a free concert series at a park in Harlem. It was huge, and it was lovely, and then it was forgotten. The Harlem Cultural Festival of 1969 brought together some of the world’s most beloved Black artists to connect with Black audiences. The star power and the size of the crowds alone should have been enough to immortalize the event à la Woodstock—which happened the same summer, the film emphasizes. But no one cared to buy up the footage until Ahmir-Khalib Thompson, better known as Questlove, came along.</p><p>It would have been easy to oversimplify such a rich archive by stringing together the performances, seeking out some talking heads, and calling it a day. But Questlove was both careful and ebullient in his approach. “<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbhu\">Summer of Soul</a></i> is a monumental concert documentary and a fantastic piece of reclaimed archived footage. There is perhaps no one better suited to curate this essential footage than Questlove, whose expertise and passion for the music shines through,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mjbreuer/film/summer-of-soul-or-when-the-revolution-could-not-be-televised/\">writes Matthew</a> on Letterboxd. The film is inventive with its use of present interviews, bringing in both artists and attendees not just to speak on their experiences, but to react to and relive the footage. The director reaches past the festival itself, providing thorough social context that takes in the moon landing, the assassinations of Black political figures, and more. By overlapping different styles of documentary filmmaking, Questlove’s directorial debut embraces the breadth and simultaneity of Black resilience and joy. A deserving winner of both the Grand Jury and Audience awards (and many of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/festiville/story/the-2021-letterboxd-sundance-awards/\">our unofficial Letterboxd awards</a>). —SH</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b><i>Flee<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Jonas Poher Rasmussen</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ponM\">Flee</a></i> is the type of discovery Sundance is designed for. Danish documentarian Jonas Poher Rasmussen tells the poignant story of his close friend and former classmate (using the pseudonym ‘Amin Nawabi’) and his daring escape from persecution in 1990s Afghanistan. Rasmussen always approaches tender topics with sensitivity and takes further steps to protect his friend’s identity by illustrating the film almost entirely in immersive animation, following in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ZFA\"><i>Waltz With Bashir</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dg60\"><i>Tower</i></a>. It’s a film aware of its subjectivity, allowing the animated scenes to alternate between the playful joy of nostalgia and the mournful pain of an unforgettable memory. However, these are intercepted by dramatic archive footage that oppressively brings the reality home.</p><p>“Remarkably singular, yet that is what makes it so universal,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1DB5Dv\">writes Paul</a>. “So many ugly truths about the immigration experience—the impossible choices forced upon people, and the inability to really be able to explain all of it to people in your new life… You can hear the longing in his voice, the fear in his whisper. Some don’t get the easy path.” Winner of the World Cinema (Documentary) Grand Jury Prize and quickly acquired by Neon, <i>Flee</i> is guaranteed to be a film you’ll hear a lot about for the rest of 2021. —JM</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b><i>Taming the Garden<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Salomé Jashi</i></p><p>There’s always a moment at a film festival when fatigue sets in, when the empathy machine overwhelms, and when I hit that moment in 2021, I took <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/641582902032941056/sundancing\">the advice of filmmaker and Sundance veteran Jim Cummings</a>, who told us: “If you’re ever stressed or tired, watch a documentary to reset yourself.” <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbkS\">Taming the Garden</a></i> wasn’t initially on my hit-list, but it’s one of those moments when the ‘close your eyes and point at a random title’ trick paid off. Documentary director Salomé Jashi does the Lorax’s work, documenting the impact and grief caused by billionaire former Georgian PM Bidzina Ivanishvili’s obsession with collecting ancient trees for his private arboretum.</p><p>“A movie that is strangely both infuriating and relaxing” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1D4I0h\">writes Todd</a>, of the long, locked-off wide shots showing the intense process of removing large, old trees from their village homes. There’s no narration, instead Jashi eavesdrops on locals as they gossip about Ivanishvili, argue about whether the money is worth it, and a feisty, irritated 90-year-old warns of the impending environmental fallout. “What you get out of it is absolutely proportional to what you put into it,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1DeQnt\">writes David</a>, who recommends this film get the IMAX treatment. It’s arboriculture as ASMR, the timeline cleanse my Sundance needed. The extraordinary images of treasured trees being barged across the sea will become iconic. —GG</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b><i>The Most Beautiful Boy in the World<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Kristian Petri and Kristina Lindström</i></p><p>Where <i>Taming the Garden</i> succeeds through pure observation, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/rnpw\">The Most Beautiful Boy in the World</a></i> relies on the complete participation of its title subject, actor Björn Andrésen, who was thrust into the spotlight as a teenager. Cast by Italian director Lucino Visconti in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/21tm\">Death in Venice</a></i>, a 1971 adaptation of Thomas Mann’s novella about obsession and fatal longing, Andrésen spent the 1970s as an object of lust, with a side-gig as a blonde pop star in Japan, inspiring many manga artists along the way.</p><p>As we know by now (Alex Winter’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lxpO\">Showbiz Kids</a></i> is a handy companion to this film), young stardom comes at a price, one that Andrésen was not well-placed to pay even before his fateful audition for Visconti. But he’s still alive, still acting (he’s Dan in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\">Midsommar</a></i>), and ready to face the mysteries of his past. Like Benjamin Ree’s excellent <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ojPk\">The Painter and the Thief</a></i> from last year, this documentary is a constantly unfolding detective story, notable for great archive footage, and a deep kindness towards its reticent yet wide-open subject. —GG</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b><i>All Light, Everywhere<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Theo Anthony</i></p><p>Threading the blind spots between Étienne-Jules Marey’s 19th-century “photographic rifle”, camera-carrying war pigeons and Axon’s body-cam tech, Theo Anthony’s inquisitive, mind-expanding doc about the false promise of the all-seeing eye is absorbing, scary, urgent. It’s the greatest <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aWi\">Minority Report</a></i> origin story you didn’t know you needed.</p><p>Augmented by Dan Deacon’s electronic soundscapes and Keaver Brenai’s lullingly robotic narration, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/l5q0\">All Light, Everywhere</a></i> proves to be a captivating, intricately balanced experience that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hmayersohn/film/all-light-everywhere/\">Harris describes</a> as “one part Adam Curtis-esque cine-essay”, “one part structural experiment in the vein of Koyaanisqatsi” and “one part accidental character study of two of the most familiar yet strikingly unique evil, conservative capitalists…”. Yes, there’s a tremendous amount to download, but Anthony’s expert weaving, as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/acwebster/film/all-light-everywhere/\">AC writes</a>, “make its numerous subjects burst with clarity and profundity.” For curious cinephiles, the oldest movie on Letterboxd, Jules Jenssen’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/passage-of-venus/\"><i>Passage de Vénus</i></a> (1874), makes a cameo. —AY</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b><i>The Sparks Brothers</i></b><br/><i>Directed by Edgar Wright</i></p><p>Conceived at a Sparks gig in 2017 upon the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/1356527460519731200\">encouragement of fellow writer-director Phil Lord</a>, Edgar Wright broke his streak of riotous comedies with his first  (of many, we hope) rockumentary. While somewhat overstuffed—this is, after all, his longest film by nearly fifteen minutes—<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tboq\">The Sparks Brothers</a></i> speaks only to Wright’s unrestrained passion for his art-pop Gods, exploring all the nooks and crannies of Sparks’ sprawling career, with unprecedented access to brothers and bandmates Ron and Russell Mael.</p><p>Nobody else can quite pin them down, so Wright dedicates his time to put every pin in them while he can, building a mythology and breaking it down, while coloring the film with irresistible dives into film history, whimsically animated anecdotes and cheeky captions. “Sparks rules. Edgar Wright rules. There’s no way this wasn’t going to rule”, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1De9Pp\">proclaims Nick</a>, “every Sparks song is its own world, with characters, rules, jokes and layers of narrative irony. What a lovely ode to a creative partnership that was founded on sticking to one’s artistic guns, no matter what may have been fashionable at the time.” —JM</p><h2>Narrative features</h2><!--figure[7]--><p><b><i>The Pink Cloud<br/></i></b><i>Written and directed by Iuli Gerbase</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbjA\">The Pink Cloud</a></i> is disorienting and full of déjà vu. Brazilian writer-director Iuli Gerbase constructs characters that are damned to have to settle when it comes to human connection. Giovana and Yago’s pleasant one-night stand lasts longer than expected when the titular pink cloud emerges from the sky, full of a mysterious and deadly gas that forces everyone to stay locked where they stand. Sound familiar? Reserve your groans—<i>The Pink Cloud</i> wasn’t churned out to figure out “what it all means” before the pandemic is even over. Gerbase wrote and shot the film prior to the discovery of Covid-19.</p><p>It’s “striking in its ability to prophesize a pandemic and a feeling unknown at the time of its conception. What was once science fiction hits so close now,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bamsaum/film/the-pink-cloud/\">writes Sam</a>. As uncanny as the quarantine narrative feels, what’s truly harrowing is how well the film predicts and understands interiorities that the pandemic later exacerbated. Above all, Giovana is a woman with unmet needs. She is a good partner, good mother and good person even when she doesn’t want to be. Even those who love her cannot see how their expectations strip her of her personhood, and the film dares to ask what escape there might be when love itself leaves you lonely. —SH</p><!--figure[8]--><p><b><i>Together Together<br/></i></b><i>Written and directed by Nikole Beckwith</i></p><p>Every festival needs at least one indie relationship dramedy, and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbg2\">Together Together</a></i> filled that role at Sundance 2021 with a healthy degree of subversion. It follows rom-com structure while ostensibly avoiding romance, instead focusing on how cultivating adult friendships can be just hard, if not harder.</p><p>Writer-director Nikole Beckwith warmly examines the limits of the platonic, and Patti Harrison and Ed Helms are brilliantly cast as the not-couple: a single soon-to-be father and the surrogate carrying his child. They poke at each other’s boundaries with a subtle desperation to know what makes a friendship appropriate or real. As <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jacobsever/film/together-together/\">Jacob writes</a>: “It’s cute and serious, charming without being quirky. It’s a movie that deals with the struggle of being alone in this world, but offers a shimmer of hope that even if you don’t fall in fantastical, romantic, Hollywood love… there are people out there for you.” —SH</p><!--figure[9]--><p><b><i>Hive<br/></i></b><i>Written and directed by Blerta Basholli</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbiM\">Hive</a></i>, for some, may fall into the “nothing much happens” slice-of-life genre, but Blerta Basholli’s directorial debut holds an ocean of pain in its small tale, asking us to consider the heavy lifting that women must always do in the aftermath of war. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1DE0bx\">As Liz writes</a>, “<i>Hive</i> is not just a story about grief and trauma in a patriarchy-dominated culture, but of perseverance and the bonds created by the survivors who must begin to consider the future without their husbands.”</p><p>Yllka Gashi is an understated hero as Fahrjie, a mother-of-two who sets about organizing work for the women of her village, while awaiting news of her missing husband—one of thousands unaccounted for, years after the Kosovo War has ended. The townsmen have many opinions about how women should and shouldn’t mourn, work, socialize, parent, drive cars and, basically, get on with living, but Fahrjie persists, and Basholli sticks close with an unfussy, tender eye. “It felt like I was a fly on the wall, witnessing something that was actually happening,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1DAlEH\">writes Arthur</a>. Just as in Robin Wright’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/m5b2\"><i>Land</i></a> and Mona Fastvold’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iiuI\"><i>The World to Come</i></a>, <i>Hive</i> pays off in the rare, beaming smile of its protagonist. —GG</p><!--figure[10]--><p><b><i>On the Count of Three<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Jerrod Carmichael, written by Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch</i></p><p>It starts with an image: two best friends pointing guns at each other’s heads. There’s no anger, there’s no hatred—this is an act of merciful brotherly love. How do you have a bleak, gun-totin’ buddy-comedy in 2021 and be critically embraced without contradicting your gun-control retweets or appearing as though your film is the dying embers of Tarantino-tinged student films?</p><p>Comedian Jerrod Carmichael’s acerbic directorial debut <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbfI\">On the Count of Three</a></i> achieves this by calling it out every step of the way. Guns are a tool to give insecure men the illusion of power. They are indeed a tool too terrifying to trust in the hands of untrained citizens. Carmichael also stars, alongside Christopher Abbott, who has never been more hilarious or more tragic, bringing pathos to a cathartic rendition of Papa Roach’s ‘Last Resort’. Above all, Carmichael and Abbott’s shared struggle and bond communicates the millennial malaise: how can you save others if you can’t save yourself? “Here’s what it boils down to: life is fucking hard”, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1CNNV9\">Laura sums up</a>, “and sometimes the most we can hope for is to have a best friend who loves you [and] to be a best friend who loves. It doesn’t make life any easier, but it sure helps.” Sundance 2021 is one for the books when it comes to documentaries, but <i>On the Count of Three</i> stands out in the fiction lineup this year. —JM</p><!--figure[11]--><p><b><i>Censor<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Prano Bailey-Bond, written by Bailey-Bond and Anthony Fletcher</i></p><p>The first of several upcoming films inspired by the ‘video nasty’ moral panic over gory horror in mid-’80s Britain, Prano Bailey-Bond leans heavily into both the period and the genre in telling the story of a film censor (a phenomenal Niamh Algar—vulnerable and steely at the same time) who begins to suspect a banned movie may hold the key to her sister’s childhood disappearance. Often dreamlike, occasionally phantasmagorical and repeatedly traumatic, even if the worst gore presented (as seen in the impressively authentic fictional horrors being appraised) appears via a screen, providing a welcome degree of separation.</p><p>Nevertheless, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oHFS\">Censor</a></i> is definitely not for the faint of heart, but old-school horror aficionados will squeal with delight at the aesthetic commitment. “I’m so ecstatic that horror is in the hands of immensely talented women going absolutely batshit in front of and behind the camera.” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/enniomorricone/film/censor-2021/\">writes Erik</a>. (Same here!) “A great ode to the video-nasty era and paying tribute to the great horror auteurs of the ’80s such as Argento, De Palma and Cronenberg while also doing something new with the genre. Loved this!” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/johnbizub_1004/film/censor-2021\">writes John</a>, effectively encapsulating <i>Censor</i>’s unfettered film-nerd appeal. —DC</p><!--figure[12]--><p><b><i>CODA<br/></i></b><i>Written and directed by Siân Heder</i></p><p>A film so earnest it shouldn’t work, with a heart so big it should surely not fit the size of the screen, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbf4\">CODA</a></i> broke records (the first US dramatic film in Sundance history to win all three top prizes; the 25-million-dollar sale to Apple Studios), and won the world over like no other film. “A unique take on something we’ve seen so much,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/amandathejedi/film/coda-2021/\">writes Amanda</a>, nailing the special appeal of Siân Heder’s coming-of-ager and family portrait. Emilia Jones plays Ruby, the only hearing person in her deaf family, at war between the family business and her passion for singing. While Heder is technically remaking the French film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/9HYg\">La Famille Bélier</a></i>, the decision to cast brilliant deaf actors—Troy Kotsur, Marlee Matlin and Daniel Durant—makes this feel brand new.</p><p>But it’s not just about representation for the sake of it. A sense of authenticity, in humor as much as affection, shines through. With a script that’s 40 per cent ASL, so many of the jokes are visual gags, poking fun at Tinder and rap music, but a lot of the film’s most poignant moments are silent as well. And in Ruby’s own world, too, choir kids will feel seen. “I approve of this very specific alto representation and the brilliant casting of the entire choir,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/elaurapictures/\">Laura confirms in her review</a>. Come for the fearless, empathetic family portrait, stay for the <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1V0y\">High School Musical</a></i> vibes that actually ring true. —EK</p><!--figure[13]--><p><b><i>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair<br/></i></b><i>Written and directed by Jane Schoenbrun</i></p><p>Perhaps the most singular addition to the recent flurry of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/newarchive/list/extremely-online\">Extremely Online</a> cinema—<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/hDPg\">Searching</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiiO\">Spree</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/r5O4\">Host</a>,</i> et al—Jane Schoenbrun’s feature debut ushers the viewer into a haunted, hypno-drone miasma of delirium-inducing YouTube time-suck, tenebrous creepypasta lore and painfully intimate webcam confessionals. Featuring an extraordinarily unaffected, fearless performance by newcomer Anna Cobb, the film “unpacks the mythology of adolescence in a way that’s so harrowingly familiar and also so otherworldly”, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kristenyoonsoo/film/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair/\">writes Kristen</a>. Not since Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1s3y\">Pulse</a></i> has there been such an eerily lonely, and at times strangely beautiful, evocation of the liminal spaces between virtual and real worlds.</p><p>For members of the trans community, it’s also a work that translates that experience to screen with uncommon authenticity. “What Schoenbrun has accomplished with the form of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tbmY\">We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</a></i> is akin to catching a wisp of smoke,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/catelyn/film/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair/\">writes Willow</a>, “because the images, mood and aesthetic that they have brought to life is one that is understood completely by trans people as one of familiarity, without also plunging into the obvious melodrama, or liberal back-patting that is usually associated with ‘good’ direct representation.” One of the most original, compelling new voices to emerge from Sundance this year. —AY</p><!--figure[14]--><p><b><i>Judas and the Black Messiah<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Shaka King, written by King, Will Berson, Kenneth Lucas and Keith Lucas</i></p><p>It was always going to take a visionary, uncompromising filmmaker to bring the story of Fred Hampton, the deputy chairman of the national Black Panther Party, to life. Shaka King casts Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton, and LaKeith Stanfield as William “Wild Bill” O’Neal, the FBI informant whose betrayal leads to Hampton’s assassination. Both actors have never been better, particularly Kaluuya who <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/franhoepfner/film/judas-and-the-black-messiah/\">Fran Hoepfner calls</a> “entrancing, magnetic, fizzling, romantic, riveting, endlessly watchable.”</p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lsew\">Judas and the Black Messiah</a></i> is an electric, involving watch: not just replaying history by following a certain biopic template. Instead, it’s a film with something to say—on power, on fear, on war and on freedom. “Shaka King’s name better reverberate through the halls of every studio after this,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/demiadejuyigbe/film/judas-and-the-black-messiah/likes/\">Demi</a>. A talent like this, capable of framing such a revolution, doesn’t come around so often. We’d better listen up. —EK</p><!--figure[15]--><p><b><i>Pleasure<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Ninja Thyberg, written by Thyberg and Peter Modestij</i></p><p>A24’s first purchase of 2021. Ironically titled on multiple levels, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lPcy\">Pleasure</a></i> is a brutal film that you endure more than enjoy. But one thing you can’t do is forget it. Ninja Thyberg’s debut feature follows a young Swedish woman (Sofia Kappel) who arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of porn stardom under the name ‘Bella Cherry’. Although Bella is clear-eyed about the business she’s getting into, Thyberg doesn’t shy away from any of the awfulness she faces in order to succeed in an industry rife with exploitation and abuse. Bella does make allies, and the film isn’t suggesting that porn is only stocked with villains, but the ultimate cost is clear, even if it ends on an ever-so-slightly ambiguous note.</p><p>Touching as it does on ambition, friendship and betrayal in the sex business, <i>Pleasure</i> is often oddly reminiscent of Paul Verhoeven’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Vmk\">Showgirls</a></i>. Or rather, the gritty film <i>Showgirls</i> was claiming to be, as opposed to the camp classic it became. There’s nothing campy here. Kappel is raw and fearless in the lead, but never lets the viewer lose touch with her humanity. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/erf45/film/film:520171/\">Emma puts it well:</a> “Kappel gives the hardest, most provocative and transfixing performance I’ve seen all festival.” “My whole body was physically tense during this,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rebel_/film/film:520171/\">writes Gillian</a>, while Keegan perhaps speaks for most when <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/keeganhewlett/film/film:520171/\">she says</a> “Great film, never want to see it again.” —DC</p><!--figure[16]--><p><b><i>Coming Home in the Dark<br/></i></b><i>Directed by James Ashcroft, written by Ashcroft and Eli Kent</i></p><p>A family camping trip amidst some typically stunnin—and casually foreboding— New Zealand scenery is upended by a shocking rug-pull of violence that gives way to sustained terror represented by Daniel Gillies’ disturbingly calm psychopath. The set-up of this thriller initially suggests a spin on the backwoods brutality thriller, but as <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/qDN8\">Coming Home in the Dark</a></i> progresses and hope dissipates, the motivations reveal themselves to be much more personal in nature, and informed on a thematic level by New Zealand’s colonial crimes against its Indigenous population. It’s a stark and haunting film that remains disorientating and unpredictable throughout, repeatedly daring the viewer to anticipate what will happen next, only to casually stomp on each glimmer of a positive outcome.</p><p>It’s so captivatingly bleak that a viewing of it, as Collins Ezeanyim’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cezeanyim/film/coming-home-in-the-dark/\">eloquent reaction</a> points out, does not lend itself to completing domestic tasks. The film marks an auspicious debut for director and co-writer James Ashcroft. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jacobknight/film/coming-home-in-the-dark/\">Jacob writes</a> that he “will probably follow James Ashcroft’s career to the gates of Hell after this one”. Justin hits the nail on the head with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jlalibs/film/coming-home-in-the-dark/\">his description</a>: “Lean and exceptionally brutal road/revenge film … that trades in genre tropes, especially those of Ozploitation and ’70s Italian exploitation, but contextualizes them in the dark history of its country of origin.” —DC</p><!--figure[17]--><p><b><i>The World to Come<br/></i></b><i>Directed by Mona Fastvold, written by Ron Hansen and Jim Shepard</i></p><p>Mona Fastvold has not made the first, nor probably the last, period romance about forbidden lesbian love. But <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/iiuI\">The World to Come</a></i> focuses on a specific pocket in time, a world contained in Jim Shepard’s short story ‘Love &amp; Hydrogen’ from within the collection giving the film its name. Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby are Abigail and Tallie, farming neighbors, stifled by their husbands, who find brief moments of solace, of astonishment and joy, together. What shines here is the script, a verbose, delicate narration that emanates beauty more than pretence. “So beautifully restrained and yet I felt everything,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ianamurray/film/the-world-to-come/\">Iana writes</a>.</p><p>And you can feel the fluidity and elegance in the way the film sounds, too: composer Daniel Blumberg’s clarinet theme converses with the dialogue and tells you when your heart can break, when you must pause, when the end is near. “So much heartache. So much hunger. So much longing. Waves of love and grief and love and grief,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/clairacurtis/\">writes Claira</a>, capturing the ebb and flow of emotion that keeps <i>The World to Come</i> in your mind long after the screen has gone silent. —EK</p>"

How do you feel about accidentally hitting that unfortunate zeitgeist and now consequently being asked questions like this one?<br/></b>Yeah, strange. The questions are fine. If it wasn’t this one, it would be another that you would have to answer over and over again. One of the things that drew me to the project was that it felt like a fantasy that wasn’t necessarily rooted in reality in a way that my other [films] were. I liked that it’s old-fashioned in its attempts to purely take you somewhere and wasn’t intended to hold up a mirror to our times—but then in the end that’s exactly what it’s doing. I’m curious myself, and I’m checking Letterboxd to see the reactions from people because I really couldn’t guess what it would have been like [now].</p><p><b>Are there any prescient details you’re proud of getting right?<br/></b>I’m so grateful and happy that Jack [O’Connell] is wearing his mask correctly. That’s the number one thing that I’m glad we got right. I think it was very smart of Mattson to focus the movie on [the relationship] rather than the details of this global pandemic. I feel the reason it’s not in bad taste is because it dealt with those things as a backdrop and instead focused on people just trying to remember what’s important and clinging onto those that they love.</p><p><b>Onto our own favorite memory aid, Letterboxd. How did you discover us and how did you manage without us?<br/></b>I’ve been on since 2013, so I’m probably one of the earliest people to jump on it. I love the interface and the diary, just aesthetically it was really fun. I’ve been keeping track of what I see with analog [methods] for as long as I can remember. I have diaries and planners so I logged all that old information. If I was running for president, my platform would be that everybody is required to use Letterboxd comprehensively, because I just love to know what everybody is watching all the time.</p><p><b>Do you talk about Letterboxd in the real world with the other filmmaking people?<br/></b>Yes, and I’m often trying to convince them to join. Other filmmakers are more concerned about having their opinions on peers be public knowledge than I am, I guess. I’ve made four films now and each one’s been bigger and more widely seen than the last. The <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3uDW\">very first one</a> was a total no-budget affair that couldn’t get into any festivals and I was very excited when I finally got it into the Hamptons Film Festival. It was about half-full and one or two people came up to me afterwards and said they liked it. This was pre-Twitter so I spent the whole next day Googling to see if anybody had written anything. I was so curious to see what people thought and there was nothing—not a review, not a blog—just total emptiness.</p><p>When <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4Y8c\">the next film</a> got into Sundance, there were people tweeting their reactions and actual reviews and I read everything. People were asking if the bad reviews hurt me. Absolutely not—nothing can be worse than the radio silence of nobody caring about the first film. The fact that people care enough to sit and write about this movie—good or bad—is a win, and I’ve carried that onward. I like to see what people think, it can be helpful in how you view the film as a success or failure. You learn and move on.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Some filmmakers have told us they’re kinder to films after making their own, but you’re not shy at all about being critical. How did making your own films change your perspective as a critic?<br/></b>I don’t consider myself a critic so that’s why I’d be less concerned with someone reading what I thought. Why should they put any stock into what I think? If they get hung up on it then that’s their own stuff because I’m not a critic. Like everyone else on Letterboxd, I just love watching movies. Obviously I can appreciate and understand some of the technical aspects maybe moreso than people who don’t make films, but at the end of the day, rarely that’s the thing that makes you love a movie or not. There’s a great bit in Francis Ford Coppola’s commentary track for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/Wre\"><i>Finian’s Rainbow</i></a> where Fred Astaire’s doing a dance number and [Coppola admits] he totally messed it up because Astaire’s feet aren’t fully in frame. He’s very honest about his mistakes because it’s one of his earliest movies. Then he goes on to say that he thinks there’s the same number of mistakes in <i>Finian’s Rainbow</i> as there are in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aNK\"><i>The Godfather</i></a>, it’s just that he made mistakes on the things that don’t matter for <i>The Godfather</i>. No film is perfect, but if it can latch onto this one magical aspect that connects you to it, that’s what makes you love it or not.</p><p><b>You had a project where you chart the best films made by directors at certain ages as you reached that age. Tell us more about it.<br/></b>That was a great project. I got the idea <a href=\"https://boxd.it/8IPO\">when I was 26</a>. This was back when I had a Netflix DVD subscription and it was just hard for me to randomly choose DVDs to throw in the queue. I needed a system. I decided to watch movies from directors when they were my age and see if there’s some common denominator, something I can learn. At that point, there weren’t many, there were films like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/23um\"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/rainer-werner-fassbinder/by/release-earliest/\">Fassbinder films</a>. Not many people had made stuff when they were 26 or 27, so it was very feasible. Every year there were more movies and more directors to add to the list and it became time-consuming. I did it all the way up <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1e3km\">until I was 34</a> and the reason I stopped was because I had a son and there was no way I could continue this level of viewing output.</p><p><b>My favorite part of your account is the fact that you log every viewing of your own films. You know for a fact that you’ve watched <i>Morris From America</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chad_hartigan/film/morris-from-america/activity/\">26 times</a> and <i>Little Fish</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chad_hartigan/film/little-fish-2020/activity/\">fifteen times</a>. Why do you log them? What counts as a viewing?<br/></b>I’ve clearly watched those movies many more times in little chunks but I’ll only log it if we’re sitting down and watching it from beginning to end. I have a ticket to see <i>Little Fish</i> in the drive-in on Saturday, so it’s going to be logged again. Why do I do it? Like I said, I wish everyone was required to use Letterboxd comprehensively. That’s what it’s there for for me, an accurate log of what I watch. This is psychotic behavior but I’m tempted to have a Letterboxd account for my son. I’ll do his views for him once he starts watching movies until he’s old enough to take over. It’ll just be, like, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3GNa\"><i>Frozen</i></a> a thousand times but he’s not old enough to watch anything yet, so we’ll see.</p><p><b>Have you discovered any films thanks to Letterboxd discourse that influenced your approach to filmmaking?<br/></b>For sure, I can’t maybe say specifically, but once I dropped the directors my own age system I didn’t replace it with nothing. I’m a Virgo and I have a little bit of OCD, so I have to have some system. I’ve replaced it with a new complicated system where I pull from different lists and that’s now my main source of how I choose a movie to watch. I have like ten or twelve different lists, each about a thousand movies with a lot of overlap. One of them is my own list of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/omOm\">every movie I’ve seen in a theater</a> and I’ll go and look through that and if it’s something I want to revisit. Recently I rewatched <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29S0\">Twister</a>,</i> which I hadn’t seen in a long time and is an old favorite from when I was in high school.</p><p>I have a bunch of private lists I cycle through; every movie nominated for a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lKQ6\">Spirit Award</a>, every movie that’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/17reI\">won an Oscar</a>, every movie that’s played in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/D2eI\">competition at Cannes</a>, the top 1,000 films at <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1S1qM\">the box office</a>. There’s another great website that I use as a biblical resource which is <a href=\"http://theyshootpictures.com/\">They Shoot Pictures, Don’t They?</a> and their lists of acclaimed films for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/b0gAk\">all-time</a> and the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4RKMo\">21st century</a>. I hit those up often. Something that I watched purely because of the very high Letterboxd rating and really loved is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Cg\"><i>Funeral Parade of Roses</i></a>. I try to see as many movies as I can that have a 4.0 rating or higher.</p><p><b>You respect the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5RaoE\">Letterboxd consensus</a>.<br/></b>I do, but I don’t always agree with it.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Which is your most underrated or overlooked movie according to Letterboxd?<br/></b>I can say I was the very first person to log a movie called <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2HC6\">Witness in the City</a></i>, which is an Italian noir movie I watched when I was doing my ‘directors my own age’ series. Literally nobody had logged it, so <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2HBkh\">my review</a> was like “whoa, I can’t believe I’m the first person to log this!”. It was very exciting for me because it’s great, but I’m the OG logger of that movie.</p><p><b>From your list of every film you’ve seen in a theater since you were twelve, which was your most memorable experience?<br/></b>The cheap answer is that it’s hard to top my own movies. The Sundance premiere of <i>Morris From America</i> at the Eccles Theater is maybe the best, but if I’m disqualifying my own films, seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/24Ei\"><i>Scream 3</i></a> in a very packed theater in Virginia Beach was really fun, really rowdy. There was a trailer for a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie and I remember the climax was Van Damme going “you lied to me!!!” and everyone laughed. Someone did a George Costanza move later during <i>Scream 3</i> and yelled out “you lied to me!!!” and everybody laughed again—so that’s a high. That’s the thing I miss the most about movie theaters, and the worry I have if theaters go away, is that so much of how we feel about a movie can be tied to the experience; who we saw it with, what we did before or after, what the crowd was like, or if anything strange happened. There are a lot of movies I have strong memories and affection for because of the experience of seeing them and I probably wouldn’t feel the same way about if I just watched it at home on my laptop.</p><p><b>I typically like to cap interviews off with what filmmakers thought was the best film of the past year, but we have your data to hand. For you, it’s Garrett Bradley’s documentary <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1t9vUh\"><i>Time</i></a>. Can you talk a bit about what makes the film stand out for you?<br/></b>One thing I learned about myself from the pandemic is that the motivation and desire to see new things is very closely tied to the theater-going experience for me. Once that was taken away and you could watch a new movie at home, it joins the pile of all the other movies. The fact that it’s new doesn’t really do anything for me. Why would I press play on <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnXw\"><i>Da 5 Bloods</i></a> when I still haven’t seen <a href=\"https://boxd.it/27WE\"><i>Malcolm X</i></a>? I gotta see <i>Malcolm X</i>! There wasn’t an urgency, so I saw far fewer films than in an ordinary year. But <i>Time</i> I found incredibly moving and important. Similar to what I liked about the <i>Little Fish</i> script, it’s so hyper-focused on one relationship and within that one story it has so much to say about larger issues and the world at large. It was an emotional and rich viewing experience.</p>"

While the elder Miyazaki has only lately come to express interest in CG animation in the form of his 2018 short film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ipeW\">Boro the Caterpillar</a></i>, Gorō, by contrast, has wholeheartedly embraced the medium, marking a clear and distinct break between his own aesthetic sensibilities and those of his father.</p><!--figure[1]--><p>“If I were to create [a] hand-drawn TV anime series now, I would only be following a path carved out by Hayao Miyazaki and others as a latecomer,” Miyazaki told <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150221155612/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/views/opinion/AJ201502180014\">Asahi Shimbun in 2015</a>. “Well, I wouldn’t like that. Expression by computer graphics remains incomplete, so both the workers and myself believe that there still remains something that we could do.” In choosing to pursue CG animation, Gorō Miyazaki is free to be held to no precedent other than his own.</p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/pu34\">Earwig and the Witch</a></i>, Miyazaki’s first feature-length film since 2013’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2VCa\">From Up on Poppy Hill</a></i> and Studio Ghibli’s first-ever feature-length CG-animated film, is another push forward. Adapted from Diana Wynne Jones’ 2011 children’s book, the film was made for Japanese television, but is being released theatrically elsewhere. The film tells the story of Earwig, a clever and precocious young orphan who, unbeknownst to her, is the daughter of a powerful witch on the run from malevolent forces. When she is adopted by the witch Bella Yaga and a mysterious shapeshifter known as the Mandrake, Earwig must use every ounce of her wits, charm and guile to assert command of her new life and learn the secret of her foster parent’s history.</p><p>Early Letterboxd reviews for <i>Earwig and the Witch</i> are mixed—such is the fervor for Ghibli’s hand-drawn masterpieces, comparisons will always exist, and there’s a common feeling that the film’s ending is abrupt (possibly setting things up for a sequel). Those who have enjoyed <i>Earwig and the Witch</i>, however, write that it is “<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1BTPRr\">solid, undeniably charming and lovely</a>” and hope that “<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1BOoM5\">people who watch this will go in with an open mind and [refrain from] judging Earwig unfairly</a>”.</p><p>We talked with Miyazaki over Zoom to discuss his motivations for adapting the book, the anime and films that have inspired and motivated him throughout his career, and what he would most want to be remembered for as a director.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Most of your films are adaptations of writers like Ursula Le Guin, Astrid Lindgren and now Diana Wynne Jones. What did you feel when you read the original <i>Earwig and the Witch</i> novel for the first time? What inspired you to turn it into a film?<br/></b><i>Gorō Miyazaki:</i> When I first read the book, there were two things that really stuck out as very interesting to me. The first one was the protagonist, Earwig. I love the fact that she wasn’t portrayed as your typical, good obedient girl. She’s someone who, when she knows what she wants in her life, in order to achieve those goals, she doesn’t hesitate to use people or make people do as she wants them to do. And even in scenes where something bad happens and she could cry, she doesn’t cry. She’s strong-willed and works to overcome those challenges. She acts and works to come up with ideas of how she could overcome these challenges, so those traits of that character really appealed to me.</p><p>The other thing was how Jones portrays the concept of magic in the book. Bella Yaga, the witch, while she’s making all these magical spells and potions in the workshop, there’s also a physical sort of work at play. She has to blend these elements and ingredients, the mystical and the physical, and mix them together. So to see someone create magic in that way was a very intriguing idea to me.</p><p><b>What kind of stories do you typically enjoy reading? What are some of your favorite books, and what are you reading right now?<br/></b>In terms of fiction and fantasy, I’m a fan of Dianne Wynne Jones’ writing. What I like about her stories is that they have a lot of quirky characters. Sometimes the protagonist will be someone who would be quite difficult to interact with in real life. The characters have flaws and dimensions. They’re not often one-dimensional, neither good or bad. Her characters have different sides to them that make them really attractive and charming. In terms of books I regularly read though, I tend to prefer reading more non-fiction books than fantasy.</p><p><b>How did the experience of working on <i>Ronia</i>, a 3DCG-animated series, prepare you for the experience working on this film? Do you feel you’ve grown as a director since your last film in 2011?<br/></b>It’s hard to tell whether you’ve grown or not by yourself, but in terms of working in 3DCG with <i>Ronja, the Robber’s Daughter</i>, I was able to see what the possibilities of working with 3DCG were in terms of being able to [make] the characters act more, perform more, and show a different range of emotions. With <i>Earwig and the Witch</i>, I wanted to make it a story that was less driven by the [narrative], but driven by the characters and their performances, such as Earwig’s reactions, expressions, thoughts and feelings. I would say that the experience I had with <i>Ronja</i> was very much a learning experience and place to experiment with different ideas. Each episode of <i>Ronja</i> would have a different challenge—where for one episode I would try to make it into more of a comedy, the next episode would be just the two main child characters talking with each other, and then there were episodes with elements of horror or violence featured throughout. It was a place for me to explore and experiment with what was possible through 3DCG animation.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>What were some of your favorite animated films growing up that you return to for either inspiration and entertainment?<br/></b>I try to avoid going back to reference these animations or to emulate exactly what they did, but in terms of memorable and impressive anime from when I was growing up, Hayao Miyazaki’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Mn4\">Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro</a></i> is one that I still hold dear. I wouldn’t call myself a hardcore movie or anime fan. My generation grew up during a period when anime became huge in Japan, so Leiji Matsumoto’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/JhA\"><i>Space Battleship Yamato</i></a> (1977) and Yoshiyuki Tomino’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/pMta\">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></i> (1979–1981) were very popular at the time. I remember watching those and them leaving a big impression on me, as well as films like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/72s\">Star Wars</a></i> (1977). I remember going to the theater when it first came out and that had a big impact on me.</p><p>A while back I was wondering who I went to see <i>Star Wars</i> with when it first came out, I couldn’t remember who I actually went with. So when I went back to my parents’ house and we were talking about this, it turns out the entire family went to go see the film. So I actually went to go see <i>Star Wars</i> with my father, Hayao Miyazaki! The second one, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/27Vw\">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>, my mother told us, “I don’t need to go and see this,” and so I remember going to see that one with my dad and my brother as well.</p><p><b>Your films often touch on the relationship between a child and their parent. How has your relationship with your son inspired your work? What films do you love watching with him?<br/></b>I’ll usually go and watch whatever film he wants to see [laughs]. Most recently we went to go see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/nyLU\">the new <i>Demon Slayer</i> movie</a>. I thought it was very interesting, I felt like it had a freshness about it. Even with hand-drawn animation, I could tell it was done by a younger, ambitious generation of animators trying to accomplish something new.</p><p><b>What have been some of your favorite 3DCG animated films in recent years that have inspired you as a creator working in the medium?<br/></b>I love all of Pete Docter’s works at Pixar. I haven’t seen <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ioLA\">Soul</a></i> yet, his latest film, but I loved <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/4KHC\">Inside Out</a></i> and I loved <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a46\">Monsters, Inc</a></i>. when it first came out. I really enjoyed Tian Xiao Peng&rsquo;s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/bPhy\">Monkey King: Hero Is Back</a></i>. What I loved about their films was that, as the audience, you could feel the energy, devotion and enthusiasm of the creators wanting to create something great using CG through the art form of animation.</p><p><b>As a director, what kind of stories are you most interested in telling? What would you ideally want your work to be known and remembered for?<br/></b>When I make an animation, it’s not that I don’t want adults to enjoy it, but I really want to make films for children to watch. Something that will inspire them in how to live their lives as they grow older and go into the world, something that might encourage them and offer hope. In terms of how I’d like to be remembered, I hope people will remember me as someone who always came up with something different than what they would’ve expected, and [from] what he did before. Not inconsistent, but someone who was always exploring new and challenging possibilities.</p>"

Letterboxd’s West Coast editor <b>Dominic Corry</b> advises getting into the Park City swing of things right from breakfast: “Place a headshot next to your coffee machine to replicate the experience of bumping into an A-lister at the Starbucks in Fresh Market”.</p><p>Before your first screening of the day, say <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiNW\">Boys State</a></i> directors <b>Jesse Moss</b> and <b>Amanda McBaine</b> (Sundance 2020), “Stand outside in the cold for sixty minutes before viewing the film, then watch the film while wearing a very heavy parka, and realize you’re very hot twenty minutes into the movie and have to wrestle your parka off whilst not disturbing your fellow viewers.”</p><p>Or, don’t even bother trying to remove those layers, says <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/m0e6\">And Then We Danced</a></i> writer-director <b>Levan Akin</b> (Sundance 2020): “Recreate the sweat-soaked sensation I had by dressing in thermal long johns to outsmart the cold, only to sit through screenings in a pool of your own sweat. Rookie mistake!”</p><p>Between screenings, you have a couple of options. “Hit that StairMaster between virtual engagements to simulate the high mountain altitude,” advises <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lCXQ\">Palm Springs</a></i> director <b>Max Barbakow</b> (Sundance 2020), ”and don’t forget that chlorophyll to catch your wind!”</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kentucker/\"><b>Kentucker Audley</b></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/albertbirney/\"><b>Albert Birney</b></a>, writers and directors of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/tblG\">Strawberry Mansion</a></i> (Sundance 2021) have an alternate suggestion: “After a screening, we recommend turning off the heat in your home, getting into your bathtub (imagining it’s a hot tub), and once it’s nice and freezing in your house, get out of the tub with wet feet, step directly into your snow boats and race to the nearest towel, which for some reason is nowhere near you. Then watch another movie and repeat the process.” Seems eerily legit.</p><!--figure[2]--><h2>Creating those creature comforts.</h2><p>For those of you who have long since accepted that we’re on the sofa rather than the slopes this Sundance, the trick is to make home as inviting as possible, despite its being far too familiar these days. That could mean moving the screen from its usual spot. <b>Heidi Ewing</b>, writer and director of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiia\">I Carry You With Me</a></i> (Sundance 2020) has a three-step plan: “1. Carmel-corn 2. Bathtub with bubbles 3. Play it loud—bathroom-tile acoustics will make it all feel bigger and boomier. That’s my sage advice.”</p><p>“Definitely co-sign the bathtub!” agrees Letterboxd’s London correspondent <b>Ella Kemp</b>. “And I’d also suggest watching the midnight-leaning stuff—big horror, big genre, big WTF—first thing in the morning, if you can. I do not have the same energy late at night in my own at home as I do with a sold-out crowd.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p>Indeed, energy for film festivals is a thing whether you’re an in-person or satellite viewer—this applies to mental energy, too. “If you’re ever stressed or tired, watch a documentary to reset yourself,” says <b>Jim Cummings</b>, writer and director, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ddue\">Thunder Road</a></i> short (Grand Jury winner, Sundance 2016), producer, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiMY\">Beast Beast</a></i> (Sundance 2020).</p><p>And, given it’s a seven-day-long haul, feel free to throw cooking plans out the window and follow the Park City diet, in which you “eat nothing but finger foods for the duration of the festival,” according to Moss and McBaine. Or, as <b>Ekwa Msangi</b>, writer-director of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oinE\">Farewell Amor</a></i> (Sundance 2020) recommends, “get some deliciously flavored popcorn and a hot drink for afterwards!”</p><p>Another at-home tip from Corry: “Don’t turn the lights on when you get up to go to the bathroom mid-movie, so as to recreate the sensation of your eyes struggling to adjust to the light in the restroom.”</p><!--figure[4]--><h2>Hell is other people (but animals are cool).</h2><p>Not all of us live alone, and not all of us live with film lovers. Company is welcome, interruptions are to be expected, but do set some boundaries and decide what you will and won’t compromise on. “If you’ve got to bargain with roommates and family members for your turn to use the TV, be intentional about sound!” advises Letterboxd contributor, <b>Selome Hailu</b>. “Don’t compromise on music documentaries or well-scored horror, but rom-com dialogue might still sound okay with your laptop speaker.”</p><p>Housemates not human? That’s no problem for <b>Alexis Gambis</b>, writer, director and co-editor, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/srQy\"><i>Son of Monarchs</i></a> (Sundance 2021): “Make room for your pets, let them be the film critics this time around.”</p><p>Importantly, says Cummings, “Be kind to everyone.” Whether you’re at a satellite screening, joining a festival event online or talking about the films on your social channels, “everyone is here to watch crazy weird movies. Remind yourself that it’s all about weird cinema and the creators. Watch movies!”</p><p>“And definitely stay for the Q&amp;As,” say Moss and McBaine. “Always incredible.”</p><!--figure[5]--><h2>Watch the premieres as their makers intended.</h2><p>Look, filmmakers know what they’re up against in 2021, but it doesn’t stop them dreaming big when it comes to how we see their films for the first time. <b>Sara Hirner</b> and <b>Rosemary Vasquez-Brown</b>, directors of the Sundance 2021 short <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/qyW0\">GNT</a></i>, have put some thought into this:</p><p>“We demand that <i>GNT</i> be viewed in one of two very specific ways, and since we have no control over ourselves or the world at large, we urge you to at least pay us this small kindness!</p><p>Option A: You shall view <i>GNT</i> at 3:00am, <i>sans</i> pants, with two-day-old pizza and your laptop perched on your titties.</p><p>Option B: You shall dress in your finest garb, slather your face in makeup (please consult the swaths of teenage beauty gurus if you’re unsure on how to accomplish this task), and adorn yourself in your highest heels. These must all be the same color (tone variations will be accepted). Crack open your cheapest available sparkling wine and get to it. We hope you enjoy the show.”</p><p>For those whose Sundance dress code extends only to bed-wear, Msangi pleads: “If you’re staying in your pajamas, at least put on a cool beanie to spice things up!”</p><!--figure[6]--><h2>Tweets, or it didn’t happen.</h2><p>Finally, and most essentially, <b>Aneesh Chaganty</b>, writer and director of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hDPg\"><i>Searching</i></a> (Sundance 2018), declares: “It’s not a Sundance hit without insane amounts of buzz. If you like it, tell everyone you know.”</p><p>After all, it’s what we’re here for… isn’t it? The last word goes to <b>Joe Talbot</b>, co-writer and director of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/iWAw\">The Last Black Man in San Francisco</a></i> (Sundance 2019): “Since so many people at Sundance like to say that, between all the meetings and panels, they just haven’t had a chance to see any movies, let 2021 be the year that if you haven’t seen the movies, you admit it’s because you just don’t like movies.” Boom.</p>"

Over the past two decades, we’ve seen him seem forge a thrillingly chameleonic, unpredictable path that’s included an ecological thriller (<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ogU\">Charisma</a></i>), an Ozu-esque family drama (<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ZxQ\">Tokyo Sonata</a></i>), a metaphysical romance (<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/b3D2\">Journey to the Shore</a></i>) and an alien invasion sci-fi (<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/fSUQ\">Before We Vanish</a></i>). No one is really doing it like Kurosawa, and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jEUA\">To the Ends of the Earth</a></i> is arguably his most exciting and enigmatic left-turn yet.</p><p><i>To the Ends of the Earth</i> is a commissioned piece to celebrate the diplomatic relations between Japan and the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, but that doesn’t diminish that it’s unmistakably a Kiyoshi Kurosawa film, not a tossed-off, exoticized, postcard-pretty travelogue. His signature languorous pacing, shrewdly slippery tonal calibration, and acute spatial sensitivity are at full bore, servicing a loosely plotted tale of TV travel show host Yoko (former J-pop singer Atsuko Maeda) and her crew attempting to complete shooting an episode in the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent.</p><p>If anything, this movie should really confirm him as a filmmaker of bold, fictive playfulness in a comparable register to Jacques Rivette, Olivier Assayas and Christian Petzold—something that 2013’s hour-long, similarly fish-out-of-water head-rush <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/7kC8\">Seventh Code</a></i>, also starring Maeda, hinted at. In <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i>, gentleness, compassion and dream-like bursts of song and fantasy percolate through a disquieting maze of displacement—cultural, artistic, gendered—and the result is an adventurous, unpindownable, thoroughly humanistic work of curiosity and imagination.</p><p><b>Some years ago you did a “double feature”-themed interview with the Belfort Entrevues Film Festival where you revealed the sources of inspiration for some of your films. What film, if any, was a chief influence for <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i>, and can you tell us in what way?<br/></b><i>Kiyoshi Kurosawa:</i> When I make my work, I often consciously refer to films from the past, but that’s usually the case with genre films. For example, <i>Cure</i> was greatly inspired by <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aHW\">The Silence of the Lambs</a></i>. However, <i>To the Ends of the Eart</i>h is not a genre movie, so I wasn’t consciously thinking of any specific films. However, the composition of the story, that the main character appears in every scene, is based on films by the Dardenne brothers. Viewing their films <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TJm\">The Child</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/6A58\">Two Days, One Night</a></i>, it’s clear to see how the depiction of just one person can turn trivial incidents into something serious and suspenseful.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Watching <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1sXw\">Bright Future</a></i>, <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/dfd0\">Creepy</a></i> back-to-back recently, I noticed several parallels and motifs which may or may not be intentional. For example, a jellyfish makes an appearance in a scene on TV in <i>Creepy</i>, or there’s a TV report of a blaze in <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i> that momentarily hints at a bigger natural catastrophe that echoes the jellyfish swarm in <i>Bright Future</i>, or other apocalyptic moments in your films like <i>Charisma</i> and <i>Before We Vanish</i>. Do you find that some of these motifs work on a subconscious level for you, or were some of them intentionally threaded in?<br/></b>It’s a very interesting point. Some of them were intentional and some were not at all. It’s true about jellyfish, they appear in both <i>Bright Future</i> and <i>Creepy</i>. However, this is the first time I’ve noticed. The endings of <i>Charisma</i> and <i>Before We Vanish</i> were already written in the script by necessity, so of course, it’s intentional. The depiction of the blaze on TV in <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i> was introduced to show something happening in Japan while the main character is taking a small adventure in Uzbekistan. I wanted to show that her boyfriend was in some kind of crisis there. While the fire on the TV is merely an accident, it does appear apocalyptic. I may have overdone that a bit. Perhaps some kind of unconscious thinking was at work.</p><p><b>That amusement park ride scene in <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i> has stayed with me in the way it suggests terror out of something seemingly mundane. What are some scenes from other films that have stayed with you?<br/></b>The amusement park ride scene wasn’t introduced to express terror. What I wanted to show was how crazy the assignment is and Yuko’s professionalism.  She takes on the assignment without fear. This may have been a bit overdone as well. However, I thought that Atsuko Maeda, who didn’t hesitate to actually ride it three times, was a real professional. Apart from that, if I think about the movies that force people to experience horror, what comes to me are Roger Corman’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1prM\">Pit and the Pendulum</a></i>. Tobe Hooper’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1PUK\">The Funhouse</a></i>, George Miller’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2DjO\">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></i>. I also remembered the episode in Freddie Francis’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/10kQ\">Torture Garden</a></i>, where a grand piano has a will to kill people, which was great.</p><p><b>Your films tend to be very location-based; environments and spaces appear to play a significant part. The pandemic has been the ultimate test of our relationship with spaces and each other. How has the pandemic impacted you as a filmmaker, and are there themes and ideas that you are interested in exploring further as a result of Covid?<br/></b>As you pointed out, when I make a movie, I pay great attention to the location. The moment I find a good location, I feel that the script will be transformed into a movie. It is the moment when fiction and reality are fused. It’s hard to say anything though, I haven’t made a movie since the pandemic started. What I can say, at least, is that sitting in front of the computer at home is not cinematic at all. So far, I don’t feel that something new will be born from it. What should I do? After all, I feel that a movie can only be made by going out in the city with a camera after utilizing the best epidemic prevention system possible.</p><p><b>If you had to pick a film that’s a personal favorite, which would you pick, and why?<br/></b>It&rsquo;s too difficult a question. Japanese movies and foreign movies have different viewpoints. Also, there are completely different categories of movies [that] greatly influence me when I make films and the movies I saw when I was young that make me nostalgic. It’s impossible to choose just one. But, well, the one that comes to mind is Sam Peckinpah’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1zmM\">The Ballad of Cable Hogue</a></i>, which is both nostalgic and heavily influential for me.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>You’ve spoken about your fondness for American filmmakers like Tobe Hooper, Robert Aldrich, Steven Spielberg <i>et al</i>. Are there new, or more recent American filmmakers and films that have caught your attention or that you’re particularly excited by?<br/></b>I don’t know much about young American directors, but what I always care about is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/alfonso-cuaron/\">Alfonso Cuarón</a>. Of course he is not a new, young filmmaker, but an auteur. Also, since this is a good opportunity, I’d like to mention <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/robert-zemeckis/\">Robert Zemeckis</a>. He made such masterpieces as <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/20i8\">Cast Away</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/26v8\">What Lies Beneath</a></i> around 2000. For some reason, he has never been properly evaluated at all. For a time he was devoted to animation. However, he made a spectacular return to live-action films with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/35Ca\">Flight</a></i> and continues to shoot unique masterpieces like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/cP42\">Allied</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/bNBQ\">Welcome to Marwen</a></i>. Of course, not many people appreciate these works. However, he does not seem to care about public opinion at all and continues to boldly shoot new works. Perhaps Zemeckis is the American film director who makes the most authentic films today.</p><p><b>What are your movie-watching habits like? Do you continue to watch movies on physical media or prefer streaming these days? What was the last movie you saw in a theater?<br/></b>Basically, I like to watch movies at an ordinary movie theater in the city the most. When I can’t go to the movie theater, or even though I know the film is going to be boring but I have to watch a movie for business, I have no choice but to watch it on DVD or Blu-ray. Of course, I also use VOD once in a while. The last movie I saw in the theater, as of today, was the Japanese film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/qUzC\">The Voice in the Crime</a></i>. I saw that just yesterday. I saw it with my wife at a cinema complex in Shinjuku, Tokyo. It was the latest work by the director who made the previous masterpiece <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/bJVW\">Flying Colors</a></i>, and I expected much from it. It was speedy and quite well done until the middle of the film, but by the ending, it was too boring. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a good movie.</p><p><b>What’s a memorable film-related moment from your childhood, perhaps something you experienced with family or friends, or a film that scared you or made you cry?<br/></b>The movies that my generation often watched growing up were mainly monster movies. The most unforgettable one was <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/zka\">Matango</a></i>. Like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/28kc\">Godzilla</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/13K8\">Mothra</a></i>, it was directed by Ishirō Honda. I went to see this movie with my friends. It had a rather cute touch in the promotional materials depicting a mushroom with a monstrous appearance. However, the content was completely different from a normal monster movie. Shipwrecked survivors on an uninhabited island encounter monstrous mushroom creatures washed up on the shore. These are not unknown creatures such as <i>Godzilla</i> or <i>Mothra</i>, but the horrifying ending of a human being. The characters are being infected, changing one another into mushroom humans. All of us children trembled from the bottom of our hearts. In retrospect, the work is an extreme horror aiming along the same line as [Howard Hawks and] Christian Nyby’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Vp4\">The Thing from Another World</a></i>. It was probably the first time I encountered horror which was not “to escape from destruction” but “when a human being becomes something not human”.</p><p><b>Is there a filmmaker or film you think about a lot that you don’t get to talk about much and would like to show some appreciation?<br/></b>I haven’t talked much about the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-yakuza-papers-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Battles Without Honor and Humanity</i> series</a> directed by Kinji Fukasaku. I don’t know how well this series of Japanese movies is known abroad, but when I was a high-school student I saw this and quickly became a big fan. I’ve watched a variety of yakuza movies since then, and it’s safe to say that nothing beats this series. As the title suggests, the films depict a yakuza world without “Jingi” (yakuza’s moral code), and it was really humorous and exciting to see the betrayals and the destruction. After I saw this, all those traditional yakuza movies dominated by the strange ideology of “Jingi” looked like a childish fantasy.</p>"

He was pitched the role by director Simon West, known for action spectacles <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28gO\"><i>Con Air</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/27G2\"><i>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</i></a>, and was immediately on board. He is the only white guy in the film’s cast, and one of its few primarily English-speaking performers (lead actress Hannah Quinlivan is Taiwanese-Australian).</p><p>It’s the kind of CGI-heavy hot mess that’s best experienced in cinemas; <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1t5zXL\">as Todd Gaines remarks</a>, “this disaster movie is something you would expect to see at the movies while you are eating your weight in popcorn and other tasty snacks.” Nevertheless, the high melodrama, hot lava, fire rocks and snappy 90-minute run time is like catnip to action lovers stuck at home.</p><p><b>What enticed you to a shoot that was so far from home?<br/></b><i>Jason Isaacs:</i> Yeah, it was in Malaysia—I was enticed because it was Simon West. [He] had offered me a job a year or two beforehand that I wasn’t able to do, then he called up saying he was doing a Chinese disaster movie and it was impossible to say no. If there’s anybody who is a master at orchestrating gigantic set pieces, it’s Simon. He does it so calmly and he was a pleasure to be around. Plus, apart from the fact that I knew it would be fun, the peripheral pleasure I get from work is that I get to go to new places and meet new people. This was an entirely different culture of filmmaking, but also a different universe of engaging with human beings.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Which entrepreneurs or fictional characters did you base your character Jack Harris on?<br/></b>He’s part Richard Attenborough [in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aA2\"><i>Jurassic Park</i></a>] because I’ve built a resort in a place that the scientists tell me will probably be safe, and luckily for the audience it all goes horribly wrong quite quickly. Then also part Elon Musk because he’s slightly flashy and attention-seeking, and I gave him a South African accent just for a laugh. Though that was at the point when I knew Musk was South African but didn’t know that Musk had very successfully buried and hidden his South African accent a long time ago. I like action movies—they take me away from myself. Maybe I wanted to say something about technology and what we’re doing to the planet. Who are the people making giant strides in our name, and are they really strides?</p><p><b>It’s a painful irony that a natural disaster disrupted the film’s release. It’s gone from escapism to unfortunately relevant, and your character’s hubris is reflected in the denial and selfishness we’re now seeing every day—do we never learn from movies?<br/></b>I have to say the answer is probably no, not directly in a way we can correlate. One of the reasons we might learn from movies is because no-one trusts facts anymore. If you can’t persuade the population to source their data properly and be able to sift between the nonsense, then maybe fiction can inspire people. I think sci-fi, fantasy and adventure is an easier way to touch people morally and get them to help frame their ethical universe. So whether it’s <i>Star Trek</i> or <i>Star Wars</i> [Isaacs appears in the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/\"><i>Star Trek: Discovery</i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2930604/\"><i>Star Wars Rebels</i></a> television series] or exploding volcanoes, we find it easier to identify with the moral choices than we do when it’s set where we live, because all of our partisan biases kick in.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Playing villains, antagonists and fiends is largely your forté, of course. How has your understanding of the “baddie” psyche evolved over the years?<br/></b>Yes, of course, I’ve played antagonists—I’d be a fool to pretend they aren’t written to be that—but I try to take parts only where I can find three dimensions in them. Where they can look in the mirror and think they’re doing the right thing. The man who no longer occupies the White House thought he was doing the right thing sending a mob crashing into Congress, which ended up with people dying. He doesn’t think of himself as a villain, he thinks of himself as a white savior—or whatever it is—and that he’s being outdone and robbed by everyone else.</p><p>I played a soldier with PTSD very early on in my career and I learned that you can’t do a decent job with a camera pointed at you if you’re not inside their head and living with the choices they make. Sometimes people know that they’re doing the wrong thing and think they can justify it because they think everyone else is doing the wrong thing and they should do it before others. Nobody ever does the wrong thing and knows it is, and certainly if you do, the character should too, and have to wrestle with it. I studied law originally before I studied acting and I think that insists that you see the both sides to every argument.</p><p><b>I watch the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/harry-potter-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Harry Potter</i> series</a> every year—I have a very fond memory of seeing your franchise debut in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29QI\"><i>Chamber of Secrets</i></a> for my tenth birthday—and its depiction of a dangerous fascism coming from past to present becomes more potent each viewing. How has <i>Harry Potter</i>’s importance unfolded for you since its conclusion?<br/></b>For me, I’ve understood more about storytelling—not how to do it, but understanding the power and profundity of how much it can affect people. I’ve been lucky enough to go do <i>Harry Potter</i>-y things over the last ten years and when I meet fans at conventions, they don’t want to talk about the costumes or what you were like in it, people want to tell you about important periods of their life and how these characters’ journeys helped them out of the dark. They’re often life rafts in very choppy seas and the power of storytelling to change people’s lives has been a real eye-opener for me. It’s made me believe often in storytelling again in ways that other jobs can make me cynical about.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Let’s move on to your life in film. Who gives the ultimate villain performance for you?<br/></b>Well, it’s Alan [Rickman]. It’s always Alan, when he wants to be a villain. It could either be the Sheriff of Nottingham [in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20hu\"><i>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i></a>] or it could be Hans Gruber in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a7u\"><i>Die Hard</i></a>. Tony Hopkins chewing up the scenery in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aHW\"><i>The Silence of the Lambs</i></a>, Gary [Oldman] in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/71k\"><i>The Fifth Element</i></a>, Jack Nicholson in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Nu\"><i>The Shining</i></a>—is that a villain performance? It’s when the script gives the villain all the power, or even when the villain wins, when the performance makes sense to me.</p><p><b>What are your go-to comfort movies, that you will watch anytime, anywhere?<br/></b>I cannot switch off <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aNK\">The Godfather</a>,</i> no matter what frame it’s on. Sometimes it’ll be really inappropriate where I really ought to go to bed because I’ll be picked up in a few hours and there we are, we’re in Sicily. I have an eighteen-year-old and a fifteen-year-old and since the first day of lockdown we cannot agree on what we want to watch, ever. We were arguing about what to watch on Christmas Day, and while we were talking, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1MLK\"><i>The Sound of Music</i></a> was on telly. When we finally came to an agreement, we all just looked at each other and instinctively went, “shall we just leave this on?” So we kept watching <i>The Sound of Music</i>, which was utterly brilliant.</p><p>Instead of the “comfort food” of watching the same films over and over again, what I really like is watching films from brand new filmmakers where I don’t know anybody in it. I’m in a very privileged position of being on the British Independent Film Awards board, so I get to see all the independent films every year. The greatest experiences I’ve ever had in a cinema have always been when I’ve not known what’s about to happen. I remember seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/14FI\"><i>Winter’s Bone</i></a> before knowing Jennifer [Lawrence] and Debra Granik and being taken somewhere else. I remember seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Omi\"><i>You Can Count on Me</i></a>, Kenny Lonergan’s first film, and feeling the same thing.</p><p><b>What’s your fondest memory of seeing a film in the cinema?<br/></b>My mum took me to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aLk\"><i>Live and Let Die</i></a> and I can’t for the life of me remember the context, but I do remember that we weren’t meant to go. She looked at me very mischievously and said “Shall we go to the movies and see the latest Bond film?” It felt illicit.</p><p>The most vivid memory I have of watching a film was at the Scala that Stephen Woolley used to run in King’s Cross, which was an absolute pit of a cinema—no cushions in the seats, everything sticky with beer. They would have all-nighters with themed films and one time [I attended when] they showed <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1a3q\"><i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i></a> with a bunch of other things. Then after midnight, when everybody at that stage was either drunk or high or both, on came <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UOs\">This is Spinal Tap</a>.</i> Nobody had heard of it and didn’t know that it would be a parody. We just doubled over, the rows were running with urine. Nobody had ever seen anything so funny. I’m not sure that we knew it was a deliberate joke but it was one of the greatest cinema memories of my life.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>Do you have a favorite film that came out in 2020?<br/></b>There’s loads. I thought <a href=\"https://boxd.it/l8Qg\"><i>Rocks</i></a>, Sarah Gavron’s film, and Phyllida Lloyd’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiMO\"><i>Herself</i></a> were great. I liked <a href=\"https://boxd.it/r5O4\"><i>Host</i></a>, which is a Zoom horror film that is fantastic. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/l8Qq\"><i>His House</i></a> was great, which you can see on Netflix at the moment. I just saw Tom Hanks in Paul Greengrass’s very lovely, elegiac, ‘really-should-be-seen-on-a-wide-screen’ <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lm7a\"><i>News of the World</i></a>. I inhale films and there were just so many great storytellers telling so many great stories.</p><p>I don’t get the big screen downstairs very often. My children watch TV shows—we’ve been watching <i>Schitt’s Creek</i> lately—and they don’t have the attention span for films, but when we do we watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1RHI\"><i>The Big Chill</i></a><i>.</i> That’s a film I’ve watched 300 times! We watched <i>The Big Chill</i> the other day and it held them all from beginning to end. It hasn’t dated a second.</p>"

There is hope that by finding it on Netflix, the film will reach a broad, worldwide audience, who will see themselves in the love and loss that propels the film, and recognize the hope and heartbreak of their own lives.</p><p><b>Why did you start the film with a shot of Sean, not Martha?<br/></b><i>Kornél Mundruczó:</i> It was important to start on the bridge with Sean, as we later finish on the bridge with Martha. It creates a sense of curiosity and suspense. Who is Martha? And I love the sentence there that Sean says when he goes, “Martha is always fine”.</p><p><i>Kata Wéber:</i> I really wanted to start with that line in the script, because then you’ll see that Martha isn’t actually always fine. It’s asking what she has to live up to, the picture of perfect Martha. Later on, you understand why it’s so important what she has to go through.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Martha has to go through so much in that incredible 22-minute take of her giving birth. How did that scene come to be, and which of you came up with the idea first?<br/></b><i>KM:</i> It was my idea, but it was not a quick idea. When you read 35 pages about birth—an experience which is amazingly personal and shows a variety of emotions—you wonder how you can do that. The main thing was wondering about using a handheld camera because it gives a lot of opportunity, but at the same time I found it to be too personal, and it’s very much like dogma filmmaking. And then a distant camera felt too manipulative and cold, so we found a tool called a gimbal, which is not really a filmmaking tool. It’s used more for sports and music videos. But we felt it was very spiritual, which helped us represent the spirit which needed to be there. Like an unseen spirit, which is always inside births.</p><p>I have real problems with cutting, and telling the time of a fourteen-hour story. It didn’t feel like the right choice, because we’re not a documentary, but it didn’t feel like you had Martha’s physical presence if you were cutting it. So, how could we grow her physical presence? So we expanded the film time, and we compressed into that expanded film time a compressed real time. And then it works. It felt like a manifesto for me, like a monolith. It represents Martha’s inner journey but also every single person can feel connected to that. It was a long research process to find the perfect form, but then we shot it on the first day.</p><p><b>Was there anything you were worried about for the viewer, when deciding to begin the film with that scene?<br/></b><i>KM:</i> I decided to start the film with that scene because I was worried about the whole movie! I felt that you can’t play it without this kind of experience. I never really felt that I wanted to do a movie, I was trying to say without words that I wanted to create more of an experience, an emotional journey. And later, when Martin Scorsese became a producer, he was the one who called me after watching it for the first time and said, “This is not a movie, it’s an experience”. I’d never named it before then, but had always wanted to do that. So it was important to just jump into the deepest point of the emotional journey.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Vanessa Kirby has said the film responds to the fact that we’re so used to seeing death in cinema, and yet we capture birth on film so little. Was that something you were conscious about when making the film, or was your story always more personal?<br/></b><i>KW:</i> Because it was first a play, there was already the question about how you’d do a birth scene on stage, which is even trickier than on film. But if you don’t do it, the whole story doesn’t make sense because you don’t establish this loving relationship—not just within the couple, but towards the baby. So I really wanted to stand for this scene. I wrote it long, because when you give birth there is this huge beauty and grace and love, and a certain kind of horror too. It’s uncontrolled and so spiritual.</p><p><i>KM:</i> When I read the script it was shockingly personal, but also I thought that this really isn’t an academic movie. The structure is very special, it’s really not a dogmatic arthouse approach, which I did quite a few of! It’s not commercial either, so we thought, what is this? I didn’t know, but knew that I wanted to tell this story. Am I able to create a birth scene, which is kind of a taboo? Am I able to create a very emotional movie in a realistic sense? Which also feels like a form of taboo. I like the experience of exploring new fields and giving an audience something that is not just a movie.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>What were your different reference points for Martha’s different chapters in the film? Her journey is so unconventional and Vanessa’s performance feels like it taps into so many different emotions.<br/></b><i>KW:</i> It’s about the inner journey of someone, so you want to make sure she knows all the aspects of this state of mind. We talked about bereavement processes where grief doesn’t go through the typical five stages, but it’s just stuck somewhere. What is grieving? If you talk to a psychiatrist they could often say that there is no recipe. It could be you waking up at four in the morning wanting to bake a cake. That’s grieving. We tried to establish it as authentic as possible.</p><p><i>KM:</i> There’s a hundred layers to Martha. Even in the birth, there’s thirty stages that she has to go through.</p><p><i>KW:</i> And she had to understand how physical it is. Giving birth is so physical, but also grieving is not intellectual. You cannot figure out how to do it.</p><p><i>KM:</i> It’s also our personal experience, as we had a miscarriage. But when I read the script, I still didn’t know grief was so physical. It’s such a special perspective, because if you are not in it, you have the pain but you don’t have this kind of physical longing. That’s why we talked to Vanessa so much about her silence and her body as being way more important than any acting skills. The most important thing was to feel it. In her nail polish, her body language, her walking, how she smokes. That was so much more important for me as a director than the big speech. And of course the big speech matters, but all the other details are the character.</p><p><b>I want to talk about the significance of the apples. Martha says it’s the way baby Yvette smells when she was born, and there’s a lot of symbolism in the idea of a growing seed. But does that fruit in particular have any significance for you?<br/></b><i>KW:</i> I was trying to find something expressing her longing and love to her baby. I didn’t know what it could be at first, but when my baby was born, she smelled like an apple and it was so surprising. It’s so weird and beautiful and nice, and I’ll never forget it. It’s so hard to express the inner journey and the longing and the love without words—I really wanted to try and convey that.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>What do you think Letterboxd members should watch after <i>Pieces of a Woman</i>?<br/></b><i>KM:</i> I’m a fan of early Michelangelo Antonioni movies, like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ttW\"><i>Red Desert</i></a> or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/10iU\"><i>La Notte</i></a>. I think those intellectual melodramas are very healing.</p><p><b>What is a film that always breaks your heart?<br/></b><i>KM:</i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aRi\"><i>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</i></a>, by Rainer Werner Fassbinder.</p><p><i>KW:</i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1myg\"><i>A Woman Under the Influence</i></a> for me. It’s close to something we’re trying to understand here.</p><p><b>And what about when you want to piece it back together?<br/></b><i>KM:</i> For me it’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1DkK\"><i>Late Spring</i></a> by Yasujirō Ozu.</p><p><i>KW:</i> I was just thinking the same! Someone peels an apple in that movie…</p><p><b>Finally, what films made you want to be filmmakers?<br/></b><i>KM:</i> I grew up in the Soviet area watching a lot of movies in my childhood by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/elem-klimov/\">Elem Klimov</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/aleksey-german-1/\">Aleksey German</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/andrei-tarkovsky/\">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>. These movies are socially reflective but also very emotional and spiritual, very transcendental. And those transcendental acts feel almost forgotten now, and that’s a bit painful. Even contemporary Russian movies are not so deeply transcendental. The images from those movies really stayed with me—I mean, I’m from the East!</p><p><i>KW:</i> For me it’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/18Im\"><i>The Graduate</i></a>. It’s just so much about life. It’s funny and witty, I just love it. I could watch it 100 times and I would never get bored.</p>"

If we were to reflect on cinema’s history, few filmmakers have the breadth of experience and foresight as Oliveira. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4chg\">His first film</a> was made in the silent era using a hand-cranked camera. By the time of his death at 106 years of age, he had made dozens of movies, including many in a digital format.</p><p>He made<i> Visit, or Memories and Confessions</i> in the shadow of the Portuguese dictatorship. While filming, he imagined he was in the twilight of his life. It revisited essential incidents in his history but also that of his country. It’s a film of reconciliation, violence and oppression, told tenderly in a home lost as a consequence of a vindictive dictatorship. Oliveira’s film, like his life, spanned time in a way that stretches perceptions. It’s a film without significant incident, about the peaceful pleasures and tragedies of daily life.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>What worlds have changed over the past one hundred years? The same breadth of perception, which often feels too seismic to tackle in traditional narrative cinema, was also explored in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-time-that-remains/\"><i>The Time that Remains</i></a>. In a retelling of his family’s history, Palestinian filmmaker <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/elia-suleiman/\">Elia Suleiman</a> also tells Israel’s story. It is a film of wry comparisons and Keatonesque comic patterns. As borders change and time passes, few things fundamentally change, except on a spiritual plane. What happens to people without an identity or a country? What damage does it do to their souls?</p><p>The question of time looms heavily in both Oliveira’s and Suleiman’s films. They are movies that contemplate centuries of experiences and explore how those stories are guarded, twisted and erased by the powerful.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>The echoes of history and attempts to break with old patterns often emerge in other anti-colonial and anti-imperialist films. They can be seen in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/alanis-obomsawin/\">Alanis Obomsawin</a>’s vital and angry <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/7vaY\">Incident at Restigouche</a></i>, about an explosive, centuries-in-the-making 1981 conflict between Quebec provincial police and the First Nations people of the Restigouche reserve; In<i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1EII\">Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India</a></i>, villagers must win a cricket match to free themselves from involuntary servitude; and in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2dkw\">Daughters of the Dust</a></i>, the languid pace of the Gullah culture is challenged by the promise and violence of the American mainland.</p><p>Time, more than just a tool for chronology, becomes in itself a tool for oppression. Those who control time maintain power. If we are to break with dominant histories, the rhythms of oppression must be broken and challenged.</p><!--figure[4]--><blockquote><p>“The universe is pregnant with inertia and has given birth to time.” —Forugh Farrokhzad, <i>The House is Black</i></p></blockquote><p>Persian filmmaker and poet Forugh Farrokhzad made just one film before her untimely death in a car accident when she was 32. <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/STe\">The House is Black</a></i> is a short documentary about a Leper colony, which utilizes essay-esque prose taken from the Quaran, and Farrokhzad’s poetry. It is a film about people who are seen as invisible by society at large, cast away and hidden. The film reflects on beauty, sickness and reconciliation. How does one experience time when you’ve been ostracized and cut off from the larger world?</p><p>Barbara Loden’s landmark independent film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2OjK\">Wanda</a></i> asks a similar question. A solo mother who cycles from one abusive situation to the next exists outside of time and space. She is invisible. If we look at most American cinema, it might as well be propelled by people who take control over their destiny, but what of the people who are (un)willingly passive to the whims of society and other human beings? In her powerlessness, Wanda stands in for the invisible labor and sacrifices of so many other women. The ordinariness of Wanda’s life, the dusty and dirty environments she inhabits, rebound with significance. It is, however, not a victorious film. Instead, it is a profound portrait of loss and beauty. It’s the only film Barbara Loden ever made.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want anything you won&rsquo;t have anything, and if you don&rsquo;t have anything, you&rsquo;re as good as dead.&rdquo; —Norman Dennis in <i>Wanda</i></p></blockquote><!--figure[5]--><p>In 2020, it seemed all we had was time. What seemed like an opportunity quickly became horrific. Time became a burden. We were reminded of our finite time on this Earth and all the hours spent commuting, working and surviving. The pandemic has had a seismic impact on our perceptions. In processing the ongoing crisis, we’ve transformed our relationship to the passage of time. We’ve altered the state of our reality.</p><p>This new pandemic gaze offers us new perspectives on time and history. The oldest film on the list is Erich Von Stroheim’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blind-husbands/\">Blind Husbands</a></i>, released in 1919 during the grips of the Spanish flu. The film does not reference the event, but its sensuality and class conflicts speak to a world on the brink of seismic change. It is a movie about an Austrian military officer who seduces a surgeon’s wife. The men grapple with jealousy and violence on a literal mountaintop, fighting for survival in an increasingly mechanized society.</p><!--figure[6]--><p>To this day, <i>Blind Husbands</i> is shocking. It’s profoundly fetishistic and loaded with heavy sexual imagery. It’s a movie about touch and desire absent of love and affection. It speaks to aspects of current life that feel lost and impenetrable. It speaks to growing and changing social disparities as well. Surviving the modern world is more than just surviving the plague; it has to do with value compromises and shifting power dynamics.</p><p>But, a pandemic is also about loss. Gregg Araki’s 1992 film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-living-end/\"><i>The Living End</i></a>  explores the AIDS crisis from the inside out. Rebellious and angry, the film is about a gay hustler and a movie critic, both of whom have been diagnosed with the HIV virus. With characters who are cast out from society at large, gripped with a deadly and unknown fate, <i>The Living End</i> is apocalyptic—much like other Araki works from the 90s, such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-doom-generation/\"><i>The Doom Generation</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/totally-fucked-up/\"><i>Totally Fucked Up</i></a>. It captures the deep sense of hopelessness of experiencing a pandemic while also belonging to a marginalized group. What is so radical about Araki’s cinema, though, is that it is also fun. It is a film that transcends mourning and becomes a lavish punk celebration. It is a film about survival, out of step with dominant ideology and histories.</p><!--figure[7]--><p>The connections between <i>Blind Husbands</i> and <i>The Living End</i> bridge together to form common passions and changing perceptions. Both films are products of their time, at once part of distant histories but also uncomfortably prescient. More than films about a specific time and place, they are transformed by the time we live in now. To watch and connect with these movies in a pandemic means looking and living beyond the current moment.</p><p>While it seems like cinema might be facing an especially precarious future, it feels like the ideal art form to process what is happening right now. Caught in the vicious patterns of our own creation, giving ourselves up to the rhythms of someone else’s will might be a necessary form of healing, as well as an ongoing project in compassion. Time does not have to be a prison; it can be an agent for liberation.</p>"

As large parts of the globe continued to lock down in April, we experienced the highest-ever number of logged views on our platform. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/letterboxd/status/1246004739772280833\">We watched <i>Paddington 2</i> together</a>. We <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/616064602011205632/touching-the-void\">sought comfort in films with white posters</a> and saw <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/622440787795410944/ghibli-goes-digital\">an explosion in Studio Ghibli activity</a>.</p><p>And then it was blockbuster season and… no blockbusters. Dates shifted, festivals went virtual, arthouse cinemas offered online viewings, <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/622585142487269376/halfway-2020\"><i>Bacurau</i> was the highest-rated film at the year’s halfway point</a>, films were bought and sold, streamers and cable channels stepped into the fray, Tom Cruise went off. And through it all, you watched movies. More of them than ever, more widely than before.</p><p>The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on your 2020 viewing habits are apparent: overall activity on the platform is up more than 90 percent year-on-year, and compared with past years—where the split of films watched from the year in question versus any other year has traditionally been above 20 percent—films released in 2020 represented just 11.8 percent of those logged last year.</p><p>But what we noticed most was this: a significant leap in activity around international and independent films, alongside comfort rewatches and first-time watches of classics. As our worlds contracted, you took the time to expand your cinematic horizons. The Year in Review holds the evidence, with many global and independent voices making the cut in various categories.</p><p>For the first time in Letterboxd Year in Review history, the three top films are written and directed (or co-directed) by artists of color. In 2020, a record sixteen women directors appear in Letterboxd’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/aFht8\">50 highest-rated films overall</a> (up six from last year). This year, we also highlight the work of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) directors: a pleasing 22 films from the top 50 (including four from Steve McQueen) are from directors of color. What’s encouraging is that this feels like a permanent shift in viewing habits. We couldn’t be prouder.</p><p>The vaccine is hope, but we’re a long way from normal. If there’s one thing that the top three films have in common—apart from their singular, spectacular artistry—it’s a reminder that community is everything, and we can’t do this without each other.</p><p>For our part, we remain committed to supporting the industry in their remarkable efforts to bring films to you however they can. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/members/hq/\">Our new HQ tier</a> is one such tool, enabling festivals, cinemas, distributors and other film-centric organizations to participate directly with the Letterboxd community; another is our new watchlist notification feature for Pro and Patron members, which lets you know when a film lands on a service you subscribe to.</p><p>And we, like you, are amped to get back into cinemas when it’s safe. Until then, let’s keep embracing movies, wherever we can see them. Because in them, we can see each other. 🥰</p><p>Some important thank yous: to <a href=\"https://neonrated.com\">NEON</a> for partnering with us, to <a href=\"https://www.elenikalorkoti.com\">Eleni Kalorkoti</a> for 2020’s illustration, to <a href=\"https://mubi.com\">MUBI</a> for supporting our “wrapped” emails (coming your way in the next day or so), to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/\">Jack Moulton</a> for data deep-dives and list-making, to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/naturebean/\">Aaron Yap</a> for breakfast and dancing, to all the filmmakers for your essential storytelling work, and to all of you: thanks for hanging in there, and making our community the best bunch of film lovers on the internet.

She has helmed <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3QGS\">a documentary</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2seo\">a romantic drama</a>, both based on her own marriage; a 2008 short called <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jwOa\"><i>Take 3</i></a>, which preceded Hollywood’s current conversation about representation and harassment; and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fJI2\"><i>Do No Harm</i></a>, the splatter-tastic 2017 short in which her technical chops and fluid feel for action were on full display, and, as recorded in multiple Letterboxd reviews, established her as one to watch.</p><p><i>Do No Harm</i> scored Liang valuable Hollywood representation, whereupon producer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/brian-kavanaugh-jones/\">Brian Kavanaugh-Jones</a> brought <i>Shadow in the Cloud</i> to her, thinking she might connect with the material. “It did connect with me on a level that is very personal,” Liang tells me. “As a woman of color, as a mother who juggles a lot.” She says Kavanaugh-Jones then went through the process of removing original writer Max Landis from the project. “He felt that Max was not a good fit for this project, or for how we like to run things. We like to be respectful and courteous and kind to each other…”</p><p>In several interviews, Liang has said she’s comfortable with film lovers choosing not to watch <i>Shadow in the Cloud</i> based on Landis’s early involvement. What she’s <i>not</i> comfortable with is her own contribution—and that of her cast and crew—being erased. While WGA rules have his name attached firmly to the project, the credit belies the reality: his thin script, reportedly stretched out to 70 pages by using a larger-than-usual font, was expanded and deepened by Liang and her collaborators.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>That team includes editor Tom Eagles, Oscar nominated for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iEBG\"><i>Jojo Rabbit</i></a>, actor <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/nick-robinson-1/\">Nick Robinson</a> (the titular Simon in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/g02s\"><i>Love, Simon</i></a>) and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/beulah-koale/\">Beulah Koale</a>, a star of the <i>Hawaii Five-Oh</i> series. The opening newsreel was created by award-winning New Zealand animation studio Mukpuddy, after a small test audience got weirded out by the sight of a gremlin in a war film, despite well-documented WWI and WWII gremlin mythology. It’s an unnecessary but happy addition. The cartoon style was inspired by <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3tb8\"><i>Private Snafu</i></a>, a series of WWII educational cartoons scripted by none other than Dr. Seuss and directed by <i>Looney Tunes</i> legend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/chuck-jones-2/\">Chuck Jones</a>.</p><p>But the film ultimately hangs on Chloë Grace Moretz, who overcame cabin fever to drive home an adrenaline rush of screen craft, in which the very limits of what’s humanly possible in mid-air are tested (in ways, it must be said, that wouldn’t be questioned if it were Tom Cruise in the role). Liang would often send directions to Moretz’s ball turret via text, while her cast members delivered live dialogue from an off-set shipping container rigged with microphones. “I just never got sick of Chloë’s face and I’ve watched her hundreds, if not thousands of times. You feel her, you are her, she just engages you in a way that a huge fighting scene might not, if it’s not designed well. Giant empty spectacle is less interesting than one person in one spot, sometimes.”</p><p>Ambitious and nerdy about film in equal measure, it’s clear there’s much more to come from Liang, and I’m interested in what her most valuable lesson has been so far. Turns out, it’s a great story involving Chinese veteran <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/cheng-pei-pei-1/\">Cheng Pei-Pei</a> (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1uf2\"><i>Come Drink With Me</i></a>’s Golden Swallow, and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b1M\"><i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i></a>’s Jade Fox), whose film training includes a tradition of remaining on set throughout filming.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>That meant that, during filming of Liang’s <i>My Wedding and Other Secrets</i>, Cheng would stay on set when she wasn’t required. “In New Zealand, trailers are a luxury,” Liang explains. “I said ‘Don’t you want to go to the trailer that we arranged for you?’ ‘No, I just want to sit and watch.’ ‘Why do you want to watch it, you’ve seen it hundreds of times!’ And she said ‘I learn something new every time’. To Pei-Pei, the secret of life is constant education and curiosity and learning. Movies are her work and her craft and her life, and she never gets bored. If I can be like her, that’s the life, right?”</p><p>Speaking of which, it’s time we put Liang through our Life in Film interrogation.</p><p><b>What’s the film that made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aGY\">Terminator 2<i>: Judgment Day</i></a></i> is the movie that is at the top of the mountain that I’m climbing. To me it’s the perfect blend of spectacle, action design, smarts and heart. It poses the theory that if a robot can learn the value of humanity then maybe there’s hope for the ships that are us. That’s perennial, and possibly even more pertinent today. It holds a very special place in my heart, along with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29PA\">Aliens</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2DjO\">Mad Max: Fury Road</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a7u\">Die Hard</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YYm\">La Femme Nikita</a></i> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b8S\"><i>Léon: The Professional</i></a>.</p><p><b>What’s your earliest memory of watching a film?<br/></b>I have a cassette tape that my dad made for my grandma in 1981 (he’d send tapes back to his mother in Hong Kong). I was three years old and he had just taken us to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/27Vw\"><i>The Empire Strikes Back</i></a> in the cinema. And he can’t talk to my grandma because I’m just going on and on about R2-D2. I will not shut up about R2-D2 and he’s like, “Yes, yes I’m trying to talk to your grandmother,” and I’m like, “But Dad! Dad! R2-D2!” So it’s actually an archive, but it’s become my memory.</p><p><b>What’s the most romantic film you’ve ever seen?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/6YK\"><i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i></a>. It’s not the sexiest, but it’s the most romantic. That last scene, those last words where she goes “But you’re gonna be like this forever and I’m gonna be like this forever…” and he just goes “okay”. That to me is one of the most romantic scenes I’ve ever seen. It is a perfect movie.</p><p><b>And the scariest?<br/></b>If it’s a horror movie, the most scared I’ve been is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/26tw\"><i>The Ring</i></a>. I was watching it on a VHS and I was lying on a beanbag on the floor and I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t move, because I felt that if I moved she’d see me! Also, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Vs\"><i>American Psycho</i></a> just came to me this year. I caught the twentieth anniversary of that movie, which is a terrifying film, and again, possibly more relevant now than when it was made. The scariest film that’s not a horror is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/h4cS\"><i>Joker</i></a>. It scared me how much I liked it. When I came out of the movie, I was like, “I’m scared because I kind of love it, but it’s horrible. It’s so irresponsible. I don’t wanna like this movie but goddamn, I feel it.” Like, I wanted to go on the streets and rage. In a way we’re all the Joker, we’re all the Batman. That duality, that yin and yang, is inside everyone of us. It’s universal.</p><p><b>What is the film that slays you every time, leaving you in a heap of tears?<br/></b>This is a classic one, the opening sequence of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1OEc\"><i>Up</i></a>. The first ten minutes of <i>Up</i> just destroy me every time. I also saw <a href=\"https://boxd.it/ioLA\"><i>Soul</i></a> a couple of days ago and I was with the whole family and I, just, if I wasn’t with the whole family I would have been ugly-sobbing. I had a real ache in my throat after the movie because I was trying to stop [myself] from sobbing.</p><p><b>Tell me your favorite coming-of-age film, the film that first gave you ‘teenage feelings’?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/20aI\"><i>Pump Up the Volume</i></a>. Christian Slater! Off the back of <i>Pump Up the Volume</i>, I fancied myself as a prophet and wrote a theater piece called <i>Lemmings</i>. Obviously the main character was a person who could see through the façade, and everyone else was following norms. “No one understands me, I’m a prophet!” So clearly I have this shitty, <i>Joker</i>-style megalomaniac inside of me. It was the worst play, and I don’t know why my teachers agreed for us to do a staging of it!</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Is there a film that you and your family love to rewatch?<br/></b>We’ve tried to impose our taste on our children, but they’re too young. We showed them <a href=\"https://boxd.it/26EY\"><i>The Princess Bride</i></a>—they didn’t get it. We literally showed our babies <a href=\"https://boxd.it/72s\"><i>Star Wars</i></a> in their cribs. That’s how obsessive <i>Star Wars</i> fans we were.</p><p><b>Name a director and/or writer that you deeply admire for their use of the artform.<br/></b>I have a slightly weird answer for this. Can I just give love to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting\">Every Frame a Painting</a> by Tony Zhou and Taylor Ramos? They are my film school. I was thinking of my love of Edgar Wright, but then I thought of <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/96558506\">their video essay on Edgar Wright and how to film comedy</a>, and his essay on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ\">Jackie Chan and the rhythm of action</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UE3jz_O_EM\">their essay on the Coen Brothers and Shot Reverse Shot</a>. I must have watched that 30 times ahead of the TV show that I’m making now. I started out in editorial and Tony Zhou is an editor and he talks about when to make the cut: it’s an instinct, it’s a feeling, it’s a rhythm. I realized the one thing in common that I could mention about all the films I’ve loved is <i>Every Frame a Painting</i>. It’s their love of movies that comes bubbling out of every single essay that they made that I just wanna shout out at this part of my career.</p><p><b>Were there any crucial films that you turned to in your development for <i>Shadow in the Cloud</i>?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/indiana-jones-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">Indiana Jones</a></i> was something that Chloë brought up—she likes the spiffiness and the humor of Indiana Jones. Sarah Connor was our touchstone for the female character. For one-person-in-one-space type stories, I watched <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6hHC\"><i>Locke</i></a> quite a lot, to figure out how they shaped tension and story and [kept] us on the edge of our seats when it’s only one person in one space. In terms of superheroes, I came back to <i>Aliens</i>. Not <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2awY\"><i>Alien</i></a>. <i>Aliens</i>. You know, there are two types of people in this world—people who prefer <i>Alien</i> over <i>Aliens</i>, and people who prefer <i>Aliens</i> over <i>Alien</i>. But actually I think I vacillate for different reasons.</p><p><b>Can there be a third type of person, who thinks they’re both great, but <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20zS\"><i>Alien³</i></a>, just, no?<br/></b>Maybe that’s the best group to be in. We don’t need to fight about this, we can love both of them! I was having an argument with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/james-wan/\">James Wan</a>’s company about this, because there’s a rift inside the company of people who prefer <i>Alien</i> over <i>Aliens</i>.</p><p><b>Okay, program a triple feature with your film as one of the three.<br/></b>I don’t know. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/ant-timpson/\">Ask Ant Timpson</a>!</p><p><b>I’ll ask Ant Timpson.<br/></b>[We did, and he replied: “Well, one has to be the <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode with William Shatner: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/sKCK\"><i>Nightmare at 20,000 Feet</i></a>. And then either <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dRqG\"><i>Life</i></a> (2017) or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/Rmo\"><i>Altitude</i></a> (2010).”]</p><p>Thank you Ant! I used to go to his all-nighters as a university student. He is the king of programming things.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>It’s strange that we never met at one of his events! Ant would make me dress up in strange outfits and do weird skits between films. (For those who don’t know, Timpson ran the Incredibly Strange Film Festival for many years—now part of the New Zealand International Film Festival—and still runs an annual 24-Hour Movie Marathon.) So what’s a film from those events that sticks in your head as the perfect genre experience with a crowd?<br/></b>It was a movie about a man protecting a woman who was the girlfriend of a mafia boss: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1U4Y\"><i>A Bittersweet Life</i></a>. Not only does it have one of the sexiest Korean actors, sorry, not to objectify, but also I actually screenshot a lot of that film for pitch documents. And, do you remember a crazy Japanese movie where someone’s sitting on the floor with a clear umbrella and a woman is lactating milk? <a href=\"https://boxd.it/24DE\"><i>Visitor Q</i></a> by Takashi Miike. I remember just how fucking crazy that was.</p><p><b>Finally, what was the best film you saw in 2020?<br/></b>I haven’t seen <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnRy\"><i>Nomadland</i></a> yet, so keep in mind that I haven’t seen all the films this year. I have three: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kWlA\"><i>The Invisible Man</i></a>, which I thought was just amazing. I thought [writer-director] Leigh Whannell did such a great job. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/m0T4\"><i>The Half of It</i></a> by Alice Wu, a quiet movie that I simply just adored. And then the last movie I saw at the cinema was <a href=\"https://boxd.it/loRE\"><i>Promising Young Woman</i></a>. The hype is real.</p>"

How many bangers is a film allowed to have in our playlist? How will we choose between ‘Silly Games’ and ‘Kung Fu Fighting’ for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/qEAk\"><i>Lovers Rock</i></a>?!</p><p><i>EK:</i> In a normal year I would say one banger per film, but considering that 1) so many films were snatched from our clutches this year 2) the films that were released were unusually generous in terms of just how many bangers we were given, I would say that anything goes.</p><p><i>JM:</i> I’m highly in favor of <i>Lovers Rock</i> getting the one exception here. </p><p><i>EK:</i> Well, yes, but, then… <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lCXQ\"><i>Palm Springs</i></a> will fight about it.</p><p><i>AY:</i> A vote in favor of throwing rules out of the window—we’ve had enough rules this year.</p><p><i>GG:</i> With those very loose parameters agreed on, let’s launch into it. Who wants to start at the beginning, all the way back when cinema’s main problem was the original title of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hSyO\"><i>Birds of Prey</i></a>?<br/></p><p><i>EK:</i> Remember seeing movies on the big screen? I saw—draws breath—<i>Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i> in the cinema and was so wonderfully entertained and charmed by all of it. Yes, it’s flashy and violent and energetic and all those good things but it’s also loud, and is very clever with its volume. A personal standout moment is Jurnee Smollett-Bell fully arriving as Black Canary as she sings ‘It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World’. Obviously the meanings couldn’t be more on the nose, but the fact that Smollett-Bell’s voice is so elegant and powerful, perfect for a character whose greatest weapon is her voice, just elevates this way beyond any easy wink to camera about how the women are in charge now. There’s just no denying the beauty and power in this musical moment.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><i>GG:</i> If we’re talking on-the-nose lyrics that work spectacularly well, I still haven’t recovered from the two music cues performed by Sidney Flanigan in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lWJk\"><i>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</i></a>. There’s the ‘He’s Got the Power’ opening song, which sees Flanigan’s Autumn alone on her high-school stage, acoustic guitar, glitter, pearls, a Pink Ladies-inspired jacket, performing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSquAYvkAIA\">an edgy cover</a>, near the top of her vocal range, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOu5jM_un3Q\">a usually upbeat doo-wop tune</a> about a guy who makes her do things she doesn’t wanna do, but she adores him anyway. (Watching on is Sharon Van Etten as Autumn’s mother, adding extra grit if you’re a fan, which I am.)</p><p>Later, much later, after the much-written-about “never, rarely, sometimes, always” scene, Autumn and her cousin Skylar hit a Midtown karaoke bar while killing time before their bus home from New York City. In a much more comfortable register, Autumn confidently nails another 1960s hit, Gerry and the Pacemakers’ ‘Don’t Let the Sun Catch You Crying’, while Skylar works on earning their bus fare home. There’s so much going on in a scene that really consists of just two or three shots. The lyrics are superlatively spot-on, and I truly do hope that 2021 will bring joy for every girl and boy.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><i>JM:</i> Since we’re talking about needle drops that are performed by movie characters, can I talk about the build-up to the big needle drop in the finale of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oCUo\">One Night in Miami</a></i>? Leslie Odom Jr.’s Sam Cooke is treated as entertainer first, artist second, with Kingsley Ben-Adir’s Malcolm X spending much of their shared screen time encouraging Cooke to use his platform—one popular among whites—for the greater good. When Cooke finally delivers ‘A Change is Gonna Come’ on <i>The Tonight Show</i>, thus defining his career from that point forward, the impact is tenfold and the film finds its magic in the nick of time.<br/></p><p>If Odom Jr. is a future Best Supporting Actor winner, this scene will go down as his showcase (and ultimately free of the goodwill from <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kmvE\">Hamilton</a></i>’s afterglow). Yes, a civil change did come in the years after the song’s 1964 debut, but we obviously still have a long way to go. And yet, there’s something reflective in the way this moment is about the responsibility of powerful Black voices, and how this idea is executed by director Regina King is profound. It definitely hints without much subtlety that <i>One Night in Miami</i> is but a whisper of what’s to come from her in terms of using her own platform to encourage others to further spread the message. It’s possibly the year’s most important and historic needle drop.</p><p><i>GG:</i> Obviously we need to talk about Steve McQueen’s <i>Small Axe</i> collection, specifically <i>Lovers Rock</i>—a film that’s all about literal needle drops.</p><p><i>JM:</i> ‘Kung Fu Fighting’, I think, is the most essential needle drop in the film because the song, even if nostalgic, has become such a novelty tune, but within seconds McQueen brings back the fresh and exciting communal atmosphere that song creates and is famous for. And it is a subversive moment, because we anticipate <i>Lovers Rock</i> to be comprised primarily of the deep cuts that were coming fresh from Jamaica at the time—but then they drop this one-hit-wonder disco banger that we used to listen to all the time as kids, so it has this sardonic playful tone that’s just pure, non-judgmental joy. It cuts through the tension bubbling outside the house with immediate mock fighting, everyone free to show off their best moves without a sincere threat. You’re already in the door, but the moment the song starts is the film’s true invitation to party down and let loose.<br/></p><!--figure[3]--><p><i>GG:</i> And then there’s the a-cappella singalong to Janet Kay’s ‘Silly Games’—</p><p><i>JM:</i> —which is foreshadowed with the women singing it while they cook during the party prep.</p><p><i>GG:</i> When that sublime scene happens, it’s a glorious feeling as a viewer—not only because house parties are currently dangerous to our health, but also because we’re witnessing a film’s cast and crew give everything over to this improvised moment, and they’re able to do so because they have created the perfect conditions to let it happen. I adore watching a crew that’s in the zone. What is the opposite of a ‘drop’? Is there a term for the euphoric romanticism that these slower dance-floor moments create? Peaking, I guess? In this scene, I also recognized a thread that runs all the way back to Cassandra’s ‘Thank You For the Many Things You Have Done’ in the 1980 film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/nyk\">Babylon</a></i>, another music-soaked movie about West-Indian Londoners. And, in a way, the ‘Too Late to Turn Back Now’ dance-floor magic in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/hxL8\">BlacKkKlansman</a>. (</i>Which reminds me to shout out Spike Lee, the OG needle-drop king, who represented this year with a pair of Marvin Gaye tunes in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnXw\">Da 5 Bloods</a>.)</p><p><i>AY:</i> Sadly I have yet to experience that <i>Lovers Rock</i> euphoria, but would consider the two big drops in Thomas Vinterberg’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lkba\"><i>Another Round</i></a> closest to the feeling than any other movie I’ve seen this year. Danish pop outfit Scarlet Pleasure’s ‘What A Life’ sends the film off perfectly to an explosively cathartic and hopeful finish—aided in no small part by Mads’ glorious dancing. But I almost prefer the slinky way The Meters’ ‘Cissy Strut’ (literally a needle drop) shifts the film to its next level, ushering Mads and his teacher pals into one hot boozy mess of a night to (mis)remember. Bob my head I did.<br/></p><p><i>GG:</i> I want to shout out the folk whose job it is to craft a soundtrack that elevates a film. Music supervision is some kind of insane superpower. Supervisors need to know everything about music—not just what’s been, but what’s coming. They get clearance for the best songs, often on tiny budgets (weirdly, there’s no industry standard for the price of music in films, and the budget rides on some mysterious “favored nations” math), and it’s more often than not about relationships. They also make suggestions about who should cover a song, if they’re not using the original, and in doing so, they have the power to launch new artists with a perfect needle drop. They revive careers, and make stars of unknowns. In <a href=\"https://boxd.it/srXa\">the upcoming documentary about the Dawn Raid music label</a>, there’s an amazing story about the use of the song ‘Swing’ by Samoan-New Zealand hip-hop/EDM star Savage in Judd Apatow’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/23yS\">Knocked Up</a></i>, which changed <i>everything</i> for Savage. It literally changed his life. Basically, somehow, music supervisors exist in the swirl of the zeitgeist, even though a film may be a year or two from release.</p><p><i>EK:</i> Music supervisors have really pulled out all the stops this year. One of my favorite romantic scenes was seeing ‘Honey’ by Robyn pop up in Levan Akin’s gorgeous <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/m0e6\">And Then We Danced</a></i>—to which he credited music supervisor Jen Malone <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/611910164461780992/life-in-film-levan-akin\">when we chatted about the film last year</a>. What I loved was that the song really hadn’t come out that long ago, so it always feels particularly visceral and alive to me to recognize a song that, first of all, is incredible, but also so fresh in my mind that it feels like we very much exist in the same reality as these characters. Especially considering the boys in Akin’s film are exploring their sexuality and Robyn’s music has helped so many people come to terms with theirs, and the lyrics of her song are also felt in the golden light that colors the scene in the film. It’s such a special moment that you can tell comes from the very simple fact that everyone holds Robyn so close in their hearts, and you just know when it’s the right fit. I’m so glad it paid off.</p><p><i>AY:</i> Also, a quick shout-out to <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/iWDU\">Babyteeth</a></i> for dropping Vashti Bunyan’s wistful ’70s folk gem ‘Diamond Day’—a song that seems like it should be overused in twee indie coming-of-age flicks, but as far as I’m aware, hasn’t quite got there yet.</p><p><i>JM:</i> And to <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jTqq\">The Nest</a></i>, for giving us the gift of Carrie Coon in a club letting it all go to Bronski Beat’s ‘Smalltown Boy’.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><i>EK:</i> I feel like the best and most satisfying needle drop moments happen when you have no idea they’re coming—I had seen everyone talking about a Paris Hilton moment in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/loRE\"><i>Promising Young Woman</i></a> but this scene still totally caught me off guard and I miss it whenever I’m not watching it. I can’t say I knew ‘Stars Are Blind’ off by heart beforehand, but I do now. Is it a banger in its own right? I honestly couldn’t say, as whenever I close my eyes I now see Carey Mulligan and Bo Burnham dancing around a pharmacy in shades of baby pink and blue while the most adorable romantic montage I’ve ever seen in my life plays through the honeymoon stage of their relationship. It’s so cheesy and everyone knows it, but it hits such a rare sweet-spot in being uncool, self-aware, glassy-eyed and rosy-cheeked without a dash of cynicism. It’s romantic and silly and so perfect—and for a film with so much bite, it feels like gold dust, a stroke of genius.</p><p><i>JM:</i> There was one needle drop in 2020 that was 32 years in the making. It’s much less about how good the song is (it’s not very), but rather what this moment meant to a beloved franchise and its iconic characters. I’m talking about ‘Face the Music’ from <a href=\"https://boxd.it/i7BI\"><i>Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music</i></a>. When <i>Bill &amp; Ted 3</i> was teased ten years ago, it became clear that their destiny had not been fulfilled in <i>Bogus Journey</i>’s coda. And so, in 2020, Bill and Ted are still hunting down the song that will save the Universe. Switching the mission from themselves to their daughters is a good way for original authors Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon to write around Bill and Ted’s goofy incompetence, and by adding contributions from the world’s greatest composers (Mozart, Kid Cudi, et al), they more than compensate for the imagination required to live up to the song’s grandiose promise. The climactic song (performed on my local freeway of all places!) is deliberately a mixed bag. It has to be—it’s the best-case scenario for too many cooks. But it’s the final ingredient, when Bill and Ted don their guitars at the last second—with a nod of approval from Jimi Hendrix—that delivers rock ’n’ roll’s promise to save the universe, ’80s style.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i>GG:</i> There are many more songs on our playlist that we could talk about, but since we’re supposed to be on holiday and this is a no-rules competition, can I finish by nominating <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oUAG\"><i>David Byrne’s American Utopia</i></a> as the overall 2020 winner for <i>most</i> best needle drops?</p><p><i>JM:</i> You probably need to choose at least one song from that Broadway sensation to talk about.</p><p><i>GG:</i> Fine, then it can only be the cover of Janelle Monáe’s ‘Hell You Talmabout’.

Sylvia barely speaks at all, caught between a faith that isn’t hers and a home that isn’t either.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><!-- more --></p><p>The film’s triptych structure emerged after Msangi spent months grappling with how to create a feature-length screenplay out of her <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iqvE\">original short film</a>. “Having just come off of the short, I was focusing on Walter’s story. But [I] didn’t think that was the most original story I could tell,” she says. “And then, out of indecision between whether I should make it Walter’s or Sylvia’s story, I decided to just do both. Initially it was two perspectives that I was looking at. But I realized that Esther’s story was really the linchpin for both of their stories, and it wouldn’t make sense not to have hers.”</p><p>Giving Walter, Esther and Sylvia their own chapters makes <i>Farewell Amor</i> a stronger film than if it had followed a singular, traditional protagonist. Extreme conservatism in one chapter is revealed as a desire to avoid pain in another; one character’s cramped living room is another’s space to dance freely. Writing on Letterboxd, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ogakh\">Tabby points out</a> how the three-part narrative structure grants meaningful subjectivity to characters who deserve it: “It’s so easy for Westernized perspectives to steamroll over films that deal in cultural disparities and thematics, but <i>Farewell Amor</i> takes important steps in showing all sides of the story,” she writes. “It was refreshing to see [the characters] each given the space to exist.”</p><p>This layering of voices happens in the camerawork, too. Each section of the narrative is marked with a visual language of its own, complete with specific color palettes and cinematographic techniques. Msangi thinks fondly about the work she put in with cinematographer Bruce Francis Cole to make the chapters distinct. “For Walter’s, it’s sort of a slow cinema, where there’s a lot of still framing. It’s almost like he’s stuck, you know? Stuck in the frame between two surfaces, two hard surfaces, a window frame, a door frame. And in Sylvia’s, we wanted to have it reflect her livelihood, her restlessness. All handheld cameras, all movement. And then for Esther, she’s very observant. She’s been taking everything in, almost in an investigative style, but also a little bit romantic. She’s romanticized this setup, so a lot of close shots, a lot of soft lighting.”</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Music gives <i>Farewell Amor</i> a cohesion across the different storylines. “Music is, for these characters in particular, and for me, kind of a third language,” Msangi says. “It gives you a glimpse under the covers, what’s under the sheets.” The soundtrack underscores strong performances from Mwine, Jah and Lawson, lending depth to their quietude and vibrance to their movement. Msangi also notes how sound became a cornerstone of her collaboration with the actors: “As I was writing from different perspectives, in order to help me get into each character’s skin, I would listen to the music that they would be interested in.” She later shared these playlists with the actors, using the songs to communicate what words couldn’t.</p><p>Msangi has a good laugh as she tries to think about the major films that inspired her to become a filmmaker. “You know, I don’t have that. Well, I do have that, but not for the reasons that most of my film peers have,” she says. Growing up in East Africa in the ’80s and ’90s, little to none of the programming on television was local. What did kids watch instead? “We watched <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28U0\"><i>Rambo</i></a> for probably ten years straight, and then <i>Rambo</i> knockoffs for another ten years after that. I decided to become a filmmaker because of horrible <i>Rambo</i> knockoff films.”</p><p>“I grew up surrounded by such colorful and delightful and interesting and funny people,” Msangi says. “And none of that was reflected anywhere in the media.” As she grew older, she sought out African films she couldn’t access in her youth. Now, they’re some of her highest recommendations. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ousmane-sembene/\">Ousmane Sembène</a> is the first African director whose filmography she ever got the chance to dive into. Sembène’s 50-year career has garnered him the affectionate title of ‘Father of African film’ among many critics and scholars, who laud him for his dramas, including <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3jIQ\"><i>Black Girl</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/camp-de-thiaroye/\"><i>Camp de Thiaroye</i></a>. Msangi, however, finds herself taken with his unique sense of humor. She has also been inspired by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/safi-faye/\">Safi Faye</a>, another Senegalese director, who became the first sub-Saharan African woman to attain commercial distribution in 1975—and whose film <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7CG8\"><i>Mossane</i></a> portrays sexual intimacy with an openness Msangi hadn’t seen elsewhere.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>In <i>Farewell Amor</i>, Sylvia’s chapter reads like a compacted coming-of-age film. Msangi points to South African director Darrell James Roodt’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1bFU\"><i>Sarafina!</i></a> as an influence in that regard. “It was showing for two weeks in Nairobi, and I lined up for four hours to watch,” she says about the film, a drama about youth involvement in the 1976 Soweto uprising. “Even though it’s from a different part of the continent, I’d never seen young African teenagers on a screen before.” More recently, she has loved 2011 TIFF breakout and Oscar contender <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3fLw\"><i>Death for Sale</i></a> by Moroccan director Faouzi Bensaïdi, and Radha Blank’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mYXq\"><i>The Forty-Year-Old Version</i></a> is her favorite film of 2020. She’s hopeful about the future of Black American cinema: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ava-duvernay/\">Ava DuVernay</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ryan-coogler/\">Ryan Coogler</a> are two of her favorite working directors.</p><p>Msangi’s selections are wide in range, but there’s still one thing holding them together: themes of vulnerability, community and celebration of identity, across different decades and genres. In fact, her approach to watching movies isn’t far off from the way she made her own—<i>Farewell Amor</i> maps concurrent experiences of disparate people, and Msangi’s tastes seem driven by the same balance of vastness and specificity.</p><p>“I’m a filmmaker who really abhors working on the same kind of story over and over again, the same genre, the same kinds of characters,” she says. “So I’m not going to make my career just telling stories about immigrants or about, you know, their wretched troubles,” she laughs. “I don’t want to do that.”</p><p>Msangi’s next project will be an African-American period piece; beyond that, she hopes to make films in several locations: the Caribbean, Europe and all over the African continent. “I really would like to just have a lot of fun with my career. You know? Because it’s a fun and magical industry that we work in! The work that we do in creating these stories and hopes and dreams—we create magic, so it <i>should</i> be fun.”</p>"

Critics and audiences alike were confused, bored, horrified, or—perhaps most damning of all—indifferent to what was once garlanded as the cinema event of the festive season. I suppose it was, in the same way getting drunk at your office party and throwing up in the street crying into your chips is a festive event.</p><p>But here we are, some 200-or-something months later, living in a post-<i>Cats</i> world, and I’m thinking once more of Tom Hooper’s magnum opus, and the perverse pleasures of films that we know are of little to no artistic merit, and merrily watch all the same. Despite <a href=\"https://boxd.it/U3Cb7\">giving the film a rather harsh review back then</a>, I can’t truly dislike it. Does the thought of so much money being spunked away on such a futile and stupid gesture sit uneasy with me? <i>Plus ça change</i> for Hollywood. But the knowledge that <i>Cats</i> had so much work put into it and yet came out so truly nightmarish and overwrought is inherently quite funny. And gosh, it feels good to laugh in a year that hasn’t provided much cause to.</p><p>As it turns out, <i>Cats</i> has a rather long tail. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/highest-rated-obsessively-rewatched-club-1/\">When Ella Kemp recently looked into the highest-rated, most obsessively rewatched films</a> from the Letterboxd community, one outlier kept sticking its ears up—yes, <i>Cats</i>. It is officially the lowest-rated, most obsessively rewatched film on Letterboxd in 2020, and more than that, it received the largest ratings bump from its obsessive rewatchers of any ‘bad’ film. While the average Letterboxd rating for <i>Cats</i> is one and a half stars out of five, its average among obsessive members who watch it again and again is a much higher 3.7.</p><p>I must salute the efforts of Letterboxd members <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jamesp/\">James</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/joecinefilm/\">Joseph</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/evanorra/\">Ray</a>—the most obsessive <i>Cats</i> rewatchers of all—who have seen the film a combined 94 times. Every four days or so for the past year, one of them has sat down to watch Idris Elba cavorting around like the Nightman from <i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>. They’re not alone, and this is <i>Cats</i>’ great achievement: even while it was still in cinemas it was attracting the irony-loving repeat audiences, such as Alamo Dratfhouse’s Rowdy Screenings in the United States.</p><!--figure[1]--><p>There’s communal value in ‘so bad it’s good’, as the against-all-odds success of Tommy Wiseau’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ICY\"><i>The Room</i></a> has proven for years (“<i>The Room</i> is not a comedy of errors; it is almost purely errors,” <i>The Cut</i>’s Adam Novak <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/the-psychological-appeal-of-truly-terrible-movies.html\">once wrote</a>). During the pandemic, we’ve turned to television and films for comfort, and nothing is more comforting than the familiar, the funny and the fantastic failures.</p><p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/movies/nostalgic-classic-movies.html\"><i>The New York Times</i> reported on</a> the attraction to nostalgia during stressful periods, and arguably, nothing has been collectively more stressful in recent times than living through a global pandemic. In that article, Dr. Wing Yee Cheung, who studies nostalgia, explained why, in uncertain times, we might be attracted to the things we enjoyed when we were younger: “We feel that we have lost footing at the present time, and we gain some comfort by taking a step back and revisiting something that reminds us of a time that we used to feel more connected with other people.” So there’s a scientific reason we’ve all been rewatching <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-lord-of-the-rings-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/star-wars-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">Star Wars</a></i>: we’re trying to draw strength from our past experiences.</p><p>But what’s the science behind our being repeatedly drawn to the dregs of cinema? To the cinematic equivalents of a Big Mac and large Coke, that we consume not because they are fundamentally nutritional, but because they nourish us in a different way? First off, defining ‘bad’ in the context of movies means appreciating that there are all kinds of bad, including incompetent-bad (they didn’t know what they were doing!), camp-bad (Sexy! Goofy! Fun!), camp’s exploitative, self-aware cousin, trash-bad (a beloved genre of mine), and misunderstood-bad. The reasons certain films get written off as bad upon release are myriad and often structural. For every <i>The Room</i> there’s a <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Efw\">Jennifer’s Body</a></i>, which started life on Letterboxd as a 2.3 stinker but has climbed in the intervening decade to a 3.2 average (and is still rising, the Letterboxd statisticians tell me).</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Culture writer Phil Christman, in <a href=\"https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/eating-and-being/articles/the-cinema-of-inadvertence-or-why-i-like-bad-movies\"><i>The Hedgehog Review</i></a>, writes about his attraction to the incompetent-bad category. “We bad-movie watchers have our own anti-criteria, the sorts of badness we prefer,” he explains, in passionate defense of quote-unquote Bad Movies, beginning with the genre’s <i>Citizen Kane</i>: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1W50\"><i>Plan 9 from Outer Space</i></a>. “The particular kind of badness I like is the film that is childish or incompetent—what it does, it does inadvertently.” Meanwhile, the great Michael Musto is a camp-bad fan, <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/05/07/the-joy-of-watching-and-rewatching-movies-so-bad-theyre-good/\">writing that the appeal for his long-running good/bad movie club</a> is in the combination of snark, fallen-star-power and escapism. (The bizarre 1973 musical <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3mPK\"><i>Lost Horizon</i></a> is a favorite in his club.)</p><p><i>Cats</i>, without doubt, is the ultimate kind of bad: a spectacular misfire that carries a blind, unwarranted self-confidence. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cineflek/film/cats-2019/1/\">This <i>Cats</i> review from Ethan Colburn</a> might sum up my feelings on the subject best:</p><blockquote><p>“If you are someone who hasn’t seen this movie because of how horrible the reviews are, I beg you to reconsider. This might be the most unique experience you can have with any film. I can’t describe the feeling of disgust and wonder that this film provides. It is so jarring, you are immediately taken out of your world and shot into a brand new nightmare that you never could have imagined yourself. Then you realize your life isn’t so bad.”</p></blockquote><p>I think, then, we could name Tom Hooper’s bad a kind of schadenfreude-bad. Hooper is a filmmaker with 24 Oscar nominations to his name. His 2012 adaptation of<a href=\"https://boxd.it/2TT4\"> <i>Les Misérables</i></a> made more than $440 million at the worldwide box office. The cast of <i>Cats</i> includes knights, dames, Oscar winners, musical theater’s finest and Taylor Swift. How could so much talent (and a $95 million budget) amount to so little? <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rockmarooned/film/cats-2019/\">Jesse Hassenger sums up the film’s sick appeal</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“All are equal here. Judi Dench is no better at acting than Taylor Swift. Jennifer Hudson is no more effective at singing than Rebel Wilson. Ian McKellen has no more dignity than Jason Derulo. For possibly the first time in cinematic history, James Corden is no more of a nuisance than anyone else on screen. All brought to the same level. All <i>Cats</i>.”</p></blockquote><p>There are plenty more inadvertently ‘bad’ films that are well loved by this community. <i>Cats</i> aside, Letterboxd’s 2020 data shows high numbers of rewatches of low-rating blockbusters <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6fBW\"><i>Batman v Superman</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jkMG\"><i>Eurovision: The Story of Fire</i> <i>Saga</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/27V2\"><i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fUCu\"><i>Trolls World Tour</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gdK8\"><i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i></a>. And when we asked on Twitter what other low-rated cinema gems were lapped up this year, the responses included <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/najM\">Unhinged</a>,</i> the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/mall-cop-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Paul Blart</i></a> films, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Zk8\"><i>Grease 2</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20Gu\"><i>Highlander 2</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2qne\"><i>Ghost Rider 2</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7IPq\">the worst <i>Cars</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1WDm\">the <i>Friday the 13th</i> where Jason takes Manhattan</a>.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>Going further back, in a delightful bit of hive-mind research, Jack Moulton asked members to submit their genuine, all-time favorite movies, for his ‘<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/list/its-someones-favorite-movie/by/rating-lowest/\">It’s Someone’s Favorite Movie</a>’ list. Sorting the list by lowest-rated reveals that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ueo\"><i>George of the Jungle 2</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Y1E\"><i>Lady in the Water</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1QGk\"><i>Freddy Got Fingered</i></a> all have their ardent defenders.</p><p>These Letterboxd members will find no judgment from me. More than a few of my own personal favorites (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/23Uu\"><i>Southland Tales</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3lPY\"><i>The Bling Ring</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Vmk\"><i>Showgirls</i></a>) also make the lower ranks of the list. I’m entirely willing to not only accept but embrace the fact that I sometimes have terrible taste. Earlier this year I had a week where I just watched the <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/jackass-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">Jackass</a></i> movies back to back, three times in a row. I will defend Johnny Knoxville with my dying breath. I have seen every Adam Sandler film multiple times and enjoyed most of them, including <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2pQu\"><i>Jack and Jill</i></a>. I believe more of us should embrace our duality: we can love the good, the bad and the ugly with impunity.</p><p>This is something Catherine Bray explores in ‘<a href=\"https://boxd.it/sQKU\">Guilty Pleasures</a>’, her essay film analyzing the rom-coms, action flicks, schlocky horrors and everything in between, that attract ‘so bad it’s good’ labelling. She points towards a more useful concept of ‘guilty pleasure’—one that absolves cheap production values and studio misfires in favor of critical thinking. Since filmmakers continue to fly like Icarus toward the sun, with often horrifying results, it’s worth turning the ol’ brain cogs in a different direction. Rather than punching down, it’s about conscious viewing: thinking about the context and content of what we’re watching; acknowledging, and engaging with, the film’s circumstances, as much as the film itself.</p><p>Speaking of circumstances: if <i>Cats</i> did one (more) thing wrong, it was to come out a year too early. We had that brief, collective moment of confused caterwauling inside actual cinemas last winter, but just imagine the horrified glee of a locked-down globe if it was released directly into households now. Worldwide watch party, anyone? No? Just me and my cat, then. Have yourselves a merry little Christmas, Letterboxd family, and kick back with a film you love, the worse the better.</p>"

She’s logged <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5k6k\">every film she’s seen in theaters since 1996</a>.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>What inspired your <a href=\"https://boxd.it/i4yS\">Neverending Christmas List</a>? Can you please explain the minimum requirement for eligibility?</b><br/>My <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/danju/\">husband</a> had told me about a list on Letterboxd of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hM3C\">Every Horror Film Made from 1895–Present</a> and that gave me the idea to start the neverending Christmas list. My eligibility rules are not strict at all. It can be a film that centers on or around Christmas time. Even New Year’s counts in my book—as long as there’s a moment in the film that has a Christmas song, a Christmas scene, or Christmas decorations. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a7u\"><i>Die Hard</i></a> is definitely a Christmas film. First of all, it takes place on Christmas Eve at an office Christmas party. There’s that great note that John McClane sends to Hans Gruber on a dead guy’s shirt: “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho.” Now that’s Christmas! There are a couple of titles that test my relaxed requirements. Examples would be <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ab2\"><i>Psycho</i></a>—there are a few Christmas decorations at the beginning [and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanFuller/status/1337470632435404800\">Bryan Fuller agrees</a>]—and the documentary <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2UzE\"><i>Beauty Day</i></a> by Canadian director Jay Cheel, which has Christmas lights at the end.</p><p><b>And what percentage of the films have you seen?<br/></b>As of right now, I&rsquo;ve watched 20 percent—that’s 882 of the 4,322 films on the list. I’ve got a lot of homework to do. Here’s a few hidden gems I recommend: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2z9U\"><i>Mon oncle Antoine</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1wRM\"><i>Holiday Affair</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1n50\"><i>Remember the Night</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7COG\"><i>Olivia</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/78Kk\"><i>On the Twelfth Day…</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hGHu\"><i>Bing Crosby’s Merrie Olde Christmas</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4Ft6\"><i>One Christmas</i></a>, which is Katherine Hepburn’s last role.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>When does your Christmas movie viewing season start?<br/></b>I usually start mid-November to try to keep up with the TV rom-coms because they start to air even before Hallowe’en. This year on Hallowe’en night we rewatched <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1r723B\"><i>The Night of the Hunter</i></a> and I had forgotten that there was a sequence that was set at Christmas time. It was a perfect segue between Hallowe’en and Christmas, so I started November 1st. As far as how I pick what to watch, I go through my list and randomly pick some. I try to watch as many first-time watches and mix up the genres. But the closer I get to Christmas, the more I want to watch my favorites—for the most part I go with the flow. Christmas Day is usually a day of family time, but I try to sneak in one favorite if I can.</p><p><b>What was the first Christmas film that got you into all of this?<br/></b>I’ve always loved Christmas and growing up I watched the yearly airings of vintage Christmas cartoons and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Qy6\"><i>A Muppet Family Christmas</i></a>. When <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Fg\"><i>Home Alone</i></a> came out it was an instant obsession, then <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29F6\">Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</a></i> was just as good. Even now it’s our yearly tradition for my husband and I to watch the <i>Home Alones</i> while we decorate the Christmas tree.</p><p><b>If not <i>Home Alone</i>, what is your all-time favorite Christmas film?</b><br/><a href=\"https://boxd.it/28xA\"><i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i></a> is up there for me. Partly because growing up I watched it every Christmas Eve and kind of forced my dad to watch it with me. I think he secretly didn’t mind. As a kid, I didn’t dwell on the sad parts of the story, I just wanted to go to that candy shop and run in Bedford Falls like George in that beautiful thick fake snow. Now as an adult, I appreciate the story about a small town coming together to support a man at his lowest of lows more. Jimmy Stewart is amazing as George Bailey and we can all see ourselves at some point in his journey in the film. The chemistry and comedic timing between Stewart and Donna Reed is one of the best. Every time they sing ‘Auld Lang Syne’, I always get a bit misty-eyed.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>What have you noticed about the ways in which Christmas films have changed over the years?<br/></b>In classic Christmas storytelling, there are a lot more religion-centered ones like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1F3m\"><i>The Bishop’s Wife</i></a> and <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i>. The ’80s and ’90s were about the blockbusters that the whole family could enjoy; <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2awa\"><i>Batman Returns</i></a>, <i>Home Alone</i>, and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TWK\"><i>The Santa Clause</i></a>. The last twenty years have brought us a lot of different movies, but I do find that the start of the 2000s had a better crop of Christmas movies; <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aeU\"><i>Love Actually</i></a>,<i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1VyK\">Elf</a></i>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Qg2\"><i>Tokyo Godfathers</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1VzS\"><i>Far from Heaven</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29WQ\"><i>Bridget Jones’s Diary</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aMC\"><i>About a Boy</i></a> and so many more. The last decade has been saturated by the rom-coms of Hallmark, Lifetime and their imitators, but from the last five years, a few stand out that could be destined to become Christmas classics: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7DPK\"><i>Carol</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/aSVk\"><i>Little Women</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/9n9W\"><i>The Night Before</i></a>.</p><p><b>The best, most rewatched Christmas stories tend to be remade. Do you have a classic Christmas story that you always love, no matter who’s telling it?<br/></b>Hands down Charles Dickens’ <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. From my favorite—<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1QDg\"><i>Scrooge</i></a>—to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1WgC\"><i>The Muppet Christmas Carol</i></a>, to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Y9e\"><i>Scrooged</i></a>. Growing up, I had the book of <i>Mickey’s Christmas Carol</i> and I loved the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1NkU\">cartoon adaptation</a>. I love to see the different actors’ excitement and elation at the end when Scrooge wakes up on Christmas Day. My ultimate favorite is Alistair Sim in 1951’s <i>Scrooge</i>. He’s so jubilant asking the maid what day it is and wishing himself Merry Christmas in the mirror. It’s a bit darker than others. When I was a kid, the intro with Jacob Marley and the build-up of the chains scared me, but I couldn’t stop watching. Patrick Stewart’s Ebenezer [in the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JKu\">1999 TV movie</a>] is also great for his relief that he survived the journey through time. What an actor! An honorable mention to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1DFy\"><i>The Shop Around the Corner</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2lq8\"><i>In the Good Old Summertime</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Yye\"><i>You’ve Got Mail</i></a>, which are all based on [the 1937 Hungarian play <i>Parfumerie</i> by Miklós László].</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Treat Williams stars in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/s4oG\">not one</a> but <a href=\"https://boxd.it/s0zg\">two of</a> this season’s films (who knew he could sing?!). Which actors bring that special spark to festive films for you?</b><br/>Yes, and boy can he sing! Another actor who can sing and puts me straight in the Christmas mood is Bing Crosby. Those classic songs in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Qky\"><i>White Christmas</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Q4K\"><i>Holiday Inn</i></a> are favorites of mine. Jimmy Stewart is an obvious one. He has that charm that’s perfect for Christmas movies, especially in <i>The Shop Around the Corner</i>.</p><p><b>What’s your guiltiest pleasure on the list? Why do we love cheesy movies so much?!<br/></b>Every year I watch TCM’s Classic Christmas marathon [but I also watch] the Hallmark and Lifetime Christmas rom-coms. For me, I love them partly because there’s always a happy ending. I love to see all the decorations and all the cute small towns—some I wish existed so I could visit them because they’re so darn cute! Another reason I love them is the nostalgia, as some of the better ones star TV actors from the ’90s and ’00s like Candice Cameron Bure, Lacey Chabert, Jonathan Bennett, Adrian Grenier, Mario Lopez, Alicia Witt, Alison Sweeney and so many others.</p><p><b>One of the other great Christmas-themed lists on Letterboxd is the one about <a href=\"https://boxd.it/S3DY\">Christmas movie posters with white heterosexual couples wearing red and green</a>—though many members pride themselves on having seen none of them.</b><br/>I like those movies because I can zone out and enjoy the predictable Christmas ride. However, like other Letterboxd members, I know that these aren’t Oscar-caliber films—though some are better than others! I’m glad that the powers that make these movies are starting to be more inclusive with more POC and LGTBQ+ characters. As a wheelchair user with a physical disability, I was happy to see that Lifetime has an upcoming one called <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/rXIk\">Christmas Ever After</a>,</i> starring Ali Stroker.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>Indeed, our <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4d0eK\">Make the Yuletide Gay</a> list is an attempt to highlight queer festive films, but the pickings have been slim.<br/></b>Yes, very slim. There’s been queer characters in Christmas films but it’s your stereotypical gay friend or something like that. This year I feel there’s a shift in the air to be more inclusive. My favorites this year so far have been the star-filled lesbi-rom-com <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iS3I\"><i>Happiest Season</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/s0zg\"><i>The Christmas House</i></a>—featuring a landmark first gay couple in a Hallmark festive film, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/s4oG\"><i>Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/n4uY\"><i>Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</i></a>—with Ricky Martin! I’m looking forward to checking out <a href=\"https://boxd.it/rKHe\"><i>A New York Christmas Wedding</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/rXIO\"><i>The Christmas Setup</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/sI8I\"><i>Dashing in December</i></a>.</p><p><b>What is the scariest Christmas film that your horror-loving husband has made you watch?<br/></b>The best one is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Js6\"><i>Black Christmas</i></a>. I love that it’s female-centered and ahead of its time in their portrayals. The killer’s POV really gets me into it and still to this day puts me on edge, so much so that an ornament fell off our tree while watching it this year and it freaked me out!</p><p><b>Also, should we be watching <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YzQ\"><i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i></a> on Hallowe’en or on Christmas?<br/></b>I watch <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> on both holidays so you get the best of both worlds—the ghoulishness of Hallowe’en and the merriment of Christmas!</p><p><b>What other films on your list show Christmas in an unusual light?<br/></b>The first weird one that popped to mind is <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2yMw\">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a>.</i> That was weird! Also, from what I’ve watched I would say <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2axs\"><i>Eyes Wide Shut</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Vbc\"><i>The Ref</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1nTO\"><i>3 Godfathers</i></a> are not your usual Christmas films. I do have quite a few on the list I have to watch that seem weird and unusual like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lim\"><i>Elves</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2M6Y\"><i>Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hiC\"><i>Santa Claus Conquers the Martians</i></a>.</p><p>[Editor’s note: Previous How I Letterboxd interviewee <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/\">Dave Vis</a> urges you <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/617318590091313152/how-i-letterboxd-dave-vis\">not to watch</a> <i>Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny</i> under any circumstances.]</p><p><b>Which actor is the quintessential Santa Claus?<br/></b>For me, it’s the Santa in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1SRu\">Miracle on 34th Street</a>,</i> played by Edmund Gwenn. He truly embodied the part in the way he plays Kris Kringle. The gentleness and innocence he shows throughout the film is magical. It’s no wonder he won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>Of course, so many films in the Christmas canon are American films. What are some of the best Christmas films from around the world?<br/></b>This question makes me realize I haven’t watched enough Christmas movies from around the world. With that being said here’s a few; <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ZEs\"><i>A Christmas Tale</i></a> from France, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3uw2\"><i>A Child’s Christmas in Wales</i></a> from the UK, Tokyo Godfathers from Japan and Ingmar Bergman’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/22go\"><i>Fanny and Alexander</i></a> from Sweden. <i>Mon oncle Antoine</i> is a great Canadian film set in a small mining village during Christmas. It reminded me of the stories my mom and grandma talked about their Christmas traditions in their small village.</p><p><b>Are there any overrated classics you want to protest?<br/></b>I didn’t watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29sw\"><i>A Christmas Story</i></a> growing up, so when I finally did watch it as an adult, I didn’t connect with it. The iconic scenes are funny and all, but it’s just okay. Now I’ll be on my hubby’s naughty list!</p><p><b>Does the film marathon continue through that purgatory week between Christmas and New Year? Do you have any film-related traditions to ring in the New Year?<br/></b>It does continue during that week to a certain extent. Some years after Christmas I’m done and what I haven’t watched goes to the following year but other years I can watch a few more and not feel overwhelmed. On New Year’s we have no traditions per se, but this year we might do a Tarantino marathon.</p><p><b>Christmas season is also synonymous with awards season. You keep track of a lot of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/juliec/tag/academy-award/lists/\">Academy Awards history</a>. How are you feeling about the awards season this year?<br/></b>First off, like many others, I haven’t even set foot in a theater this year and that is sad. I hope that the theater-going experience is not irreparably damaged. One good thing that came from the pandemic is film festivals streamed online and we were fortunate to watch some <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4EsZI\">great titles</a> from TIFF from the comfort of our home in September. I saw <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnRy\">Nomadland</a>,</i> and it’s going to be a frontrunner for many of the main categories. I hope Regina King’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oCUo\"><i>One Night in Miami</i></a> gets some love. Miranda July’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jJDY\"><i>Kajillionaire</i></a> script is so unique—Evan Rachel Wood and Richard Jenkins should be contenders. I haven’t watched a lot of docs yet but <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiNW\"><i>Boys State</i></a> stands out. I’m also eager to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/krga\"><i>First Cow</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mL9M\"><i>Minari</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kQpQ\"><i>Ammonite</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiSC\"><i>The Truffle Hunters</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/ioLA\"><i>Soul</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mIuC\"><i>Mank</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/m8Ie\"><i>The Father</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/loRE\"><i>Promising Young Woman</i></a>.</p><p><b>This Christmas is going to be weird for a lot of people. What’s one film you’d recommend for a guaranteed happiness injection?<br/></b>Weird indeed. If I have to pick just one it would be John Favreau’s <i>Elf</i>. Will Ferrell as Buddy the Elf instantly brings a smile to my face. You can feel his joy for Christmas from start to finish. From the classic claymation, to New York City at Christmas, to eating all that sugar, to that hilarious scene with Peter Dinklage—it’s Christmas gold!</p><p><b>And finally, are there some other Letterboxd members you recommend we follow?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/emilybabyy/\">Emily</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/flurryheaven/\">Flurryheaven</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/guyzo997/\">Guyzo997</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tripleholmes/\">Peter Spencer</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/michaeldean/\">Michael Dean</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thatmoviefreak/\">Brent Vanhomwegen</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/arahiddleston/\">Ara Hiddleston</a> and also some more <a href=\"https://boxd.it/BAEG\">Christmas lists</a>.</p>"

Oh, his timing. Just as the northern hemisphere days were turning cold, and the drawn-out misery of the pandemic was really taking hold all over again, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donhertzfeldt/status/1314328105151074307?s=20\">Hertzfeldt tweeted</a>:</p><!--tweet[1]--><p>And like that, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/rmsk\">World of Tomorrow Three: The Absent Destinations of David Prime</a></i> was ours, an overnight gift to the quarantined and bereaved-weary, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow3/\">on Vimeo</a> for all to rent or own. The gifts, they keep coming: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/a1Vww\">a master list of movies that have their fingerprints on the <i>World of Tomorrow</i> universe</a>, and now, in recognition of our community’s love for his films—and in his signature lower-case—the answers to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/8W8Yi\">questions asked</a> in an exclusive Letterboxd Q&amp;A.</p><p>To make things easier for Don, we grouped similar questions (and have noted which members asked what). Read on for more than you ever thought you might get to know about Hertzfeldt’s process, brain, heart and influences.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>From “holograms that yell at you!” to the stunning colors, textures and folds of the blue mountains, to attributes David progressively deletes to make room for memories, would you please give us an insight into <i>World of Tomorrow Three’</i>s world-building process?</b> —<i>Letterboxd</i><br/>in the grand scheme of the series, episodes one and two still felt like baby steps to me. episode three was my first chance to really start blowing things up and exploring this universe. when i’m writing, i don’t want to worry about going over the top or think about structure or meaning or really much of anything yet. writing is playtime, it should be fun and messy. i <i>want</i> to go over the top. there is no top. i don’t want to start <i>thinking</i> too much until i’m rewriting and sorting through it all. thinking too much too soon can get in the way, like being too aware of when you’re trying to fall asleep. when you write a diary entry or a text to a friend, there’s no self-consciousness or creative blocks, you just write. it’s casual and fluid and automatic. but if you’re asked to write a term paper or a screenplay, suddenly all those lights turn off. it can be paralyzing. it’s hard to get to that place of truly not caring what anyone thinks and approach all forms of writing just as freely as writing those immediate thoughts in your diary. but that’s what i try to do.</p><p><b>When you start writing a new piece, do you usually start with a plot idea, a thematic idea, one uniform philosophical notion, or a little bit of each?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kodiakjs/\"><i>Kodiak J. Sanders</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/trenz/\"><i>Trenz</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/eatingurtables/\"><i>Mr. Tables</i></a><br/>i don’t think i ever write in a straight line. i’ll jot down a hundred stray ideas over time, and one day i’ll sit down and see what connections might be made out of them. i really want this scene to be in the movie, so how do i get there? this is a good line, how can i get a character to say it? so the actual story usually only starts to reveal itself when i sit down to logic all these bits and pieces out. hey, in order to connect this strange idea to <i>that</i> strange idea, suddenly there is a very interesting third scene.</p><p><b>I’m astounded by how much the animation and the visuals improve with each instalment of <i>World of Tomorrow</i>. What have you done differently for each one?</b> <i>—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/askelund/\">Aske Lund</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cringetacular/\">Cringetacular</a></i><br/>the characters needed to physically perform a lot more in episodes two and three so there were more demands put on the animation. when emily 4 dances or david staggers up a mountain, those sorts of scenes were animated in “ones”, which means doing 24 drawings per second versus my usual twelve. it’s still all 2D hand animation, just more of a classic disney approach that gives the movement a smoother look and a little more room for nuance. and obviously it takes a lot more work. but i hesitate to call such things improvements because i’m not sure i like the idea of different techniques being thought of as good or bad. it’s just another way of doing things. it really depends, sometimes super limited animation can be more effective.</p><p><b>Likewise, <i>Part Three</i>’s sound design is incredible. What conditions did you create it in, and what are all those sounds, and how do you have such an incredible command of the cut-to-silence trick?!</b> —<i>Letterboxd</i><br/>thanks, the sound design is always my favorite thing to do. other than julia’s lines, it’s easy to forget that all the animation starts with dead silence. obviously there’s no sound coming from a live-action set. so adding sound and music to everything, usually pretty late in production, is when all the stuff i’ve been working on suddenly starts to feel like an actual movie. this is not a future that works very well—particularly david’s, which predates everything else we’ve seen so far by a century or two—so you’re hearing a lot of creaky old hard drives booting up, electric distortions, and bent circuits from broken toys.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b><i>World of Tomorrow</i> used to fill me with existential dread, but now with the current state of the world it’s become more and more comforting in a strange way. Do you feel that at all as you make new episodes?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/themarianogg/\">mariano gg</a></i><br/>i wish that were possible but when i’m making something i’m usually so close to it i’m unable to see anything but all the things i need to fix.</p><p><b>Can you talk a little bit about sourcing the photo-realistic images for the backgrounds in <i>Part Three</i>?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/\">Jack Moulton</a></i><br/>most of the environments were 2D images i built in photoshop, usually starting from close-up photos of different textures (like sandstone), all sort of reshaped and puzzle-pieced into something new. an easy to see example was david’s cockpit, which was cobbled together from all sorts of different old aircraft engine and machine parts. the trick in building and lighting these locations was always figuring out where the line was drawn in making these places realistic, but not <i>too</i> realistic for minimal characters to inhabit. i kept landing on a sort of painterly looking middle ground.</p><p><b>If the cloning process in <i>World of Tomorrow</i> existed right now, would you go through that process and create clones of yourself to prolong your life?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/timrod/\"><i>tim</i></a><br/>probably not, that process doesn’t seem to work so well.</p><p><b>If you were put into the world you’ve created, would you buy gills?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lauren2255/\">Lauren Torres</a></i><br/>i tend to avoid putting my head under because i almost always get water in my ears so i guess i wouldn’t need them. gills also seem like they’d be a real nuisance to keep clean.</p><p><b>What does love mean, and why do your characters go through so much effort to find it?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/andrewmichalko/\">Andrew Michalko</a></i><br/>oh man.</p><p><b>In this year of years, what do you hope people will understand about death and its inevitability (or is it all there on the screen, and if so, that’s okay too)?</b> —<i>Letterboxd</i><br/>understanding death and its inevitability is maybe the most valuable thing a person can do for themselves.</p><p><b>Was the absence of Emily Prime in <i>Part Three</i> a practical decision [Don’s then-four-year-old niece Winona provided Emily’s voice] or an intentional departure from the first two films?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mchearn/\">Michael</a></i><br/>it was both. i couldn’t find a way to fit her in naturally and i also felt like the series needed to start growing in other directions and not rest on the past.<i> episode two</i> had also been really difficult to write, it was so reliant on winona’s recordings, and it felt like the dam was really broken when i was finally able to write without any restrictions this time.</p><p><b>In a series like <i>World of Tomorrow</i>, where you headed in a direction that is a lot more plot-driven than your previous work, how far in advance do you plan? Did you always know this was in David’s past, or are these stories told one at a time?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/welchie/\"><i>Ryan Welch</i></a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kodiakjs/\"><i>Kodiak J. Sanders</i></a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/delaramajulius/\"><i>julius</i></a><i>,</i> <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/philadelphian/\">Alex Leon</a></i><br/>i could tell early on that this wasn’t a story like <i>it’s such a beautiful day</i> with a clear beginning, middle and end, but a much wilder thing that could continue to grow. the openness of it is still what makes it so interesting to me. i have all sorts of notes for the next episodes but if i already knew what would happen in <i>episode nine</i> i think that would take a lot of the air out of the tires and i’d start to feel like i was just connecting the boring dots. while writing, i’ve also had to be aware that there someday might <i>be</i> an <i>episode nine</i> so i can’t go wrecking the timelines before i get there.</p><p><b>What were the rocks and the gas pump that Emily fell in love with meant to represent?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ekaneff/\">Ekaneff</a></i><br/>she was learning how to love, and like all of us, in her youth she gravitated to a bunch of individuals that were wrong for her.</p><p><b>Aside from the ability to release more frequently, is there something about the episodic structure that you prefer/appreciate, as opposed to creating one larger feature-length film?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/siddfinch1/\">SiddFinch1</a></i><br/>there’s just more freedom. the traditional running time of a feature film, 90 to 120 minutes, is a totally arbitrary number.</p><p><b>Have you ever considered writing a <i>World of Tomorrow</i> book or graphic novel?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/stupode/\">Jay Smith</a></i><br/>the earliest ideas for <i>world of tomorrow</i> were sloshing around in a graphic novel called <i>the end of the world</i> that came out in 2013. but i don’t have any talent or much confidence in making another book like that. it’s a different world. when i look at someone like chris ware and then look at something like <i>the end of the world</i>, it’s like, “wow, baby made a mess”.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>What attracted you to the unique style [of minimalist stick figures]? Is there a sense of intimacy that you feel you can achieve with this simplicity?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/evan64aw/\">Evan Whitford</a></i><br/>when i was little, before i wanted to make movies i wanted to be a newspaper cartoonist. i think my drawings today might have more in common with newspaper comics than the sort of characters you usually see in animation. comic-strip panels were always composed in a very reserved way because they were generally intended to be skimmed. you needed to be able to read the strip in five seconds so you could be off to read the sports pages and obituaries. the comics pages were also under constant size and space restrictions. so they were minimal by design and the artists reduced their characters to only their most essential parts. there was no room for fussing. charles schulz said “i only draw what’s necessary”. and that’s actually incredibly hard to do. you’re accomplishing so much more with so much less.</p><p>i’ve also found that if there’s a scene that’s not playing right and bothering me, most of the time it’s because my composition was too cluttered. i almost always find myself removing things from the frame and trying to pare it down to only what’s necessary. very rarely do i ever think ‘i need to add more stuff in here’. because this shot is only five seconds long and i want you to be looking over <i>here</i> when this moment happens and this character says something, and if you’re distracted by this other flickering junk i put in the corner it’s going to throw everything off.</p><p><b>Animation-aside, which creative medium do you resonate with the most?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/brando98/\">Bronkdan</a></i><br/>music.</p><p><b>How much did you pull from real-life experiences to make <i>It’s Such A Beautiful Day</i>, if any? What research did you conduct into memory?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/gunnarsizemore/\"><i>Gunnar Sizemore</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidsigura/\"><i>David Sigura</i></a>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/micahsmith1510/\">Micah Smith</a></i><br/>whenever i got a little stuck writing <i>it’s such a beautiful day</i>, i’d go back and reread my journal and pull more things out of it. dreams, conversations, small scenes. reading the journal now, it seems like i stole something from it every few pages. i also heavily researched neurological problems. it’s never said in the movie what exactly’s going on with bill, but i needed there to be a real diagnosis to base the medical writing on. so all the things he’s going through are real treatments or symptoms based on an actual condition. i didn’t want to ever come out and say, “he’s got terminal brain clouds”, or whatever in the movie, because then it becomes a “brain-cloud movie”, and that’s too easy for the audience to compartmentalize and distance themselves from… “brain clouds are so rare, that will never happen to me”. but not being told exactly what’s wrong with bill might help make the story more relatable and universal.</p><p><b>In what ways have you kept your mind fresh creatively? How do you keep yourself from slipping into complacency?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/watchmoviez/\"><i>Watchmoviez</i></a>,<i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/drewrushline/\">Drew’s reviews</a></i><br/>most creative blocks or stagnation come from anxiety, second-guessing and doubt. over the years i’ve learned to just sort of calm down and trust myself more. it’s like the old aesop fable: when you stop thrashing around in the water, the water becomes clearer and you can see more. if a scene isn’t working right, i can more easily chill out about it these days and trust that i’ll eventually figure it out—because i’ve figured these sorts of things out a hundred times before and i know by now that i’m not the sort of person who’s just going to allow a scene that isn’t working to remain in the movie. there’s a little more panic about that sort of thing when you’re young: “oh no, the movie sucks right now, will it always suck?!” i’ve reached the point where i know that i will not let it suck. and that sort of thinking allows all the movie gears to turn more easily.</p><p><b>Do you have a specific thematic, emotional or other miscellaneous motive in mind when including classical music pieces?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/darthgamer/\">James Y. Lee</a></i><br/>when i’m listening to music and suddenly the right piece arrives, it’s usually blindingly obvious to me: there’s just no doubt this needs to be in the movie somehow. it’s like the idea has always existed and i’ve just finally uncovered it. it’s the same with writing. when the right thing floats along, it is striking and obvious and into the pile of notes it goes.</p><p><b>How much of your animation style lends itself to experimentation, such as discovering new tricks and pretty shots, that is then discarded if you learn it doesn’t work as intended?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/adam44/\"><i>Adam</i></a>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chalkboards/\">Jacob</a></i><br/>i think i’m always experimenting. i figure if it doesn’t work, at least i’ve learned something.</p><p><b>What is the strangest compliment or critique you’ve gotten personally or of your work?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/notsomegoy/\">Elliot Taylor</a></i><br/>i’ve always remembered this one. <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1h0e\">i am so proud of you</a></i> came out a couple years after <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1h0y\">everything will be ok</a></i>. it was a continuation of that story, so it was basically the first time i had ever made a sequel. and <i>everything will be ok</i> had done really well when it came out. it won sundance and got all these great reviews. so <i>i am so proud of you</i> comes out and i remember reading this review that says, “<i>everything will be ok</i> was probably my favorite animated short of all time. it honestly changed my life. it was funny, sad, beautiful and just so wonderful. <i>everything will be ok</i>, boy did i love it. incredible. two thumbs up. truly, best thing ever. wow. so, unfortunately, its sequel, <i>i am so proud of you</i>, just feels like more of the same.”</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Are there any pieces of fiction that have influenced your work that we probably wouldn’t think of?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/gyaniwasp/\"><i>Gyani Wasp</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mikape/\"><i>Mikolaj Perzyna</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aaronmcmillan/\"><i>Aaron McMillan</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/harrisonisalive/\"><i>Harrison</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/myweebacademia/\"><i>Axel</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cringetacular/\"><i>Cringetacular</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/the25centman/\"><i>The25centman</i></a>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hunterguidry/\">Hunter Guidry</a></i><br/>one thing that pops to mind is <i>the phantom tollbooth</i>. my favorite children’s books were the ones with all the fun metaphors and clever wordplay. when i was plotting out <i>episode two</i> i wanted to lean into that, where visiting different sections of emily’s brain would be like milo visiting the land of math, the land of letters, the land of sound, with different looks and logic to it. so we had the bog of realism, glimmers of hope, broken memories, the logic center, and all the stuff in triangle land and square land. i guess that’s a lot but i wish there had been a bit more.</p><p><b>How did your friends and family respond to the “my anus is bleeding” part of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1gZU\"><i>Rejected</i></a>?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/alextatterson/\">Alex Tatterson</a></i><br/>they were pretty used to me by then.</p><p><b>Do you know of the work of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Doki66\">David Firth</a>, the internet animator? His work is also surreal and has dark humor, but more sinister than whimsical. Would you ever consider making an animation in the realm of horror in future?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dynamitefilms/\">KEVIИ HДWKIИS</a></i><br/>i’m afraid i don’t know him. i’d love to make a horror movie. from a certain point of view though maybe it could be argued that most everything i’ve made is a sort of horror movie?</p><p><b>My first tattoo is of Billy from <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1h0I\"><i>Billy’s Balloon</i></a> hanging from his ankle and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. How do you feel about people having your work tattooed and do you have any ink from other creatives that have meant something to you?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/eliasel/\">Elias</a></i><br/>it<i> really</i> fucking enrages me when people get my stuff tattooed on them. no just kidding. mostly i feel embarrassed but i’m glad you haven’t changed your mind about it yet. sometimes i wonder how many people have.</p><p><b>Have you ever thought about directing live action?</b> —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/abeermuh/\"><i>Abeer</i></a>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nrt/\">Noah Thompson</a></i><br/>yes.</p><p><b>Is there an update on your feature film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ixqm\">Antarctica</a></i>?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bamsarnett/\">Rylan California</a></i><br/>it’s one of many things swirling around.</p><p><b>Will you do a remake of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/22Wu\">Robocop</a></i> and why not next year?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sosimomonon/\">Simon</a></i><br/>no, because <i>robocop</i><i></i> is already sort of perfect.</p><p><b>Do you ever see yourself directing a large studio film? Or working with a large team to make something with a higher budget, maybe through a crowd-funded project? Or do you just strongly prefer working on your own?</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/vteyshev/\">Vteyshev</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/monotoneduck/\">Monotone Duck</a></i><br/>sure. i’ve never preferred working on my own at all. it was usually just the only way to ever get anything made. i haven’t had the funding to pay a big crew, or really much of a crew at all. there’s the old saying: you can make something good, you can make it fast, and you can make it cheap, but you can only pick two. if you make it good and fast it won’t be cheap, if you make it cheap and fast it won’t be good, etc. so my only route in hoping to make something good and cheap has been to totally forget about making it fast.</p><p><b>What did you find digital animation added or took away from your work, and what did those changes do for your storytelling?

I can’t believe you’re going to read this. I am currently filled with an unparalleled amount of joy, wow. This is a long shot but here I go. I’m 17 and your (self-proclaimed) biggest fan. I’ve seen <i>It&rsquo;s Such a Beautiful Day</i> eight times now and every single time I pick up on more details. I’ve watched a few of your interviews and in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiTxy35e7OA\">AFS</a> one about <i>Rejected</i> you said that the louder you play a movie, the funnier it is. On my seventh watch of <i>It’s Such a Beautiful Day</i> I hooked my laptop up to three huge speakers and I must say—you were so, so right. I made a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/xzTZkHlH-bk\">video essay</a> about the movie. Lol, I’m not sure if this will get to you but Michael Jordan once said something about missing shots or not taking shots or maybe about tequila, I am unsure but I know it was important. Thanks MJ. Not you, Mr Jackson. I’m sorry Ms. Jackson…</b></p><p><b>I actually do have a question, sorry about the rambling. Every single time I watch the guy at the payphone flip his pencil and go “fantastic, fantastic” I cry. And I think what really does it for me is that “we’ll finally have our day”. Earlier in the movie, Bill’s co-worker talks about how all of time is happening at once. So what I constantly ask myself is if the guy at the payphone is simultaneously having his day and waiting for it. And I’m no longer speaking to that one specific example or even to the movie as a whole but I guess I’m wondering if the idea of all events happening at once comforts you?</b></p><p><b>In <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>, Kurt Vonnegut writes: “The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist.” When I read this I immediately thought about your movie. I think the idea of all of time happening at once makes all of life feel less important but more special. You know? Anyway, I suppose I’d just like to know what inspired the lines about time in the office scene. This isn’t much of a question, more an incoherent ramble but thank you so, so much for all you’ve done. I feel so incredibly inspired and so deeply moved by your work and I know that so many people in this comment section and around the world would agree. I can’t believe I’ve been given the opportunity to ask something. It really is such a beautiful day. :)</b> —<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/eliosei/\">Eli Osei</a> (co-signed by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/vooder/\">Vooder</a>)</i><br/>that old guy at the payphone was someone i saw at the laundromat once and he borrowed my pencil and the whole thing just played out like in the movie. i just thought it was such a perfect little scene that i’d just witnessed. anyway, the idea of time being a landscape and everything taking place “at once” just came straight out of a science magazine. i don’t know how, but apparently it’s been more or less proven to be true? we perceive time in one direction, but the past and the future are always all around us. think of it as though we’re driving our car through a landscape. even though the mountains we saw ten minutes ago are behind us now, it doesn’t mean those mountains have ceased to exist. they’ve only ceased to exist from our point of view. we’ve only just driven past them. the mountains, like your childhood, are still going on back there. anyway, i had never heard of that before and thought it needed to be in a movie.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>Are you a fan of Kurt Vonnegut by any chance?

Before becoming a filmmaker, Hart spent her days with other people’s kids as a teacher; her 2016 debut, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bBq2\"><i>Miss Stevens</i></a>, stars Lily Rabe as a high-school educator, but her follow-up films have been wider-ranging, from <a href=\"https://boxd.it/g3wg\"><i>Fast Color</i></a> to this year’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dkxk\"><i>Stargirl</i></a>. Hart credits this genre-jumping to her absolute love of movies. “I don’t have a favorite genre. I love musicals, Westerns, crime dramas, coming-of-age movies, superhero movies. It was so fun getting to learn about how to create musical numbers in <i>Stargirl</i> and how to direct a car chase in <i>I’m Your Woman</i>.”</p><p>Horowitz, meanwhile, is known for producing <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/13f0\">The Kids Are All Right</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/a5fa\">La La Land</a></i>. Yes, he’s the “Guys, guys, I’m sorry, no, there’s a mistake” guy. Horowitz is <i>also</i> a Letterboxd member, and a hunt back through his diary reveals <a href=\"https://boxd.it/b9vs3\">the date he first watched <i>Moonlight</i></a>, along with his <a href=\"https://boxd.it/11F0q3\">wholesome</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1pqdzj\">reviews</a> of Julia’s films. “I always tried to remember to log my movies in so many different ways,” Horowitz explains, “and then once Letterboxd came out it was a very easy solution.”</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Horowitz keeps diligent lists of references for his <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JaNW\">upcoming</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/AKOY\">films</a>, years before they’re even announced. It’s here that the roots of <i>I’m Your Woman</i> are found, if you’re looking closely: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2rzU1\">a fateful viewing of Michael Mann’s <i>Thief</i></a> nearly seven years ago was the primary influence on <i>I’m Your Woman</i>, “especially Tuesday Weld’s character, and the moment where she is basically asked to leave the movie before James Caan burns everything to the ground,” he tells me. “Our hope with this movie was to follow some of the women in those movies that don’t necessarily get the spotlight and shift the gaze of the camera to follow this car as it drives away with her in it, instead of staying with the criminal of this movie.”</p><p>Hart picks up the thread, naming Diane Keaton in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aNK\"><i>The Godfather</i></a>, Ali MacGraw in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/22lS\"><i>The Getaway</i></a>, Theresa Russell in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1zgu\"><i>Straight Time</i></a>. “Those were interesting characters played by incredible actresses but they only have a handful of scenes so I loved the idea of exploring a woman in that world and time but telling the story through her perspective.”</p><p>Horowitz defines master filmmakers Sidney Lumet, Martin Ritt and Jonathan Demme as Hart’s “spirit animals”, for their humanist takes in multiple genres. A particular recommendation of a Lumet classic from an Amazon executive changed the way they looked at their writing. “<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1How\"><i>Running on Empty</i></a> has this great scene where they all sing [James Taylor’s] ‘Fire and Rain’ together. Originally in our script, the ‘Natural Woman’ scene was just [Jean] singing. After watching that movie it inspired us to consider what if the Cal character joins in with her? What happens to the moment if it becomes a bit more of a community moment?”</p><!--figure[3]--><p>When talking about their writing process, Horowitz admits that he always has his producer hat handy: “I’m never thinking about writing for the sake of writing. I’m always keeping how we make this thing in mind. Do we have too many extras? Is this location gettable? That can help me when we get into production because I’ve already considered some of those things, but I do wish sometimes that I could just sit down as Julia does and just write.” Once the duo makes it into production, Horowitz admits “[I] definitely put writer mode behind me, to the point where we’ll be on set and someone will ask me something about the script and I’ll be like ‘I don’t know, ask Julia’ and they’ll say ‘didn’t you write it too?!’”</p><p>However, Horowitz credits Hart as the “idea generator” of the two. The premise to have Jean struggling to connect with her adoptive baby was always part of the conception of the character, largely based on conversations Hart had with mothers, pre-lockdown. “It sometimes feels like Hollywood sees mothers as a monolith where there isn’t much nuance and subtlety, especially when it comes to negative feelings about motherhood, so they’re often shamed into not talking about them,” Julia laments. “It was really important for me to explore a side of motherhood that isn’t talked about as much and make sure that mothers know that they are seen and heard.”</p><p>The decision to have a baby (performed by brothers Justin and Jameson Charles) in almost every scene was a big risk, and not one Hart took lightly. “Movie people can think what they’re doing is very important, but there’s nothing more humbling than when you’re on a whole set with hundreds of people [and] you’re waiting for a baby’s dirty diaper to be changed. It made everything feel so real and immediate, so everyone on set really had to live in the moment and adapt. You prepare, and prepare, and prepare, but you have to throw out so much if the baby is sleeping instead of crying, or crying instead of smiling. I think it’s important to portray babies as real people, because as a society we often forget that.”</p><p>Lead actress Rachel Brosnahan came on as a producer many years after the script was already in Hart and Horowitz’s heads, but Hart explains that Brosnahan brought a history and interior life, “more in the wordless moments of acting than in dialogue itself.” Along the way, Jean meets Cal and Teri, who guide her to refuge. They’re the heart of the film, and Hart elaborates on their importance to the narrative: “they have been through the hell that Jean is currently going through and her circumstances force them to go through it again, but this time they have honesty, truth and love on their side. In watching Teri and Cal, Jean starts to understand what real love, family and support are.”</p><!--figure[4]--><p>When you examine Hart’s filmography, it’s impressive how productive she’s been in such a short time, releasing four films within five years, with those pre-schoolers under foot. Horowitz makes a comparison to a prolific filmmaker like Steven Soderbergh, who advises to “fail as fast as you can”. Horowitz acknowledges that “I don’t think we set out like, ‘we’re gonna have two children and we’re gonna make four films in five years.’ If we knew that we were gonna do that we would’ve said, ‘wow, that’s a little bit insane, maybe we shouldn’t do that!’” But they did, and the film world is richer for it.</p><p>We always like to ask about the film that made filmmakers want to become filmmakers, and Hart lands on <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JB8\"><i>All That Jazz</i></a>. “I’ve always been a fan of Bob Fosse since his [early] work. How he turned moving your body in a way that people haven’t really moved their bodies before into an empire is very inspiring. [Roy Scheider] is also my favorite actor, which doesn’t hurt. He’s so good.” Horowitz, meanwhile, is a huge fan of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b8e\"><i>Back to the Future</i></a>. “That was the movie when I was a kid that just opened my eyes to the power of movies, to make you obsess and dream about what other movies could be.”</p><p>“I remember going with my parents to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aYI\"><i>Back to the Future Part II</i></a> on the Friday night it opened and when we got there it was sold out. We saw some other movie, but I was so upset so all I was thinking about was <i>Back to the Future Part II</i>. As we were leaving the movie theater, I saw through the back little window of the screen where <i>Back to the Future Part II</i> was playing and watched the end scene where Marty is standing in the rain and someone comes and gives him a letter. I did not sleep the entire night. That feeling of anticipation and imagination defines the way I like to look at movies and the way they can make me feel.” A subsequent look at Horowitz’s Letterboxd diary reveals that this conversation perhaps <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1tgJ9N\">inspired</a> him to take a trip back in time the following day.</p>"

The legendary actor has kept himself busy, and I know this because I have seen most of his filmography—41 films and two series—in the span of a single month. I adore Malkovich, always have, and I came out of this experience with a deeper admiration for him, and with some thoughts about his unique, remarkable skills as an actor. (And, I had a really good time.)</p><p>Allow me to begin by saying that John Malkovich is the best part of every movie he is in. No matter the movie, Malkovich will always steal the spotlight, and he can turn a good movie into a masterpiece, or an average movie that wouldn’t catch anyone’s attention into one worth watching, if only to see him do his thing.</p><p>He’s starred in movies that are considered masterpieces by many: <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ahu\">Being John Malkovich</a></i> (1999), <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Yi\">The Killing Fields</a></i> (1984) and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1X4i\">Empire of the Sun</a></i> (1987). Movies that may be considered the opposite of masterpieces, like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/feR8\">Supercon</a></i> (2018), <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/26Fs\">Eragon</a></i> (2006) and the most recent <i>Ava</i> (2020), and he’s also starred in some gems that I knew nothing about but am glad to have discovered, such as <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/469A\">The Convent</a></i> (1995), <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/VUk\">Eleni</a></i> (1985) and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/J18\">The Ogre</a></i> (1996). Malkovich has brought to life iconic characters including <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Zb6\">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UZg\">Tom Ripley</a>, Hercule Poirot (in BBC’s <i>The ABC Murders</i>), the artist <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1nOk\">Gustav Klimt</a>, and several of David Lynch’s people, in the short film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/eMGm\">Psychogenic Fugue</a></i> (2016).</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Malkovich has received two Academy Award nominations, for <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1PDO\">Places in the Heart</a></i> (1984), in which he played Edna’s lodger, the solitary yet kind Mr. Will, and for <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YOw\">In the Line of Fire</a></i> (1993), where he played the complete opposite: the psychotic Mitch Leary, determined to kill the President of the United States. Though Malkovich is not a classic action-film actor, his work in that genre is driven by logic, intellect and emotion, and the delicacy that he employs to challenge concepts of masculinity and keep us guessing. His soft and collected voice threatening Clint Eastwood over the phone is scarier and more effective than a deeper one would have been.</p><p>That voice. Malkovich has admitted that he hates the sound of it, that he would always avoid listening to it, just like so many actors avoid watching their own films, but I’m bewitched by his voice and I could never get enough of it. It can be tender, sweet and calming, seductive when the role requires it, and terrifying. With that versatility, it’s not surprising that he has done some narrating work as well, for films including Paul Newman’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/y9A\">The Glass Menagerie</a></i> (1987) and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/210u\">Alive</a></i> (1993).</p><p>Malkovich is at his best when seduction and villainy combine, as they do in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29r4\">Dangerous Liaisons</a></i> (1988). Vicomte Sébastien de Valmont has been performed by many actors over the years, but I find Malkovich’s take to be the most memorable and exquisite. He captures perfectly the depravity and evilness of Valmont, but also the nuances, his journey from womanizer to man genuinely in love and, ultimately, his tragic redemption. He even brings a comedic aspect to the character that adds more depth and dimension.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Valmont is an awful human being, a monster even, and yet, every time I watch this movie, I find myself fascinated by his mastery of the deception, his sensuality and complete control of the situation, until the situation is “beyond his control”. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinephile24/film/dangerous-liaisons/\">In her review</a> of the film, Catherine Stebbins calls John Malkovich “a sexual force of nature”, and I completely agree. If you want to see more of Malkovich’s sensual side, other notable mentions include <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it\">The Sheltering Sky</a></i> (1990), <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/38yU\">The Object of Beauty</a></i> (1991) and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1fkw\">Beyond the Clouds</a></i> (1995).</p><p>And then there’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ahu\">Being John Malkovich</a></i> (1999), in which ‘John Horatio Malkovich’ displays so many facets of his craft. The fictionalized Malkovich is possessed by different characters, one of them a woman. Catherine Keener’s character falls in love with a subtly different version of Malkovich, when he is a vessel for Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Even though Lotte doesn’t have full control of Malkovich, he uses his femininity to bring the character-inside-the-character to center stage, delivering a subtle-yet-perfect performance. Even when we don’t see Lotte, we know she’s there.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Not many actors could pull this off as brilliantly as John Malkovich does. To be fair, not many actors have been given the chance that Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman gave Malkovich: a film with his own name in the title.</p><p>I’ve discussed some of the most well-known of Malkovich’s performances, but I’d like to mention an overlooked one that I found heartbreaking and noteworthy. I didn’t know of the existence of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/J18\">The Ogre</a></i> (1996) until I took a closer look at Malkovich’s filmography. It’s not without its flaws, but I found myself absorbed in the fairy-tale story of Abel, a naïve French prisoner of war who is taken to Nazi Germany and used to recruit children for Hitler’s Youth. Once again, the actor’s duality is on display, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1rFX7X\">as Evan writes</a> in his Letterboxd review: “Malkovich is both queasy and endearing as the (ig)noble simp who just wants to save the babies.” <i>The Ogre</i> tells a tragic story, but thanks to Malkovich’s tenderness, we can’t help but have sympathy for his character. At times it reminded me of the innocence of Lennie in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Yfm\">Of Mice and Men</a></i> (1992), another of the actor’s more noteworthy performances.</p><p>One of Malkovich’s great contributions to cinema is elevating an average movie just by being in it. One such role is as English conman Alan Conway in the bizarre true story, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1PnG\">Colour Me Kubrick</a></i> (2005). Malkovich admitted in an <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/john-malkovich-space-force-interview\">interview</a> that he thought his performance was good, and I agree. If there’s one reason to watch that film, it’s to see Malkovich playing an eccentric conman who poses as Stanley Kubrick, using different voices and accents. As <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7u61x\">TajLV writes</a>, “if there were anything to commend this film other than Malkovich, I’d happily rate it higher”.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>One fun fact: I sometimes forget John Malkovich is American. Maybe it’s because he has starred in many European productions—out of the 41 films I watched, 18 were European. Malkovich is of European descent, has lived in France for a decade and speaks fluent French, which allowed him to star as the mysterious Baron de Charlus in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/KJ6\">Time Regained</a></i> (1999), with entirely French dialogue. He also delivers lines in French and Portuguese in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/3jHI\">A Talking Picture</a></i> (2003) by Manoel de Oliveira.</p><p>You’ve probably heard Malkovich use words, expressions and even entire lines of French dialogue on more than one occasion. He does this often, which gives him a certain European vibe, consistent with his own character, mannerisms and dress sense—elements that he sometimes brings to his characters. Maybe that’s the reason he has played so many intellectuals and artists: professors, scientists, detectives, painters, writers, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hPw\">a scientist <i>and</i> a robot</a>, and even the Pope… It seems there’s nothing John Malkovich can’t do, including directing.</p><p>To end my marathon, I watched his directorial debut, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1D3k\">The Dancer Upstairs</a></i> (2002), an assured movie adapted from a novel about the Maoist uprising in Peru in the 1980s, starring Javier Bardem. It was a nice surprise, and a strong start to what could have been a career as a film director, if not for the fact that he doesn’t have the patience to do it again. I recently read an interview where Edgar Wright revealed advice he always gives to directors, which is to make their second movie the one that will define them. I wonder if we will ever see John Malkovich’s second film, but for now, I hope he keeps gifting us with more unforgettable performances. At least we know that in the distant future, along with all the movies he has already appeared in, people will enjoy a never-seen-before performance when Robert Rodríguez’s short <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/john-malkovich-and-robert-rodriguez-have-made-a-movie-n-1743390289\"><i>100 years</i></a> is released in 2115.</p><p>If there’s one thing I have learnt after watching most of his filmography, it’s that John Malkovich is one of the best and most versatile actors of our time, with the most unique voice I have heard in cinema, and with a rich filmography that encompasses every genre. And he’s not only a brilliant actor, but also someone I find personally fascinating. I truly find comfort in him. I hope we all get to enjoy his art for years to come, because his talent is limitless and I know he still has so much more to give. John Malkovich deserves all the praise for being a force of nature in the theater and film industry for over 40 years.</p>"

As <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chainsawmasacre/film/leap-of-faith-william-friedkin-on-the-exorcist/\">ChainsawMasacre writes on Letterboxd</a>, “his mind and memory is still like a steel trap”. Philippe, a Swiss-born cinephile-centric doco filmmaker who’s covered everything from zombie movies to George Lucas, captures Friedkin’s contagious ranconteuring in all its prickly, contradictory, exuberant bluster. It’s so absorbing that from the moment he opens his mouth, you’ll be hooked in and suddenly an hour has vanished without you even realizing.</p><p>It’s true that considerable swathes of <i>Leap of Faith</i> may feel like old news to Friedkin/Exorcist obsessives—anyone who’s listened to the DVD audio commentary, read <i>The Friedkin Connection</i>, or watched Francesco Zippel’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jpXO\">Friedkin Uncut</a></i> will be familiar with some of these stories. But Philippe’s incisive, thoughtful, highly accessible approach, excavating deeper than anecdotal interest but eschewing academic stuffiness, makes the documentary as much of value to newcomers as to seasoned fans. “The intersection of influences between music, film, fine art and personal travesty made me admire Friedkin on a whole new level”, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/databaseanimal/film/leap-of-faith-william-friedkin-on-the-exorcist/\">writes Databaseanimal</a>.</p><p><b>How many times have you seen <i>The Exorcist</i>, and on average how often would you need to rewatch a film in prep?<br/></b><i>Alexandre O. Philippe: </i>You have to watch a film over and over and over again. I can’t tell you generally how many times I’ve watched <i>The Exorcist</i> but I can tell you when I was preparing for my interviews with Bill, I watched it every day for 30 days straight. That’s part of the process.</p><p><b><i>Leap of Faith</i> is a bit of a departure from your previous two deep-dives—<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kJ18\">Memory: The Origins of Alien</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ce9a\">78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene</a></i>—in that you’re only talking to one interviewee, and that interviewee happens to be William Friedkin. What was that experience like?<br/></b>It’s wonderful. It’s really hard to put into words how incredible it’s been to spend that amount of time with him. Getting my own personal masterclass with him is invaluable. There’s no film school in the world that can give you that experience. It’s been really something.</p><p><b>Did spending that extended time reveal something about Friedkin that you weren’t aware of prior to shooting?<br/></b>Oh sure, that’s the beauty of that extensive of an interview—six days—and multiple conversations in between. Without giving it away, in the final sequence when he’s talking about Kyoto Zen Gardens… this is the stuff you can only get from someone like Friedkin once the comfort level is there, once you’re in the groove of conversation. It’s an aspect of his personality we’ve never seen before.</p><p>We all know him as a storyteller and a showman but he’s probably been very guarded in the past. There’s a certain amount of vulnerability even when he talks about the climax of <i>The Exorcist</i>, and how much to this day he’s not sure he understands some of the choices he made shooting that scene. That’s a remarkable thing to say about one of the most iconic scenes in the history of movies.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>I could listen to him speak for hours. Did you challenge him at any point?<br/></b>I definitely pushed him as far as I could. The whole sequence around the climax of <i>The Exorcist</i> that I was just talking about. There’s only about three minutes of that in the film but we talked about that scene for an hour and a half. I kept pushing and pushing him because I didn’t understand where he was coming from. I feel as a film fan that I understand that scene. For me, Father Karras sacrifices himself. It’s an act of complete selflessness. But he kept going back to the idea of suicide and that suicide in the Catholic Church is a sin and how he didn’t understand it. And that’s why you see him a little on edge during that scene. It was very important to go there.</p><p><b>I love the obsessive detail that goes into your examination of the creative process. Was there any detail—something that is interesting in and of itself—that you left out?<br/></b>We had a really great conversation around <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/carlos-kleiber/\">Carlos Kleiber</a>, one of the conductors he admires the most, who essentially taught him to direct in metaphors. It’s a fascinating conversation. We actually built a scene around that and it just didn’t work with the film. There’s a point in any film where it becomes autonomous and its own entity in a way and you have to listen and pay attention to what the film tells you it wants to be.</p><p>We also had a great conversation around his first documentary <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/3q6O\">The People vs. Paul Crump</a></i>, and the technique which he used of slapping him in his cell on death row, which is the same technique he used for Bill O’Malley in <i>The Exorcist</i>. I had a long conversation with [executive producer] Karyn Kusama about this and we felt it was a little too over-the-top to go there and it wasn’t necessary to take the film to that level so we eventually left it out.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Friedkin talks about <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1xFM\">The Brink’s Job</a></i> at one point, which is great to hear as it’s probably my favorite underrated Friedkin film. What’s yours?<br/></b>[Laughs] If you’re talking underrated or one that’s not much talked about, for me it’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1RN2\"><i>Bug</i></a>. <i>Bug</i> is ummm… [pauses]</p><p><b>What <i>can</i> you say about <i>Bug</i>?<br/></b>I mean honestly, truly, have you ever seen performances that pushed to the very edge of what’s even reasonable to expect or see from actors? It’s mind-blowing stuff. How does he even get performances like these? I mean they are wonderful actors but Michael Shannon and Ashley Judd, like, really… Like, <i>really</i>? You know what I mean? That’s Billy.</p><p>To me, you’re talking about Billy when he was in his early 70s when he made that film, a filmmaker who’s still really interested in pushing the envelope and going as far as he possibly can. It’s absolutely remarkable and I wish we talked more about that film.</p><p><b>Tell us about one ‘holy grail’ film or filmmaker you’d like to cover.<br/></b>The one I really want most to make a film about, and I will, is <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2apI\">Vertigo</a></i>. To go back to Hitchcock. I definitely have a healthy obsession with that film—have had since I was a kid. I love melodrama, and it’s the greatest melodrama ever made. I can’t think of a better film for my money from anywhere. It’s a glorious, glorious piece of filmmaking, but it’s also a very complex, tortured, complicated film that alienates some people.</p><p>I was on TCM a couple years ago as Ben Mankiewicz’s co-host on “50 Years of Alfred Hitchcock”. We did 24 movies together and when it came to <i>Vertigo</i> we had a fun conversation because he’s not a fan. He’s basically like “what’s the big deal about that film?” That really fascinates me. That’s a really amazing thing and he’s not the only person I highly respect who said that to me. I’d love to not only do a deep dive into <i>Vertigo</i> but also what’s so polarizing about it. That’d be fun to do that.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>In<i> Leap of Faith</i>, Friedkin talks a lot about non-horror-specific aspects, such as grace notes, and the mysterious, magical aspects of filmmaking that can’t be easily explained. What movies are you drawn to but can’t explain completely through the technique and science of filmmaking?<br/></b>Any great work of art, not just film, that has a lasting impact on us and on society, works in ways that are much more mysterious than not. You can explain away the many different tangible reasons why <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ab2\">Psycho</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2awY\">Alien</a></i> and <i>The Exorcist</i> continue to have an impact, and had a massive impact on audiences when they came out. But for every tangible reason or every fact that you can provide, there are a million mysteries as well.</p><p>I’m much more interested in the mysteries of the creative process than I’m interested in the behind-the-scenes anecdotes or little tidbits of movie history. Because you will never get to the bottom of it and that’s the real beauty of it. And the lesson to learn from that is there’s nothing to do beyond just being in awe of it.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>What’s a documentary that uses the form in a way that’s inspiring to you, or one that made you want to pursue this form?<br/></b>I don’t watch a ton of documentaries. I don’t like the term ‘documentary’. With that asterisk out of the way, there are a number of documentaries I absolutely adore and filmmakers that are pushing the form that are remarkable. I think of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/allan-king-1/\">Allan King</a>, one of the great documentarians.</p><p>There is one that, formally speaking, absolutely blew me away and is very hard to watch. It’s called <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/gVoq\">Caniba</a></i>. It’s a documentary about this French-Japanese man who killed and ate one of his classmates. He did a whole comic book on it, and his brother is equally disturbed. It’s one of the few films, along with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lcS\">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a></i>, where I had to literally stop halfway through ’cos I just couldn’t handle it. The remarkable thing about this film is that the entire film is extreme close-ups. You’re watching basically his face and his brother’s face in extreme close-up the entire film and it makes you absolutely nauseous.</p><p>The formal choice that was made, in committing to that, it’s so much more horrendous and horrible than what’s on the periphery of the frame. You’re trapped in the geography of that face and you can’t get out. I’m not sure if ‘exciting’ is the best word I can use here, but to say this kind of approach excites me when I see a documentary filmmaker doing this, is accurate.</p><p><b>How do you spell that? I’m going to put it on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/naturebean/watchlist/\">my watchlist</a>.<br/></b>C-A-N-I-B-A. Good luck watching it my friend [laughs]. Don’t eat while you’re watching it.</p><p><b>What films have you caught during the pandemic and completely loved, old or new?<br/></b>I watch almost exclusively the Criterion Channel. They’re the gold standard. I don’t even know where to begin. Recently I just watched the three Joseph Losey/Harold Pinter collaborations: <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/VAa\">The Servant</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2AHS\">Accident</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1b7y\">The Go-Between</a></i>. I’ve always been a huge fan of Harold Pinter but what Joseph Losey has done with those three films is astonishing. <i>The Go-Between,</i> especially. Wow. That film just floored me.</p><p>They had a whole sidebar on Western noir films, and I discovered a bunch of incredible titles like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/18BU\">Station West</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mfe\">Blood on the Moon</a></i> with Robert Mitchum, which is an absolutely magnificent film. Some of the early Douglas Sirk movies. I can watch that stuff all day.</p><p>Oh there’s another one I would like to recommend as it is a criminally not just underrated, but completely under-the-radar film: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3j76\"><i>Sun Don’t Shine</i></a>.</p><p><b>Kate Lyn Sheil’s performance is amazing in it.<br/></b>Oh my god. Why didn’t she run away with the Screen Actors Guild Award, Oscars, Golden Globes? Like seriously. Some of the recent nominations Meryl Streep has been getting, like give me a break. It’s not even close. It’s not even in the same ballpark [laughs]. It’s really one of those rare performances that I think about, like Isabelle Huppert in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2886\">The Piano Teacher</a></i>. Once in a generation you see something like this and you go “Holy cow, what a performance”. It does not exist on DVD or Blu-ray and it kills me. I want that film in my collection so badly.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>Maybe this will be the thing that will get them to push it out on physical media.<br/></b>I’m trying, I’m working with them, and I’ve done some with them. I need to send them an email and say “Can you please do something about this?”.</p><p><b>What’s a film that you were cold on first viewing but has grown on you with repeat viewings?<br/></b>The first one that comes to mind is <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b2A\">Donnie Darko</a></i>. I really hated the film the first time around, and it’s weird because there was always this voice at the back of my head that kept saying “watch it again”. I did and it completely blew me away the second time around. Often I will give a film a second chance. Especially when I know the film is well-respected. There are films where you can intellectually understand why the film is respected, but you don’t connect with the film.</p><p>I’ll tell you one that I’m really looking forward to giving a second chance. Not because I hated it but it left me really underwhelmed. A film that everybody loves: <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/d6bE\">Moonlight</a></i>. I also do remember when I was watching it, actively thinking I was not in the right frame of mind for that film. Sometimes you just have to recognize that. Sometimes you can be watching a romantic comedy but what you’re really craving is a film noir. That’s really not going to work.</p><p>So we’ll see, we’ll talk about it after I’ve watched it a second time. And hopefully it will be a revelation. There’s nothing better for me than these moments when you watch something the second time that didn’t work and you go “Holy cow this is great”. That’s an awesome thing to experience.</p>"

Of more concern to the less youthful among us is how quaintly it is perceived, as if it harkens back to the dawn of cinema or something. “God, I miss good old-fashioned adventure movies,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jurassicstark/film/the-mummy-1999/2/\">bemoans Holly-Beth</a>. “I have so many fond memories of watching this on TV with my family countless times growing up,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jesslsamess/film/the-mummy-1999/\">recalls Jess</a>. “A childhood classic,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/drivefiction19/film/the-mummy-1999/\">notes Simon</a>.</p><p>As alarming as it is to see such wistful nostalgia for what was a cutting-edge, special-effects-laden contemporary popcorn hit, it <i>has</i> been twenty-one years since the film was released, so anyone currently in their early 30s would’ve encountered the film at just the right age for it to imprint deeply in their hearts. This has helped make it a <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/raiders-of-the-lost-ark/\">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i> for a specific Letterboxd demographic.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Sommers took plenty of inspiration from the <i>Indiana Jones</i> series for his take on <i>The Mummy</i> (the original <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mummy/\">1932 film</a>, also with a 3.3 average, is famously sedate), but for ten-year-olds in 1999, it may have been their only exposure to such pulpy derring-do. And when you consider that popcorn cinema would soon be taken over by interconnected on-screen universes populated by spandex-clad superheroes, the idea that <i>The Mummy</i> is an old-fashioned movie is easier to comprehend.</p><p>However, for all its throwbackiness, beholding <i>The Mummy</i> from the perspective of 2020 reveals it to have more to say about the future of cinema than the past. 1999 was a big year for movies, often considered one of the all-time best, but the legacy of <i>The Mummy</i> ties it most directly to two of that year’s other biggest hits: <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace/\">Star Wars: Episode One—The Phantom Menace</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-matrix/\">The Matrix</a></i>. These three blockbusters represented a turning point for the biggest technological advancement to hit the cinematic art-form since the introduction of sound: computer-generated imagery, aka CGI. The technique had been widely used from 1989’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-abyss/\">The Abyss</a></i> onwards, and took significant leaps forward with movies such as <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/terminator-2-judgment-day/\">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></i> (1991), <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jurassic-park/\">Jurassic Park</a></i> (1993) and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/starship-troopers/\">Starship Troopers</a></i> (1997), but the three 1999 films mentioned above signified a move into the era when blockbusters began to be <i>defined</i> by their CGI.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>A year before <i>The Mummy</i>, Sommers had creatively utilised CGI in his criminally underrated sci-fi action thriller <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/deep-rising/\">Deep Rising</a></i> (another film that deserves a higher average Letterboxd rating, just sayin’), and he took this approach to the next level with <i>The Mummy</i>. While some of the CGI in <i>The Mummy</i> doesn’t hold up as well as the technopunk visuals presented in <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>The Mummy</i> showed how effective the technique could be in an historical setting—the expansiveness of ancient Egypt depicted in the movie is magnificent, and the iconic rendering of Imhotep’s face in the sand storm proved to be an enduringly creepy image. Not to mention those scuttling scarab beetles.</p><p>George Lucas wanted to test the boundaries of the technique with his insanely anticipated new <i>Star Wars</i> film after dipping his toe in the digital water with the special editions of the original trilogy. Beyond set expansions and environments, a bunch of big creatures and cool spaceships, his biggest gambit was Jar Jar Binks, a major character rendered entirely through CGI. And we all know how that turned out.</p><!--figure[4]--><p>Sommers arguably presented a much more effective CGI character in the slowly regenerating resurrected Imhotep. Jar Jar’s design was “bigger” than the actor playing him on set, Ahmed Best. Which is to say, Jar Jar took up more space on screen than Best. But with the zombie-ish Imhotep, Sommers (ably assisted by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, who also worked on the <i>Star Wars</i> films) used CGI to create <i>negative</i> space, an effect impossible to achieve with practical make-up—large parts of the character were <i>missing</i>. It was an indelible visual concept that has been recreated many times since, but Sommers pioneered its usage here, and it contributed greatly to the popcorn horror threat posed by the character.</p><p>Sommers, generally an unfairly overlooked master of fun popcorn spectacle (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra/\">G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</a></i> is good, guys), deserves more credit for how he creatively utilized CGI to elevate the storytelling in <i>The Mummy</i>. But CGI isn’t the main reason the film works—it’s a spry, light-on-its-feet adventure that presents an iconic horror property in an entertaining and adventurous new light. And it happens to feature a ridiculously attractive cast all captured just as their pulchritudinous powers were peaking.</p><!--figure[5]--><p>A rising star at the time, Brendan Fraser was mostly known for comedic performances, and although he’d proven himself very capable with his shirt off in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/george-of-the-jungle/\">George of the Jungle</a></i> (1997), he wasn’t necessarily at the top of anyone’s list for action-hero roles. But he is superlatively charming as dashing American adventurer Rick O’Connell. His fizzy chemistry with Weisz, playing the brilliant-but-clumsy Egyptologist Evie Carnahan, makes the film a legitimate romantic caper. The role proved to be a breakout for Weisz, then perhaps best known for playing opposite Keanu Reeves in the trouble-plagued action flop <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/chain-reaction/\">Chain Reaction</a></i>, or for her supporting role in the Liv Tyler vehicle <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/stealing-beauty/\">Stealing Beauty</a></i>.</p><p>“90s Brendan Fraser is what Chris Pratt wishes he was,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jurassicstark/film/the-mummy-1999/2/\">argues Holly-Beth</a>. “Please come back to us, Brendaddy. We need you.” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jmfilms123/film/the-mummy-1999/\">begs Joshhh</a>. “I’d like to thank Rachel Weisz for playing an integral role in my sexual awakening,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/iaiaiand/film/the-mummy-1999/\">offers Sree</a>.</p><p>Then there’s Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, a member of the Medjai, a sect dedicated to preventing Imhotep’s tomb from being discovered, and Patricia Velásquez as Anck-su-namun, Imhotep’s cursed lover. Both stupidly good-looking. Heck, Imhotep himself (South African Arnold Vosloo, coming across as Billy Zane’s more rugged brother), is one of the hottest horror villains in the history of cinema.</p><p>“Remember when studio movies were sexy?” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/colinmclaughlin/film/the-mummy-1999/\">laments Colin McLaughlin</a>. We do Colin, we do.</p><!--figure[6]--><p>Sommers directed a somewhat bloated sequel, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mummy-returns/\">The Mummy Returns</a></i>, in 2001, which featured the cinematic debut of one Dwayne Johnson. His character got a spin-off movie the following year (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-scorpion-king/\">The Scorpion King</a></i>), which generated a bunch of DTV sequels of its own, and is now the subject of a Johnson-produced reboot. Brendan Fraser came back for a third film in 2008, the Rob Cohen-directed <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor/\">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a>.</i> Weisz declined to participate, and was replaced by Maria Bello.</p><p>Despite all the follow-ups, and the enduring love for the first Sommers film, there has been a sadly significant dearth of movies along these lines in the two decades since it was released. The less said about 2017 reboot <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mummy-2017/\">The Mummy</a></i> (which was supposed to kick-off a new Universal Monster shared cinematic universe, and took a contemporary, action-heavy approach to the property), the better.</p><!--figure[7]--><p>For a long time, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tylermkw/list/indiana-jones-shit/\">adventure films</a> were Hollywood’s bread and butter, but they’re surprisingly thin on the ground these days. So it makes a certain amount of sense that nostalgia for the 1999 <i>The Mummy</i> continues to grow. You could argue that many of the superhero films that dominate multiplexes count as adventure movies, but nobody really sees them that way—they are their own genre.</p><p>There are, however, a couple of films on the horizon that could help bring back old-school cinematic adventure. One is the long-planned—and finally actually shot—adaptation of the <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/b5Dy\">Uncharted</a></i> video-game franchise, starring Tom Holland. The games borrow a lot from the <i>Indiana Jones</i> films, and it’ll be interesting to see how much that manifests in the adaptation.</p><p>Then there’s Letterboxd favorite David Lowery’s forever-upcoming medieval adventure drama <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kuy2\">The Green Knight</a></i>, starring Dev Patel and Alicia Vikander (who herself <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bgbA\">recently rebooted</a> another video-game icon, Lara Croft). Plus they are still threatening to make another <i>Indiana Jones</i> movie, even if it no longer looks like Steven Spielberg will direct it.</p><p>While these are all exciting projects—and notwithstanding the current crisis in the multiplexes—it can’t help but feel like we may never again get a movie quite like <i>The Mummy</i>, with its unlikely combination of eye-popping CGI, old-fashioned adventure tropes and a once-in-a-lifetime ensemble of overflowing hotness. Long may love for it reign on Letterboxd—let’s see if we can’t get that average rating up, the old fashioned way. For Anwen.</p>"

In what ways are the emotions of the premise personal to you?<br/></b>When I was making <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6jRO\"><i>Southcliffe</i></a> in 2012, I was back in England where I spent my childhood and I hadn’t been back in close to twenty years. It really struck me how London and New York felt very similar now but they didn’t when I was a kid. I thought maybe I wanted to make a film about a family that moves in that time and how a move can affect a family. As I wrote the script, I became a parent, so it became as much a reflection of modern adulthood as it did about my childhood in the ’80s. Although it’s a period piece, I wanted to make it feel very close to today to look at the celebrated values of the time and how those are still very relevant.</p><p><b>The mansion the family moves into is the titular ‘nest’, and the use of space and atmosphere contribute so much to the film’s subtext. What were you looking for when location scouting for the house? Was it an easy or difficult process?<br/></b>Yeah, it was difficult. It was like doing an open casting call. I had a very specific idea in my head but [my production designer] was able to put it into actual architectural terms so we were able to find a house that a successful commodities broker would live and commute from in Surrey. We needed something beyond that, but if you go too far, you get small castles. Once we located the right exterior, there were a bunch of [houses] that would’ve been great, but when we got inside, there were no open spaces. I wanted to have long hallways to be able to see through multiple rooms to create that isolation—the opposite of the cozy American house that they were living in before, to really highlight the good life they left behind.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>We love the soundtrack; not just the choice of songs but the way that they’re mixed. Can you give us some insight into the song selection?<br/></b>When writing, I build a playlist that I write to. This one was a mix of personal memories from childhood—like Simply Red, which takes me back to falling asleep in the back of my dad’s car—so there’s a way into writing there on a sensory level, and then I build upon it with songs that I love from the time. I was listening to Richard Reed Parry’s <i>Music for Heart and Breath</i> album a lot and he ended up being the composer of the film, so his music was always part of the heart of the movie as I was writing it.</p><p>I would spend my drives to set with my assistant talking about music and he would turn me onto some stuff that would make it into the movie. It was a mix of a long-running preparation and things that I pick up in the moment then making that all work at the right level so it feels of the world. Like with The Cure, we actually played that off a tape cassette when Allison walks into the room.</p><p><b>Since your debut feature in 2011, you’ve had a prolific career in television and as a film producer; you’re a founding member of Borderline Films with fellow directors Antonio Campos and Josh Mond. Do you see yourself more as a producer who only occasionally directs films yourself?<br/></b>No, I don’t really consider myself a producer. I’ve produced movies for filmmakers and friends and I help people where I can. I’m not someone who’s out getting properties and thinking about how to put together a film, I’m only thinking about my own work as a writer and a director. Between finishing <i>Southcliffe</i> in 2013 and <i>The Nest</i> in 2018, I had a five-year gap where I was developing lots of projects one after the other—two features and a television show—that were both so close to [being greenlit] but something fell through, which was really bad luck.</p><p><b>What film made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YVC\"><i>The Goonies</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b8e\"><i>Back to the Future</i></a> were those movies as a kid that first made me want to make movies and tell stories, but the moment where I realized what filmmaking is was seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Nu\"><i>The Shining</i></a>. I saw it for the first time when I was eleven or twelve and a friend showed it to me because his older brother had the VHS. It was my first time understanding atmosphere and direction and I just had a sense that I could do it too. It was a really crucial moment, and I kept that thought to myself for a very long time.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>What’s your scariest film that is not technically horror? AKA, your area of expertise.<br/></b>Oh man, scariest? Something I’ve watched recently is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ZTW\"><i>The Vanishing</i></a> and it’s probably one of the most unsettling films I’ve ever seen. It was incredible to rewatch it because I’d last seen it when I was in college—I watched everything back then—and I’d also seen the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28pm\">American remake</a>, so when I watched it this time, I was trying to remember things [that were different] from the remake. I was like “he’s gonna get out, right?—oh no, that’s in the American version!” I find it an astonishing movie. There’s a real human element to the pain of the killer.</p><p><b>Let’s nerd out: what’s your top film of 1986, the year that <i>The Nest</i> is set?<br/></b>[Laughs] I’ve no idea what came out in 1986. Can I look up a list and I’ll tell you? Let’s see, films of 1986… This is fun! Alright, “popular films of 1986” I’m seeing: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29BI\"><i>Blue Velvet</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/26zY\"><i>Short Circuit</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aOe\"><i>Stand by Me</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29BS\"><i>Platoon</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1SSM\"><i>The Color of Money</i></a>, what else have we got here? <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1C7q\"><i>River’s Edge</i></a>… <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TEw\">Pretty in Pink</a>…</i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YPY\"><i>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</i></a>—Ferris Bueller’s gotta be up there. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/21em\"><i>Big Trouble in Little China</i></a>! That’s it! I’m sure there’s other things, but from my quick search, I’d say <i>Big Trouble in Little China</i>. That was a movie that was always on in my house because it was one of my dad’s all-time favorites.</p><p><b>Which is Jude Law’s best performance?<br/></b>I love <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2924\"><i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i></a> so much. I constantly rewatch that movie—it’s perfect. I also loved him in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fcFk\"><i>Vox Lux</i></a> recently.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>What is the best film about marriage and why does it resonate with you?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/yaS\"><i>Shoot the Moon</i></a> was really influential for me. I’d say it’s a bit more about divorce and family than it is about marriage but [it depends on] if you take the ending to mean that they’re going to stay together—I kind of do. You could say a separation is part of a marriage. I love that movie for how it finds light in humor. Albert Finney is struggling with his masculinity where, even though he’s the one who left, he still thinks he owns it all, and Diane Keaton is quite liberated by this scenario. It’s like their journey to find language again. I find it very beautiful.</p><p><b>Which film was your entry-point into international cinema?<br/></b>I’m trying to think back to what I would’ve seen, there certainly wasn’t a lot growing up. In college I really discovered <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/michael-haneke/\">Michael Haneke</a> and Michelangelo Antonioni. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/23hs\"><i>L’Avventura</i></a> made a huge impact on me. I think [because of the way] the mystery kind of dissolves and it’s about the journey, not the solution.</p><p><b>What film do you wish you’d made?<br/></b>I don’t. Filmmaking is personal and it’s so much an expression of perspective when done with care and love—though obviously, there’s stuff that’s just churned out. I never see something and say “I wish I made that”. One of the things I find hard is when people critique films and say they would’ve done this differently. I’ve become very sensitive to that over time because every choice you make as a filmmaker is so specific and thought out. I try to consume movies without knowing anything about them or making any kind of judgment. I just let them be what they are and wash over me.</p><p><b>Which newcomer director should we all keep our eyes on?<br/></b>I don’t think I’m looking out for new stuff necessarily. Once I get to see something, everyone else already knows about it. One person I would say is Dave Franco, who I just worked with on <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lCQ6\"><i>The Rental</i></a>. I was an executive producer and I was a creative bounce-board for Dave through the process. It’s his first film and it’s astonishingly directed. We were getting dailies from the first week and we were like, “This is his first movie? This is insane!” I think he will do some exciting things.</p><p><b>Finally, what’s your favorite film of 2020 so far?<br/></b>I was absolutely blown away by Eliza Hittman’s film <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lWJk\"><i>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</i></a>. I miss having retrospectives at local theaters, which I’m always keyed into no matter the city I’m living in. I’ve started watching a lot of Criterion Channel and I watched a movie recently that’s taken over my brain: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/305A\"><i>Variety</i></a>, by Bette Gordon, from 1983. It’s set in New York City around Times Square, and it’s this incredible journey that this woman goes on that captured my mind.</p>"

Night Shyamalan was a pivotal moment in his career; seeing someone in the media who looked like him (as the son of Indian parents) gave him the confidence to pursue filmmaking. Personally aware of the life-changing consequences of representation in cinema, and having already cast an Asian-American lead in <i>Searching</i>, Chaganty and team created the leading role in <i>Run</i> specifically for an actress in a wheelchair.</p><p>“It’s something we want to do moving forward. We can objectively ‘give a win’ that is outside of the film, so the movie becomes impervious to being one hundred percent shit-on. People can at least be like, ‘Hey, they did that!’,” Chaganty jokes. “Obviously that’s just the funny way of saying it, but I think it’s important for us to use these opportunities to slip a card in the deck.”</p><p>The challenge, with a co-lead as iconic as Sarah Paulson, was in casting a young actress who could not only carry the film, but also go toe-to-toe with an industry legend. “It was really, really hard to find her,” says Chaganty of impressive newcomer Allen. Given the paucity of roles for performers with disabilities, “we knew that the person we were looking for most likely doesn’t have an agent or manager, may not have ever acted before, or know they can act. Our casting director, Rich Delia, did a massive hunt for an actress at school programs, after-school programs, art programs, disability programs, on Facebook, everywhere.</p><p>“Finally, we saw Kiera and her performance was so natural. We flew her to LA, she met Sarah, and then boom, we watched a star get born.”</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Chaganty was conscious of the fact that “[he’s] not disabled, [but] telling this story of somebody who is”. Once Allen was on board, he consulted with her constantly. “I gave her the script and the production design layout of the house and asked her to please note it up—tell us what is wrong, what you wouldn’t do. So much changed because she told us that this is not how she lives. Her costume, her room, bits of her motion, her dialogue and her backstory changed. We were very open to that. I’d ask her about the title—is the title <i>Run</i> offensive? We’re doing a double-play on it, but is it mean? I made sure that was okay with her.”</p><p>Chaganty and Allen also discussed and adjusted the film’s ending—no spoilers here—so as to avoid any insinuations of ableism. “I spent a lot of time talking to Disability Studies professors and Kiera about her arc as a character. This idea of ableism is something I’ve really learned about in the past two years.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i>Run</i>’s limited setting—much of the action takes place in the Sherman family’s rural two-level dwelling—accidentally captures the zeitgeist of being stuck at home. Coming directly off the back of <i>Searching</i>, the domestic mise-en-scène in <i>Run</i> feels like a signature Chaganty touch—not to mention a sure-fire way for an emerging filmmaker to get another movie under his belt.</p><p>Chaganty confirms this was the strategy: “I don’t want to be the filmmaker that I grew up watching who makes a sub-one-million-dollar movie that goes to Sundance then goes on to making a one-hundred-million-dollar movie and loses control, or loses sight of what it is to make a movie. I have every intention of making those big traditional movies that we grew up on one day, but I want to take it step by step.”</p><p>Limiting the story’s physical landscape means focusing on where the opportunities lie in the script, rather than in the budget—a writing exercise Chaganty says he and Ohanian are particularly drawn to. “Our subversion here was to take average domestic challenges and put our specific lead wheelchair-using character in them to turn those into <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/mission-impossible-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a> stakes. Anybody watching this movie would be able to slam open the door but [for Chloe] a simple door knob becomes a massive challenge. How do you turn a standard house into a prison, and why have we never seen it exactly like this before? I think that was a cool challenge for us.”</p><p><i>Searching</i> was notable for its seamless use of tech, much of which involved Cho acting against a blank screen, which was then brought to life in post-production. Though tech is just as pivotal in <i>Run</i>, there is deliberately a lot less of it. “<i>Run</i> could be made in the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s or 2000s,” says Chaganty, “I was intentionally trying to evoke the same feeling that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28gY\"><i>Misery</i></a> or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a6Q\"><i>Rear Window</i></a> had of ‘where are we, when are we?’—and that was very much a response to <i>Searching</i>.</p><p>“I didn’t want to be the tech filmmaker who could only make movies on computer screens. I needed to prove to myself that I knew how to make a movie. I wanted to make a movie that replaced technical complexity with simplicity, gimmick for a classical structure, and conversations about larger big tech with a straightforward, bare-bones thriller.”</p><!--figure[4]--><p>For a timeless thriller, <i>Run</i> is oddly timely; we noticed an almost irrelevant detail: a bottle of medicine that Chloe is holding reads ‘4 Refills Before 02/21/20’. This date was just three weeks before lockdown in the US. “It’s funny because we put that date on the bottle thinking that’s so far ahead in time!” Chaganty is thinking a lot about how the coronavirus pandemic will affect storytelling, as he and Ohanian embark on their next screenplay.</p><p>“I think every single screenwriter right now is thinking about this too: is the story taking place in the pandemic or post-pandemic? Everyday I’m obsessed with the next <a href=\"https://boxd.it/l7zS\"><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a>, so my Google and Twitter feed is always about what they’re shooting, and they’re not wearing masks when they’re rolling. I would one hundred percent put money down that they reference the pandemic but [that] it’s something in the past and it’s not happening anymore.</p><p>“Michael Bay’s new movie <a href=\"https://boxd.it/r2xY\"><i>Songbird</i></a> has Covid-23 spreading rampant, and HBO Max is making a show called <a href=\"https://boxd.it/sG9O\"><i>Station Eleven</i></a> based on a pandemic story [adapted from Emily St. John Mandel’s 2014 novel]. There’s going to be a limit to how much I can watch of these and I don’t want to feel that way all the time. I think we’re going to start looking at stories past the pandemic that just reference it and life goes on.</p><p>“That’s what our next film is going to do, because now that there’s a little bit of hope and optimism seeping into the general mainstream, as far as when a vaccine is going to come out and administration changes, we can start to look a year ahead and be like ‘okay, next Christmas might actually be normal’. We can start imagining the future.”</p><p>Back in the present, Chaganty admits to being somewhat glued to Letterboxd as his new film makes its way into the world. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aneeshchaganty/\">A member since 2018</a>, he confirms that, yes, he will be reading reviews of <i>Run</i>. “Dude, I love Letterboxd. I’m going to be really honest, I don’t want to be a filmmaker who can’t look at the public opinion about their own work. If I’m to get better, I have to some degree be like ‘this didn’t work at all’ or ‘this is great!’.</p><p>“It makes the movie more attractive too in a way, since it’s not like we’re saying ‘here’s a perfect movie!’ It’s ‘here’s something we really tried out and I’m going to do better next time’. I know what I did really well and I know what I didn’t do well at all. It’s a balance. I just want to be a filmmaker who can talk about their work, and I plan on writing a <i>Run</i> review on Letterboxd sometime. I think I can get better that way.”</p>"

In fact, only <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a5e\">Jaws</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/7DPK\">Carol</a></i> remain from the last top ten. The Letterboxd community favors a wider world view: in 2017, the top 100 had only one film by a female director; in 2020 there are eight. The list has gone from exactly zero films entirely in languages other than English, to two (<i>Portrait</i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/hTha\">Parasite</a></i>), with several more containing a portion of non-English dialogue. Not quite leaping the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, but it’s progress. And, there is substantially more LGBTQ+ representation all round.</p><p>This year’s top 100 shows that we still like to return to the idea of the auteur, and the challenge of a franchise. In 2017, Christopher Nolan was the filmmaker with the highest number of highly rated, obsessively rewatched films; in 2020 Quentin Tarantino has taken the lead, just ahead of Nolan. Joining them in the multiple-titles group are Edgar Wright, Peter Jackson, Joe and Anthony Russo, epic-scale filmmakers from whom we’ve learned so much, and whose films have more to offer the viewer on every watch. (When ratings are not part of the equation, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/9vE4\">Avengers: Endgame</a>—</i>still with a respectable 3.9 average—was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/2019/#most-obsessively-rewatched\">the Most Obsessively Rewatched title of 2019</a>. “You give me someone flying, turning invisible, super speed… that’s where I live,” explains obsessive rewatcher Max Joseph <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/190750950948/most-picture-2020\">this Letterboxd interview</a>. “In <i>Endgame</i>, I get a little bit of every genre and mood.”)</p><h2>Obsessed with obsession</h2><p>What is “obsessive”? To put some kind of parameters around the search for this year’s top 100, our team looked for the feature films that had five or more rated watches from a minimum of 150 Letterboxd members each, then we sorted that list by the ratings of those members.</p><p>But that word—“obsessive”—got me thinking. Just <i>how obsessive</i> are we talking here? It’s reassuring to know that <i>Parasite</i> is, naturally, a film we enjoy returning to, but when we’re talking about rewatches <i>plural</i>, what happens when we sort these 100 highly rated titles by another value: the number of diary entries logged by these obsessive members. And what would that list say about our tendencies as watchers?</p><p>Spoiler: we also pulled those numbers, and found an entirely different top ten:</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Look at that image. Compare it with the inarguable cinephilia of the ratings-based top ten, which soars on critical strength. What are we seeing here? That’s not the question. The real question is: what are we <i>feeling</i>? What do these ten films do to us so consistently, that helps them to retain high ratings across many, many, <i>many</i> rewatches?</p><p>You see, in the top 100, members typically log their favorites between five and seven times—but there’s a select handful of titles that see an average of up to 24 viewings per obsessive member. You read that right. There is a film on Letterboxd that multiple obsessive members have watched 24 times or more, at the time of writing.</p><!--figure[3]--><h2>Comedy that never gets old</h2><p>The film in question is Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7eQy\"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a>, a genre-smart mockumentary about three vampire housemates just, well, pure vibing. It’s entirely in a league of its own, no doubt helped by a spin-off series, with the next entry, The Lonely Island’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/blDa\"><i>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</i></a> racking up an average of 17.7 rewatches per obsessive member.</p><p>These top two most obsessively rewatched titles make sense. When you’re feeling low, or when there’s some time to kill, what better place to turn than somewhere where the jokes never get old? As <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1svnd5\">James writes</a> on Letterboxd, <i>Shadows</i> “never fails to make me laugh”. <i>Never fails</i>. Taking a chance on a new comedy harbors its risks, so when you find the ones that work, you have to hold onto them like gold dust. It’s the sense of familiarity that comes from the same sharp, self-aware sketches, the endlessly quotable one-liners and screenshots that make memes feel like works of art.</p><p>(On that note, I asked the team: what were the highest-rated, obsessively rewatched comedy specials? No surprises: Bo Burnham’s masterful 2016 Netflix special <a href=\"https://boxd.it/e436\"><i>Make Happy</i></a>, and John Mulaney’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iTts\"><i>Kid Gorgeous at Radio City</i></a>. Comedy is good when it catches you off guard—but in a pandemic, it’s even better when you can rely on it to deliver that same rush of endorphins, every time.)</p><!--figure[4]--><h2>Thank you for the music</h2><p>Speaking of pick-me-ups, ever notice how much better you feel after karaoke? Or, when you know everyone else has gone out so you can let rip across every inch of the house with ultimate privacy? The cathartic thrill that comes from a sing-along is what keeps our obsessive members returning to musicals, increasingly. There’s comfort in memorized lyrics; the words we yell and hold dear.</p><p>You’ve got this in <i>Popstar</i> (‘Finest Girl’, anyone?) and, crucially, in a double-bill of jukebox musicals celebrating ABBA’s greatest hits: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Tnq\"><i>Mamma Mia!</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gnfO\"><i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again</i></a>. With fifteen rewatches on average for the former, and almost seventeen for the latter, the sequel’s slight upper hand proves the film’s triumphant formula—there really is an endless supply of ABBA bangers—but also that the repurposing of the most pivotal tracks (‘Mamma Mia’ and ‘Waterloo’) will work even better the second time around, due to the familiarity, both of the songs and now their new-found purpose in this world.</p><p>The feeling of singing along with Lily James as Donna, as she dances around Paris with her young Harry, of latching onto Cher’s every breath as she reunites with the eponymous Fernando—these moments become part of our own memory, and the satisfaction that comes from performing them again and again never fades. It’s also why so many musicals are rewatchable staples. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29oY\"><i>Singin’ in the Rain</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iehK\"><i>Rocketman</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/f1TK\"><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3OsE\"><i>Pitch Perfect</i></a> all feature in the top 100.</p><p>Out of interest, I asked the team to lift the curtain on non-narrative music films to see which greats we return to. Again, zero surprise (to me, at least): Jonathan Demme’s transcendent Talking Heads concert film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ygo\">Stop Making Sense</a></i> is, and has long been, the highest-rated, most obsessively rewatched concert documentary on Letterboxd. And it’s only been a few months, but the Disney+ filmed version of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kmvE\"><i>Hamilton</i></a> is up there, along with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lS2Q\">Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé</a></i>. #BEYHIVE, come in.</p><!--figure[5]--><h2>Maybe we should trust love</h2><p>At the other end of the spectrum, two titles in the most obsessively rewatched top ten point to our tendencies to find catharsis in our most extreme, most vulnerable expressions of emotion. Our two revealing films here are <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/g02s\">Love, Simon</a></i> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4VZ8\"><i>Interstellar</i></a>—one a grounded and sensitive coming-of-age picture of a teenage boy’s coming out, the other an epic space-travel thriller. Still, both films understand that, ultimately, love transcends all.</p><p>These films make room for us to revisit these most searing feelings, of love hidden, lost, afraid or universal, they let us cry out what we relate to, and escape into whichever onscreen emotions we prefer to project ourselves into beyond our own lives, time and time again. Because however much changes, you know you’ll always crave and be rewarded by love. (And by the existential exploration that often accompanies these big feelings: Don Hertzfeldt&rsquo;s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/world-of-tomorrow-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">World of Tomorrow</a></i> is the highest-rated, most obsessively rewatched short film with Letterboxd members.)</p><!--figure[6]--><h2>Ink spots and needle drops</h2><p>The idea of projection—of escape beyond our own lives—comes back often when thinking of the rewatch. But certain titles reveal how we choose to find escape in a quite literal form; observe the love for <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/15gO\">Tangled</a></i>, rewatched on average ten times per obsessive member.</p><p>And then there’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29z8\">Shrek 2</a></i>, revisited on average 7.9 times (more on this bizarre, outstanding oddity on its own soon). The leap of faith into an animated world is one that offers a blank canvas painted over with new colors: the pastel pinks and soft peach oranges of sunset skies in <i>Tangled</i>, the rich purples and blues of the twinkling lights of the afterlife in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/bYJQ\">Coco</a></i>, the playful blue waters of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/8tfY\">Moana</a></i>, with the sun giving everything a new glow. Animation works as relaxation here, clearing the mind and coloring it calmly time and time again. Elsa said it first: you can, and should, let it all go.</p><p>It is entirely probable, of course, that no Letterboxd parent is logging the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/frozen-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Frozens</i></a>—or any other animated family film, for that matter—as often as their household is actually watching them, the truth of which would completely upend this data. We know the math underpinning this whole exercise is somewhat arbitrary, but it’s an interesting starting point from which to analyze why certain things just work, again and again.</p><!--figure[7]--><p>Take the oddity that is <i>Shrek 2</i>, deserving of its own dissection purely because of how masterfully it combines so many of the previously established elements. This film and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29zi\">its predecessor</a> create so many vivid images that fit into the category of animated escapism, but music plays a major part, also. ‘Accidentally In Love’ by Counting Crows as Shrek and Fiona blissfully enjoy their honeymoon period; ‘Funky Town’ by Lipps Inc. as Shrek, Fiona and Donkey roll into Far Far Away; Jennifer Saunders as Fairy Godmother, with her sublime cover of Bonnie Tyler’s ‘Holding Out For A Hero’. There are too many perfect needle-drop moments to count, and every time the rewatch comes around, they feel new.</p><p>Add to the comforting visuals and euphoric music the countless one-liners, perfectly performed by Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers, but really, here, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming—a squirm-inducing, note-perfect pantomimic performance. <i>Shrek 2</i> might just be the defining example of what makes a good movie the <i>best</i> movie, and one that only grows greater with every rewatch. Lucky us.</p><!--figure[8]--><h2>Festive fever</h2><p>The inclusion of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29sw\">A Christmas Story</a></i>, the second-last in our most rewatched top ten, makes sense when considering the times in our lives when we turn to movies for comfort (and discomfort: note the Hallowe’en-related rewatchables in the top 100). <i>A Christmas Story</i> might not be your first festive choice, but you will have your own equivalent. <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1WgC\">The Muppet Christmas Carol</a></i> also made the top 100, with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1VyK\">Elf</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aeU\">Love, Actually</a></i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/home-alone-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">the <i>Home Alone</i> movies</a> bubbling under. We recognize all the beats, and seeing as the holidays return each year, it’s natural that we return to the titles that make us feel most at home within them.</p><p>Like <i>Carol</i>. Darling <i>Carol</i>. The last of our top ten most most most rewatched. Flung out of space into our eyeballs by Todd Haynes as some sort of Christmas miracle, its rewatchability as much seasonal as it is about love, representation, vintage glamor and that final scene. Let’s see where <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/iS3I\">Happiest Season</a></i> sits this time next year, shall we?</p><p>And so, what can filmmakers and distributors learn from what we want to see, not just once, but again and again? In just four years the list of titles the Letterboxd community has chosen to revisit and protect has blossomed with an open heart and feverishly enthusiastic mind.</p><!--figure[9]--><p>Looking over the top 100 highest-rated, obsessively rewatched films in 2020, we want more queer love: <i>Portrait</i>, <i>Moonlight</i> and <i>Carol</i> but also <i>Booksmart</i>, <i>The Favourite</i>, <i>Call Me by Your Name</i>. We definitely need more singing and dancing: <i>Suspiria</i>, <i>La La Land</i>, <i>Singin’ in the Rain</i>, <i>Mamma Mia</i> and beyond.</p><p>We want more adventure, more time travel, more mind-melters, more drinking, exploring, investigating, more talking animals, more drugs, more laughs, more tears, more goosebumps. We want more full-body feelings of falling in love with a movie you know you’ll hold onto with everything you’ve got.</p><p>In the end, numbers can only tell us so much, and these numbers are drawn from what we’ve already seen, which is what’s already managed to make it through the system. There’s as much to learn from <i>how</i> these films were made as there is from what they’re <i>about</i>. Because, no matter how many AI tools people dream up to help with the green-lighting process, moviemaking is fundamentally about magic. And when all the right ingredients make it into the cauldron, the spell can be so strong that a film will win our hearts forever.</p>"

The hunt for projects she could take the lead on began after the jolt of missing out on a role uniquely suited to her: Tonya Harding in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dzR0\"><i>I, Tonya</i></a>. “I grew up as a figure skater, I competed nationally in Canada for ten years,” Åkerman says, recalling that she hit up her team: “I just said, ‘How come I didn’t even get called in for this?’ And they said, ‘Well, because Margot Robbie built it from the ground up. She produced it.’ I went ‘aaah’ and a light bulb went up over me and I went, ‘Alright, that’s it, I just have to take things into my own hands and start finding material’.”</p><p><i>Chick Fight</i> was scripted by first-time feature writer Joseph Downey, who strives to create female-led stories. Some aspects feel contrived—a rivalry between Anna and Bella Thorne’s Olivia in particular; Alec Baldwin in general—but Åkerman worked with director Paul Leyden, a good friend, to enhance “the female perspective and the female voice” in the script. This comes across in scenes between Anna and Charleen, which tingle with no-bullshit connection. “I think that the important message in this film was sisterhood. It’s so important to focus on the fact that women supporting women has so much power and strength. We need to stick together and we need to be this force of unity.”</p><p>In the pursuit of more projects, her lockdown has been a whirl of Zoom meetings with potential writers—a silver lining of the pandemic. “I’ve had time to focus on searching for new material. Just taking the bull by the horns and creating the material that [I] wanna create. That is the way to go.” Åkerman herself is partial to “films that breathe”, giving <a href=\"https://boxd.it/21ew\"><i>No Country for Old Men</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/292o\"><i>Babel</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dYmm\"><i>Call Me by Your Name</i></a> as examples. “I just think there is so much art involved in those types of films.” Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton stand out in her “Rolodex of actors” as particular fascinations. “Anything Tilda does, I will watch.”</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Those films and artists, Åkerman readily adds, are “a long shot from the kinds of genres I usually get myself involved in”. <i>Chick Fight</i>, on the other hand, fits neatly in the Åkerman universe—a breezy comedy that balances silly training montages with meatier questions. While above ground, it looks like a classic comedy, the underground cage fights are filmed at high-speed to allow for the visceral, glossy slow-mo shots that come part-and-parcel with today’s movie fights—roundhouse kicks, fists meeting bones, spit and blood flying—and sound effects to match. “That guttural, animal instinct is so amazing to be able to release,” Åkerman enthuses.</p><p>It feels important to note, given the David Fincher elephant in the room, that <i>Chick Fight</i>’s only commonality with <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a9q\"><i>Fight Club</i></a> is the three words “secret fight club”. Åkerman says the films that more directly influenced <i>Chick Fight</i> are <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Uk\"><i>Rocky</i></a> (“this is the comedic version of that underdog story”), and the buddy-movie vibe of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Ew\"><i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i></a>. “That’s the closest to this that we could get. It’s that ‘enough is enough’ feeling. I just love that film. It’s, like, ‘Fuck the system and fuck society as it’s been created and told us to be and not to be. Let’s break down those barriers’.”</p><p>The <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i> connection feels especially strong in Anna’s very sudden economic descent from small business owner to evicted, unemployed and dispossessed. It’s a clear-eyed statement, in the middle of a comedy, on the lack of a social safety net in America, particularly for women—and on the importance of finding your own community (and for many, choosing your own family).</p><p>Åkerman was born in Sweden and raised in Canada; both are countries with stronger systems in place for social support, and pro-women policies. “Everything seems a bit more logical over there.” On pandemic-ridden, post-election America, she says, “That&rsquo;s been really interesting, to take into account what kind of country we’re actually living in and what needs to be worked on. I hope that we continue to move forward and not backwards as far as women and equality goes.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p>Among the many downsides of the coronavirus pandemic, one is the closure of gyms and sports clubs, an inconvenient side-effect at a time when exercise—an outlet for stress and frustration—is so beneficial for mental-health management. Which brings us back to the joy of boxing: “Most of us have so much on our minds; life is so full of anxiety, or stresses, and it’s so hard to shut that off.”</p><p>“Some people are able to shut up their brains by actually sitting and meditating. My brain just gets much louder when I do that, so if I am able to just concentrate on not getting hit in the face, I am completely out of my mind and in my body.”</p>"

The ‘Small Axe’ anthology will be released on a weekly rollout on Amazon Prime Video beginning November 20 with ‘<a href=\"https://boxd.it/qEAa\">Mangrove</a>’, then ‘Lovers Rock’, ‘<a href=\"https://boxd.it/siQE\">Red, White and Blue</a>’, ‘<a href=\"https://boxd.it/sff6\">Alex Wheatle</a>’ and finally ‘<a href=\"https://boxd.it/shic\">Education</a>’. Seen at: NYFF, BFI London Film Festival.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/qEAk\"><i>Lovers Rock</i></a>, the first part of Steve McQueen’s ambitious, multi-part film project <i>Small Axe</i>, feels like a massive stylistic departure for the filmmaker, in a manner that completely transfixes and astounds. It’s no wonder that this one turned heads at multiple festivals, as it’s immediately warmer, more freewheeling and sensual than any other McQueen work. It’s defined by a hypnotic focus on sound and touch, represented in its earliest scenes with a tactile close-up of a heated comb working its way through hair, and later with its focus on hands wrapped around shoulders, moving across shirts and dresses, people joining together and/or colliding through song and dance. Despite being made for television, it’s astounding how little <i>Lover’s Rock</i> feels that way. Often impressionistic and unbound to the kind of urgency or efficiency that naturally comes with having to adhere to a time-slot, it simply rests in the moment. With the seismic protests being undertaken by Black people this year, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/qEAk\"><i>Lovers Rock</i></a> feels like more than welcome respite from a hateful populace—visually rich, gorgeously soundtracked Black joy and love. Also, man, those shirts are incredible. —KC</p><!--figure[2]--><p><i><b>Nomadland</b><br/>Written and directed by Chloé Zhao. In US theaters December 4. Seen at: TIFF, NYFF, BFI London Film Festival.</i></p><p>“I am already convinced that Chloé Zhao deserves the whole world,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lPuHD\">writes Jaime</a> of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnRy\">Nomadland</a></i>, the TIFF People’s Choice winner. Personal security is something we don’t think about on a daily basis. We have shelter, we can buy food, anything else is bonus. But what if those two basic tenets vanish? While the global financial crisis affected all in 2008, it affected retirees more. Supposedly secure retirement investments vanished; security no more. What do you do? Survive. Zhao’s adaptation of Jessica Bruder’s 2017 non-fiction masterpiece <i>Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century</i> is a beacon of human spirit and survival. It may not be pretty, but it’s real. It’s not something to be embarrassed about, it’s something to be proud of. Those that let this happen to good, honest working people should be the ones embarrassed. —JW</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i><b>Minari</b><br/>Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. No release date announced. Seen at: Middleburg Film Festival.</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/mL9M\">Minari</a></i> is the medicine for these tough times. It’s a wonderful, wonderful, deeply personal, utterly serene and metaphysical portrait of America—freedom, faith, superstition, forces of nature, and ambition collide with the costs of intoxicating capitalist dreams, but not without a whole lot of heart. This is elegantly crafted, at once organic in its approach and always sweepingly cinematic. The film’s gentle sense of humor ensures that it never takes itself too seriously and allows the weight of its poetic images and juxtapositions to guide the narrative. The brilliant ensemble should grow to join Steven Yeun as household names (well, cinephile households). Youn Yuh-jung and Alan Kim are bright sparks as the latest classic duo of sassy grandma and precocious grandchild, but it’s Han Ye-ri—taking on the surrogate role of director Lee Isaac Chung’s mother—who provides an overlooked and tender sounding board for familial bonds in fraction. <i>Minari</i> is truly one of 2020’s most invaluable and essential pieces of art, living up to the hype built since Sundance. Korea came to the USA for the Oscars earlier this year, and if 2021 shows similar mercy, there’s a chance you’ll see this home-grown Asian-American picture mounting that stage in future. —JM </p><!--figure[4]--><p><i><b>Wolfwalkers</b><br/>Directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, written by Will Collins with Moore and Stewart. Recently released in UK theaters; coming to Apple TV+ December 11. Seen at: TIFF, BFI London Film Festival.</i></p><p>The <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/628741330780209152/drawing-closer\">much-anticipated</a> Cartoon Saloon adventure <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/fGrC\">Wolfwalkers</a></i> was met with only joy around here. A fable about what happens when a colonizing force tries to tame a wild forest, set during Oliver Cromwell’s Siege of Kilkenny, <i>Wolfwalkers </i>builds to “one of the most sensational animated third acts I’ve seen in years,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mPJ3d\">according to Animatedantic</a>. The film’s themes are embedded in every hand-drawn line and stroke. “It’s not sleek and seamless and modern,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mlxrn\">writes Cow Shea</a>. “This is transparently a true work of art where all the work of that art is part of the finished product.” Mebh and Robyn are animated action heroes for the ages, and you’ll hear a lot about ‘Wolfvision’ in the weeks to come—for very good reason. Werewolf films have, for years, tried different ways to put us inside the beast’s mind, but Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart followed their noses and it’s as thrilling as things get. —GG</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i><b>David Byrne’s American Utopia</b><br/>Directed by Spike Lee. On HBO and HBO Max now. Seen at: TIFF, NYFF, BFI London Film Festival.</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oUAG\">David Byrne’s American Utopia</a></i> is well on track to join Jonathan Demme’s film of another Byrne stage outing, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ygo\">Stop Making Sense</a></i> (1984), as one of the highest-rated <i>anythings</i> on Letterboxd. We’re still deciding whether this film <i></i>is sublime because the stage show itself is sublime, or because Spike Lee has sublimely captured the whole joyous thing for us to inject into our eyeballs, time and again, for far less than the price of a Broadway ticket. Let’s be honest: it’s due to both, and more besides. It’s a blessing upon 2020, of that we are certain. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mSk3X\">As Clint writes</a>, “The phrase ‘this is the film we need right now’ is such a creaky cliché, but there’s an ineffable feeling that, if David Byrne and Spike Lee can’t heal the world with grey suits, bare feet, and some of the most all-encompassing works of music ever written, no one can.” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lClI7\">As my colleague says</a>, “will rewatch to death”. —GG</p><!--figure[6]--><p><i><b>Shiva Baby</b><br/>Written and directed by Emma Seligman. On the festival circuit. Seen at: TIFF, LFF.</i></p><p>A girl walks into a shiva and bumps into her sugar daddy. What sounds like a joke sets up 77 minutes of note-perfect comedy horror in Emma Seligman’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oIv0\">Shiva Baby</a></i>, her feature debut adapted from her dissertation short of the same name. It’s funny, horrifying, excruciating and so painfully, accurately Jewish. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lGKNT\">Isaac Feldberg calls it</a> “cruelly hilarious about everything smothering and inevitably miserable about Jewish family gatherings”, but Seligman’s sharp eye for comedy, her affection for her teen hero Danielle (Rachel Sennott, a bona fide star) just figuring her career out and owning her sexuality (Molly Gordon playing Danielle’s overachieving ex-girlfriend Maya is a highlight) cuts straight to the core, however you relate. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lCrDR\">Matt Neglia points out</a> how <i>Shiva Baby</i> “captures the behaviors of its characters with the same level of dry wit and detail as the Coen Brothers would”. What a thrill for a young, smart, Jewish, bisexual woman to be setting the pace now. Keep an eye on Seligman’s bright, bright future. —EK</p><!--figure[7]--><p><i><b>Tove</b><br/>Directed by Zaida Bergroth, written by Eeva Putro. Released in Finland; on the festival circuit elsewhere. Seen at: TIFF.</i></p><p>If there was a film swoony enough to fill the <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>-sized hole in your heart this year, it’s Zaida Bergroth’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/msKO\">Tove</a></i>, a bewitching biopic of Finnish author and illustrator Tove Jansson, creator of the beloved Moomin cartoon characters. Set in Helsinki during and post-World War II, the film orbits around her boho world, flitting between her creative struggles as a painter and deep sexual awakening with married theater director Vivica Bandler (Krista Kosonen). <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lOceB\">As Lillian says</a>, “Lesbians and Moomins is such a huge fucking mood I never wanted it to end.” Alma Pöysti shines effortlessly in the lead role. “The film happens on her fantastic face,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1muEuL\">writes Hannu</a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lvq9d\">Seth agrees</a>: “a captivating first-class drama about a world-renowned talent in search of her own identity, love and freedom.” A cozy fall-season perfection. —AY</p><!--figure[8]--><p><b><b><i>Shadow in the Cloud<br/></i></b></b><i>Co-written and directed by Roseanne Liang. Slated for a summer 2021 release. Seen at: TIFF, AFI Fest.</i></p><p>A proud addition to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/EKqg\">the “she did that!” canon</a>, the single downside of Roseanne Liang’s genre-perfect, “<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mI8nL\">deliciously fearless</a>” Midnight Madness winner <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/pah6\">Shadow in the Cloud</a> </i>is that there was no Midnight Madness to experience it at—but thanks to a juicy sale out of TIFF, we can look forward to a premiere next summer. Chloë Grace Moretz is Maude Garrett, a WWII pilot assigned to transport a highly classified package over the Pacific. The all-male crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress banishes her to the lower ball turret, where they harass, gaslight and leer over her—and that is nowhere near the worst part of this bonkers, non-stop hell flight, which Moretz carries like the future action hero she must now become, if the movie goddesses are listening. —GG</p><!--figure[9]--><p><i><b>Pieces of a Woman</b><br/>Directed by Kornél Mundruczó, written by Kata Wéber. Coming soon to Netflix. Seen at: TIFF, NYFF.</i></p><p>You will be hearing a <i>lot</i> about Vanessa Kirby in the months to come. <i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/nOrQ\">Pieces of a Woman</a></i> is an arresting, often taxing watch, but few actors have delivered a performance as utterly overwhelming as Kirby portraying Martha, a grieving mother processing the loss of her baby. The filmmaking team (Mundruczo and Weber share a “film by” credit) zoom in on deep, jagged pain, and tease out some of the most affecting moments put to screen this year. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mjB81\">Jack calls the film</a> “an intensely intimate depiction of mental and marital deterioration caused by tragedy” and nods to master Howard Shore’s “subtle yet potent” score. It’s poetry in motion, with stunning turns from Shia LaBeouf, Ellen Burstyn, Sarah Snook and Benny Safdie also. But proceed with caution: “this film will destroy you”, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mUK3t\">Alisha Tabilin warns</a>. —EK</p><!--figure[10]--><p><i><b>Underplayed</b><br/>Directed by Stacey Lee. On the festival circuit. Seen at: TIFF. (Also recommended in <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/632831921863491584/music-is-the-medicine-the-rock-doctor-is-in-our\">our music movies round-up</a>.)</i></p><p>Women-in-the-workplace movies aren’t usually this banging. Stacey Lee’s documentary <a href=\"https://boxd.it/rDfC\"><i>Underplayed</i></a> focuses on one corner of the still wildly sexist music industry—the dance-music scene—and lays out both the facts and feelings regarding why women still, always, deserve better. A number of key names guide the story—Rezz, Alison Wonderland, Nervo, TokiMonsta—giving the viewer a taste of what we’re missing out on while booking the same old men, over and over. And it’s not just because of the stats or the injustices that this is a must-watch: in times of limited social interaction and when the feeling of an adrenaline-fuelled crowd feels like a foggy memory, Lee captures some truly electric moments of these women thriving, captivating thousands of music lovers at once. “Buy yourself <i>good speakers</i> and turn them <i>up</i> because this movie is <i>fun</i> and it <i>deserves it</i>,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mjrJL\">writes Matt Brown</a>, and he’s absolutely correct. <i>Underplayed</i> is essential and exciting. The most entertaining education of the year. —EK</p><!--figure[11]--><p><i><b>Another Round</b><br/>Directed by Thomas Vinterburg, written by Vinterburg and Tobias Lindholm. Awaiting new UK date due to lockdown. In US cinemas soon. Seen at: TIFF, LFF.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lkba\"><i>Another Round</i></a> reunites filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg with his muse Mads Mikkelsen, in a lads-on-tour buddy movie, except the lads are four middle-aged high-school teachers, and the tour features a very casual, very constant level of intoxication each man commits to in the name of a social experiment. What could possibly go wrong, you ask? Plenty, naturally—but Vinterberg marries the slapstick moments of bumbling drunks falling over themselves with more mature, poignant scenes that question just how far you can or should go to feel that little bit more alive. There’s a lot to love here, but if we’re being very precise, it’s “rock-solid proof that Mads Mikkelsen is one of our greatest actors,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1mqhtH\">says Karen Han</a>. Come for the wise, contemplative study of youth and spontaneity, stay for rock-solid proof that Mads Mikkelsen is also, somehow, one of our greatest contemporary dancers. —EK</p><!--figure[12]--><p><i><b>One Night in Miami</b><br/>Directed by Regina King, adapted by Kemp Powers from his own stage play. In select US theaters December 25, coming to Amazon Prime Video January 15, 2021. Seen at: TIFF, NYFF.</i></p><p>Ladies and gentleman, Regina King has arrived. The actor wastes nothing in her feature directorial debut, bringing to the screen Kemp Powers’ vivid stage play of the same name with a heavyweight cast of greats. Kingsley Ben-Adir, Eli Goree, Aldis Hodge and Leslie Odom Jr. are Malcolm X, Cassius Clay (before he took the name Muhammad Ali), Jim Brown and Sam Cooke respectively, as the four men celebrate Clay’s victory over Sonny Liston in February 1964, during <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oCUo\"><i>One Night in Miami</i></a>. Rachel Wagner notes how “they all feel like friends and have chemistry, but each with a unique perspective”. This chemistry comes from King’s perfect alchemy of mood, design and structure; she lets her men speak, but her voice is never lost. “Queen King never wavers on her vision until every bit of flesh is torn off each man,” Ben notes, admiring a film that shines for all its famous faces, but stands the test of time for its rich, piercing empathy for every other one waiting in the shadows. —EK</p><!--figure[13]--><p><i><b>Supernova</b><br/>Written and directed by Harry Macqueen.

Seen at: BFI London Film Festival.</i></p><p>Colin Firth at his very best, Stanley Tucci losing his grip on himself, the luscious Lake District and endless cozy, delicious, warm knitwear. <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/nQ6K\">Supernova</a></i> is every bit as beautiful as it sounds, but also packs a major punch when it comes to mapping a lifelong love story, and the cost of loyalty and pride when you’re fighting against pain nobody can control. As Sam and Tusker, devoted to one another for decades, come to terms with Tusker’s diagnosis of early on-set dementia, there is as much care and sadness as is to be expected, but it still feels brand new and cuts deep. Every good love story is its own. Director Harry Macqueen and his two shining stars understand this better than anyone. —EK<br/></p><!--figure[14]--><p><i><b>French Exit<br/></b>Directed by Azazel Jacobs, written by Patrick DeWitt. Scheduled for US release January 21, 2021. Seen at NYFF.</i></p><p>Armed with acerbic wit and sharpened claws, Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a vulnerable close-to-career-best performance in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/m81Y\">French Exit</a></i> as a mother free-falling from wealth and reconciling with her son, an expertly cold Lucas Hedges. What appears to be formal and dry (“rich white-people stuff”, blegh) is actually wonderfully weird and surprisingly spiritual. There’s a divisive scene at the half-way point that instantly unroots the movie from any grounding we assumed it had established. In any other film, it would open up an entire world of possibilities, but <i>French Exit</i> decidedly treats it as matter-of-fact in order to focus on the emotional journey. It’s the decisive moment—you’re on its wavelength, or you’re overboard—and the rewards for staying aboard are plentiful. Patrick DeWitt’s adaptation of his own novel is in good hands with director Azazel Jacobs. —JM</p><!--figure[15]--><p><i><b>Still Processing</b><br/>Directed by Sophy Romvari</i>. <i>On the festival circuit.

I’ve always been more than a little obsessed with tracking what movies I own on physical media, so obsessively tracking the movies I’ve seen was a natural progression. As a kid growing up through the VHS home-video revolution, I collected movies; not just retail VHS movies, but recordings of movies off of television.</p><p>When laserdiscs hit the scene, I was an early adopter and even made VHS backups of all my laserdiscs. When I went to film school I brought literally hundreds of movies on VHS and laserdisc with me, and needed to keep track of it all. So you could say that I have some experience organizing and logging my cinema experience. The services that Letterboxd provides is a natural progression of my instincts to catalog the art form I love so much.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pro/\">I became a Patron</a> because something snapped in me one day—I realized how much I was relying on the service, and how generally pleasant the app is, and was embarrassed to realize that I had not already become a Patron. It was a slam-dunk decision for me to become a Patron. I want Letterboxd to be around for a long, long time. Forever, preferably.</p><p><b>Which feature do you find the most useful?<br/></b>The simple act of logging the movies I’ve seen is the killer feature from my perspective. Any bozo with a text editor can do this on their own, but Letterboxd makes this simple task easy and pleasant. And the ability to create lists, to rate the films, to review the films, creating a watchlist, adding reviews, and being a part of a kind and civil social network—that’s all gravy to me.</p><p>I’ve been using IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes since their inceptions, and they’ve both become big, bloated messes that try to be all things for all people, including advertisers and privacy trackers. They’re invaluable resources, but they’re not fun to use; using them is like being required to open up a poorly wired electrical panel to turn off a few lights in your house. There’s a lot of data on those websites but it’s not intuitively laid out, nor are a joy to use.</p><p>I don’t follow too many people on Letterboxd—my follow list is mostly people I know personally. I haven’t really dived into that end of the pool too deeply. But, quite literally, the simple act of tracking the movies I’ve seen has been invaluable for me. I think it was back at the end of 2014 when I said, “I’m going to try this out. I’m going to log every new movie I see starting in 2015.” After about a couple of years of doing it, I realized I was using my list to help recommend movies to people more often.</p><p>One of my biggest pet peeves in cinema fandom is a combination of two things—one, people childishly saying something like “they just don’t make good scary movies anymore” and two, my poor memory. I’d like to quickly respond with a list of scary movies made in the last decade off the top of my head, but I can’t. With my Letterboxd history, I can just quickly bring up my profile and rattle off titles like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hNVe\"><i>Hereditary</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/77xu\"><i>The Babadook</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/a75m\"><i>Green Room</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/76RS\"><i>The Guest</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/87wo\"><i>It Follows</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/eOCm\"><i>Get Out</i></a>, etc.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>We’d love to hear about the four faves on your profile. What impact do they have for you?<br/></b>First of all, I’m gonna assume that other movie fans have had the same experience as me when deciding what four films deserve to live in that prime spot on one’s Letterboxd profile. It’s a sobering, daunting, anxiety-filled exercise. Movie fans like me have so many different favorite films, and distilling one’s tastes into <i>four</i> <i>measley films</i> is a seemingly impossible challenge. So you’ve created countless hours of angst and hesitation amongst your users. Thanks for that.</p><p>The four films pinned to my profile are <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2bbs\"><i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/27Vw\"><i>The Empire Strikes Back</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a6Q\"><i>Rear Window</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b8e\"><i>Back to the Future</i></a>. In short, they’re probably the films I’ve seen most in my lifetime—each of them has layers that I’m still peeling back and discovering. And three out of four of them touch upon one of my basic thesis points I’ve been trying to make for decades: that blockbuster Hollywood filmmaking doesn’t have to be brain-dead drivel. We’re drowning in the myth that giant, spectacle-filled movies are almost doomed to be mindless, soulless pieces of garbage.</p><p><i>Raiders</i>, <i>Empire</i>, and <i>Back to the Future</i> are examples to the contrary, and there are countless others in every generation of cinema. When we reward mindless spectacle films with the odd defense “just turn your brain off at the door”, we’re doing cinema a disservice and literally giving approval to studios and filmmakers to make dumb, disposable junk-food entertainment. I don’t think it has to be this way, and those four movies are evidence. Those three were all released within a five-year period, and all within a formative period for me as a moviegoer. Moments of each of those movies are forever burned into my brain, and <i>Rear Window</i> only gets better with age.</p><p>As an aside, some folks also think that their tastes need to be forever frozen in time, for fear of seeming hypocritical or wishy washy, which makes choosing the four films that much harder. I take the point of view that everyone’s tastes change over time. Just like one’s literal taste buds—foods we abhorred when we were kids or teenagers we end up loving as adults, and vice versa. Why can’t that be the same with art? A movie someone thought was art-house garbage as a kid might end up being an absolute revelation when seen as an adult. It’s okay to evolve—there’s no reward at the end of your life for never changing your tastes. This is a long way of saying you’ve tortured your members with the four faves feature, and how dare you.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Which film gave you that moment of clarity where you knew you had to be in the world of VFX?<br/></b>If movies like <i>Raiders</i> and <i>Back to the Future</i> inspired me to want to do something, anything in movies, it was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/james-cameron/\">the films of Jim Cameron</a> that inspired me to get into visual effects. I was always fascinated with camera tricks, puppets, model photography, optical compositing, but with the advent of digital visual effects, I watched the progression of how they could be used to tell stories with great anticipation. One could look at Cameron’s films and see how a master uses every tool available to help build character and tell a story.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aQY\"><i>The Terminator</i></a>, Cameron relied on classic movie tricks like rear projection, model photography and stop-motion animation combined with innovative live-action puppets. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29PA\"><i>Aliens</i></a> advanced upon these techniques as well, and with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/26mK\">The Abyss</a>,</i> computer graphics were thrown into the mix. I was especially intrigued with Cameron’s storytelling process when it came to the highly experimental pseudopod sequence, which was ultimately created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, with computer graphics optically composited onto film. He wrote the scene in such a way that he could ultimately remove the sequence entirely without ruining his movie if the experiment was a horrible failure. This type of forethought and imagination was inspiring to me.</p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aGY\"><i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i></a> came out just as I was entering college, and everything that Cameron and ILM learned on <i>The Abyss</i> was turned up to eleven with their work on the T-1000 liquid-metal villain. <i>Terminator 2</i> is a veritable showcase of every single visual effects technique available at the time—all executed with incredible precision and quality, all in service to the film’s narrative and building character. It’s an absolute gem. It was the combination of <i>The Abyss</i> and <i>Terminator 2</i>, and Cameron with ILM’s iterative progression between the films, that inspired me to want to work in visual effects. I wanted to be a part of that process of problem-solving and storytelling.</p><p><b>I know you’ve been showing your daughter movies during downtime in the pandemic. Any luck inducting her into the cinephile life?<br/></b>Well, both my wife and I went to film school; she has had an accomplished career in movies on her own, and we’re both monstrous movie fans, so I guess it was inevitable that our kids would also be into it. Our thirteen-year-old daughter is at that wonderful age where she can watch more adult-oriented movies, so the floodgates have opened to a whole new world of movies. Showing her <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2awY\"><i>Alien</i></a> and <i>Aliens</i> was a huge moment, as was <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a7u\"><i>Die Hard</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a5e\"><i>Jaws</i></a>. I can’t wait to show her <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2DjO\"><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i></a>. She’s becoming quite a gifted filmmaker herself, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/1258982695767437312?s=20\">and enjoys film editing the most</a>. She’s dying for me to teach her how to use Final Cut Pro.</p><p><b>Which film that you worked on is the ten-year-old you inside you squealing the most about in excitement?<br/></b>I’m incredibly lucky to have worked on a lot of great movies. One thing moviegoers might not understand is that someone in Hollywood can be absolutely wonderful at their job—for decades at the top of their field—and never work on a “good” movie. It’s the luck of the draw. So I completely understand how lucky I’ve been. If you told a ten-year-old me that old-man-Todd would ultimately work on several <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/star-wars-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Star Wars</i></a> movies, a few <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/star-trek-alternate-reality-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Star Trek</i></a> movies, a Jim Cameron movie (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Efm\"><i>Avatar</i></a>), and a couple of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/mission-impossible-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a> films, ten-year-old Todd would have probably laughed in your face.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Your filmography is impressive. I can smell the popcorn from your <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0891445/#visual_effectsMovie\">IMDb page</a>. Can you explain the responsibilities of your roles?<br/></b>In broad terms, I’m a lead artist and sometimes supervisor. I’m focused on compositing, which is the layering of elements together to create an image. Compositing is as old as photography itself, and for its first century, compositing was done photochemically with film. Now we can layer and manipulate imagery in the digital world, which gives us a lot more flexibility and freedom. When I’m an artist on a film production, I take real-world photography, computer graphics renders, explosions and fire and smoke photographed on a stage, and other elements and blend them together to make a final image.</p><p>As a lead, I help with look development on a sequence, usually by tackling the hero shots of the sequence and figuring out how we’re actually going to accomplish these shots. And when I’m supervising I work closely with the visual effects supervisor on all aspects of the work, from all of the technical requirements of the show to the aesthetic. It’s all basically problem-solving and telling stories with images.</p><p><b>Which common misconceptions about VFX grate you the most?<br/></b>There are so many common bizarre tropes about digital visual effects, which makes it clear we’ve done a poor job in visual effects explaining what we do. To make things worse, there’s this absolutely garbage attitude that digital effects are in fact the enemy of good cinema, especially in contrast with “practical effects”. I’m not even going to get into the details of this non-argument, since it’s made in bad faith or complete ignorance. It’s not helpful when the studios and certain film directors not-so-subtly push this argument into the mainstream.</p><p>Here’s the deal: making these movies is really, really hard. Filmmakers should use whatever techniques they need to get their vision to the screen. Successful directors and visual effects supervisors are not tied to any particular dogma—in fact, the best cinema experiences are created by dedicated professionals who collaborate with other disciplines. For example, you will frequently hear visual effects supervisors say “oh, this gag should absolutely be a puppet that the actors will interact with” when it’s appropriate.</p><p>But for some reason this non-argument persists, and from my perspective it means that we in the visual effects community need to tell the story of our role in cinema with greater clarity. I’m doing what I can; reminding folks that we’re all artists collaborating to bring a vision to the screen, and it doesn’t really matter what tools we use so long as the vision is created.</p><p><b>What’s a film with overlooked visual effects that we should all take a closer look at?<br/></b>In order to answer this question, I scrolled back at all the movies I’ve watched—the last few years I’ve averaged about 50 movies a year—and nearly every single one had some visual effects in it. This includes the small art-house films, as well as the blockbusters. I’m a huge fan of the marriage between stunts, physical effects and digital effects, so the work in the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/john-wick-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>John Wick</i></a> films and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/blDk\"><i>Atomic Blonde</i></a> has been a real joy to discover. Just last year, as an example, there were a ton of visual effects in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gXGc\"><i>Uncut Gems</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hTha\"><i>Parasite</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gnV6\"><i>Us</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/aSVk\"><i>Little Women</i></a>, so when we talk about visual effects, we’re not just talking about <i>Star Wars</i> or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/studio/marvel-studios/\">Marvel</a>. It’s all of cinema.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>You frequently point out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus\">split-diopter</a> shots on Twitter. Which is your favorite?<br/></b>Split diopters are wild, aren’t they? Generally speaking, they completely take you out of the movie, because they’re so rarely used. Audiences are accustomed to the visual vocabulary of cinema where only one plane of depth can be in focus at any one time. Split diopters throw that vocabulary out the window, which is what makes them so much fun!</p><p>Right now, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/1170194405988290561?s=20\">my favorite one is an odd one</a>. It’s from <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b6i\">The Untouchables</a>,</i> where Capone is seated at an opera performance. The opera singer is in the extreme foreground and Capone is in the extreme background, and the shot zooms in on Capone during the performance. The distorted split line is invisible, since the split between lenses is against darkness. It’s a wonderfully weird shot, and you don’t quite know what you’re looking at.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>As a member of the film industry, how do you feel about your responsibility to be sincere about your film reviews on social media? Some noted filmmakers on Letterboxd choose to be <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lilfilm/\">coy</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chad_hartigan/\">brutally honest</a> or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jimmycthatsme/\">exclusively celebratory</a>, for instance.<br/></b>I really don’t think it’s worth anyone’s time to hear me talk about movies I didn’t like. In private, I have no problem criticizing movies I think are garbage. But in public, I’d rather use what little influence I have to celebrate the spirit of movies. There are so many great movies being made, and so many great movies that have never been seen by large audiences. It just seems like a waste of time talking about ones that didn’t hit the mark. I’d rather use my energy to talk about art I love.</p><p><b>What are the best films Letterboxd members <a href=\"https://boxd.it/55Z08\">haven’t seen</a>?<br/></b>From that wonderful list?

Are you planning on moving to New Zealand in a worst-case scenario? You are welcome! (After mandatory quarantines, of course.)<br/></b>Funny you ask, because another cinema pet peeve of mine is that “only some movies are political”. Not true at all—all movies are political. I think a lot about how Roger Ebert thought about the movies:</p><blockquote><p>“We all are born with a certain package. We are who we are: where we were born, who we were born as, how we were raised. We’re kind of stuck inside that person, and the purpose of civilization and growth is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people. And for me, the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. It lets you understand a little bit more about different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.”</p></blockquote><p>And if a movie doesn’t have a clear political point of view, it has a ‘status quo’ political point of view, as in “everything is fine and nothing needs to change”. For the love of all that is good in the world, please vote, America.</p>"

A rush of adrenaline, a dose of perspective, a guttural scream—all of these outlets for stress are enabled in the controlled environment of a scary movie, made better when it’s a shared experience, and made <i>even</i> better when there’s a crossover with another genre we love.</p><p>There’s something so satisfying about successfully weaving the gleeful unpredictability of horror into the rigid structures and tonal beats of another genre. The perverse thrill of being both terrified and aroused by an erotic-horror; the eerie loneliness of a horror-western; the cathartic release from scream-laughing at a comedy-horror. When characters’ emotional journeys hit all of the genre beats, the very best of these genre-fluid efforts sit with the very best of cinema: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2awY\"><i>Alien</i></a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Vs\"><i>American Psycho</i></a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29J8\"><i>Shaun of the Dead</i></a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Qr0\"><i>Let the Right One In</i></a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29fC\"><i>Don’t Look Now</i></a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\"><i>Midsommar</i></a>. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7eQy\"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a>.</p><p>I spent the Hallowe’en season curating a selection of recent horror-hybrids for your trembling pleasure. ’Cos lord knows we all need a good scream right now.</p><!--figure[1]--><h2><i><b>The Wind</b></i> (2018)</h2><p><b>Horror meets western in a tale of prairie madness.</b></p><p>The western genre has been dominated by men’s stories, with Hollywood itself built upon the lie of a lone white man against the land and its first occupants. But women were always there, and Emma Tammi’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jK5I\"><i>The Wind</i></a> is the first semi-mainstream horror-western to center a woman on the Great Plains. Like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1j9s\">the 1928 silent Lillian Gish film</a>, writer Teresa Sutherland also pulls from Dorothy Scarborough’s best-known novel, as well as <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/features/the-disturbing-real-life-story-behind-tiff-midnight-madness-title-the-wind/5132716.article\">real stories of</a> “prairie madness”, which tended to affect women the most, as they were often alone for long periods. <i>The Wind</i> draws on the atmospheric tension of the western to build a genuinely spooky, non-linear narrative. It’s a creepy, beautiful psychodrama about madness in isolation, and whether the demons are out there, or in here. (Our own Jack Moulton <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/183930664113/emma-tammi-qa\">interviewed Tammi</a> for the film’s release.)</p><!--figure[2]--><h2><i><b>Sputnik</b></i> (2020)</h2><p><b>Horror meets Sci-Fi in Russian nod to 1980s greats.</b></p><p>First time director Egor Abramenko wanted to replicate the look and feel of sci-fi films of the 1980s, such as <i>Alien</i> and <i>Solaris</i>. Science fiction cinema is “<a href=\"http://inverse.com/entertainment/sputnik-movie-ending-explained\">a young, uncharted territory for Russian filmmakers</a>,” he has said, but this debut suggests he knows his stuff, taking familiar elements and making them specific to his style. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1qO2Kn\">As Ben writes</a>: “The cinematography was spot on for the sci-fi horror genre and the score was powerfully brooding. I loved the aesthetics and the production design too, but the biggest shout-out is for the SFX and creature effects team because they make it all look so good on a relatively low budget.”</p><!--figure[3]--><h2><i><b>Relic</b></i> (2020)</h2><p><b>Horror meets drama in haunting family slow-burn.</b></p><p>Love me a jump-scare, but not all horror needs them. The dread that sets in when a story comes from an all-too-real place is often more terrifying. Metaphor-horror is one of the surest avenues for exploring the slow-burning grief and ongoing trauma that come with unavoidable life events. Premiering at Sundance 2020 to warm reviews, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jEwS\"><i>Relic</i></a> follows Kay (Emily Mortimer) and Sam (Bella Heathcote) as they watch family matriarch Edna (Robyn Nevin) lose her grip on reality. This small-budget horror has some serious A-listers attached—Jake Gyllenhaal and Anthony and Joe Russo serve as executive producers, an indication of their faith in director Natalie Erika James’s vision. And trust me, <i>Relic</i> delivers the horror <i>and</i> the drama. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ofQEr\">As Liam writes</a>: “The film has atmosphere to burn and James uses the horror toolbox to push every button she can, without sacrificing story or character, in order to bring the audience into a world with characters that feel emotionally real, even as reality breaks down around them.”</p><!--figure[4]--><h2><i><b>Tigers Are Not Afraid</b></i> (2017)</h2><p><b>Horror meets fantasy on the haunted streets of Mexico.</b></p><p>Since <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28No\"><i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i></a>, horror-fantasy has seen a resurgence in modern cinema. A recent Mexican entry—and one of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/48z62\">Letterboxd’s highest-rated horror films directed by a woman</a>—is Issa López’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bIww\"><i>Tigers Are Not Afraid</i></a>, a film that weaves fantasy elements with the ugly reality of homelessness, childhood trauma, and the Mexican drug cartel. As a haunting story about a haunted neighborhood, there’s something about combining kids and fantasy that makes this kind of trauma-horror more palatable. “I didn’t expect to cry during a horror film, but here we are,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1pbFBH\">writes Michael</a>. “It’s real and gritty, but also fantastical and supernatural. It’s a wonderful blend of genre.” López is influenced by the movies of Guillermo del Toro, but several Letterboxd reviewers also note strong Luis Buñuel/Los Olvidados vibes. (If you’ve seen the film, an earlier ending was intended to be much bleaker than what’s in the recent cut. Check out López’s <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3614328/director-issa-lopez-reveals-grim-original-ending-tigers-not-afraid-teases-werewolf-western-movie-update-interview-post-5-5/\">Bloody Disgusting interview</a> to learn about that original ending.)</p><!--figure[5]--><h2><b><i>Spring</i></b> (2014)</h2><p><b>Horror meets romance in the ravishing gory glory of Italy.</b></p><p>In<i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/76Sm\">Spring</a></i>, love conquers all—even when your partner is a primordial Cthulhu tentacle monster. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are the reigning princes of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/84MK\">Lovecraftian cinema</a>. Their films draw from elements of HP Lovecraft’s horror creations, no matter what genre they cross, and <i>Spring</i> is quintessentially genre-fluid—both genuinely romantic and deeply terrifying, based not in fantasy, but in science and realism. “A profoundly moving romance with deep mythological underpinnings,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5p3yl\">says Blain</a>, “which steadily manifests into grotesque body horror”. <i>Spring</i> rests on the chemistry between the leads, Lou Taylor Pucci and Nadia Hilker. It might bring a tear or two to your eyes (as it did mine). <a href=\"http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/2015/05/18/spring-interview-with-justin-benson-and-aaron-moorhead/\">This Electric Sheep interview</a> with Benson and Moorhead gives an in-depth look at its genesis and production, on location in Italy. (Keep an eye out for the pair’s new film, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/k3M2\"><i>Synchronic</i></a>, in theaters now and coming to VOD in January. It’s another genre-bender, this time marrying buddy-flick elements with a sci-fi premise, and featuring an horrific sequence specifically related to Anthony Mackie’s character.)</p><!--figure[6]--><h2><i><b>The Wolf of Snow Hollow</b></i> (2020)</h2><p><b>Horror meets whodunnit via incompetent cops.</b></p><p>After a relative drought of werewolf films, the hairy creatures are having quite a year. Writer, director and star Jim Cummings combines police procedural with grisly creature-feature in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oeu2\"><i>The Wolf of Snow Hollow</i></a>, elevating the mystery with unexpected comedy, courtesy of characters facing serious personal challenges and a townsfolk unable to agree as to whether it’s a murderous werewolf or a serial killer on the loose. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1qjeEJ\">As Jin writes</a>, “it’s less about the werewolf, and more about the destructive monsters of human nature”. Culminating in a twist I didn’t see coming, <i>The Wolf of Snow Hollow</i> is dedicated to co-star Robert Forster (<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aVO\">Jackie Brown</a></i>) in his final quirky, dry and charming film role. (Listen to our recent Letterboxd Show <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/letterboxd/episodes/11-Jim-Cummings-eksn5h\">podcast interview with Jim Cummings</a> to find out what it was like working with Forster.)</p><!--figure[7]--><h2><i><b>Get Out</b></i> (2017)</h2><p><b>Horror meets thriller meets phenomenally wicked social commentary.</b></p><p>Jordan Peele can do it all. He’s an hilarious comedian, a brilliant director and he understands the horror genre like no other. Most film lovers agree that his first feature film, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/eOCm\"><i>Get Out</i></a>, is one of the decade’s best horror thrillers. It’s one of the few films to break through the horror-film firewall at the Academy Awards (Peele won best original screenplay, and star Daniel Kaluuya was nominated for best actor). <i>Get Out</i> also ignited a “woke” horror subgenre of social commentary—a welcome shift from all the earnest period films about Americans overcoming racism by driving around in cars together. “Via a creative form of social critique,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dJ7MD\">writes Kevin</a>, “Peele does what horror filmmakers do best: draw from the everyday fears of our times and take them to the extreme. However, he also has a knack for transitioning between tones, and that’s where the beauty of the film lies.” <i>Get Out</i> works across genres because the scares are scary, the mystery is twisty, the laughs land in the pit of your stomach, and the final act is off the chain.</p><!--figure[8]--><h2><i><b>Vampires vs. the Bronx</b></i> (2020)</h2><p><b>Horror meets comedy in the neglected best borough.</b></p><p>In the new Netflix film <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kP9M\"><i>Vampires vs. the Bronx</i></a>, comedy and horror intersect in the borough most film productions tend to avoid when they hit up New York City as a backdrop. As gentrification threatens their hood, three streetwise Bronx kids not only have white-people problems, but pale, immortal-people problems, too. As the trio learns the rules of vampire-fighting (stakes, garlic, etc.), director Osmany Rodriguez—whose television credits are riddled with comedy—and co-writer Blaise Hemingway ensure it’s funny as hell, and funnier still if your Latinx or Black upbringing enables you to take the in-jokes to the next level. And there’s another level, still: a cultural comment that, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1nRZef\">writes Fred</a>, “manages to imbue a dusty genre mainstay with a vitally urgent message that is very much the kind we need this October. The idea behind it is so obvious that the fact that this effortlessly embraces it and wrings […] such thoroughly resonant pulpy entertainment out of it is some kind of genius.” <i>Vampires vs. the Bronx</i> also earns points from locals, like me, who love recognizing landmarks that only Bronxites would know. Confirms why if you come to the BX, if you don’t start nothin’ won’t be nothin’.</p><!--figure[9]--><h2><i><b>Anna and the Apocalypse</b></i> (2017)</h2><p><b>Horror meets musical meets… Christmas!</b></p><p>A zombie apocalypse causes the small town of Little Haven to break into song and dance in John McPhail’s horror-musical <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gwcE\"><i>Anna and the Apocalypse</i></a>. Among its Letterboxd fans, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/JFSHP\">Kyle writes</a>: “It’s an arduous task to tackle and combine so many genres, but it refreshingly delivers all around with a crisp, clean and technically sound final product.” Some terrifying moments will make the audience forget this is a musical, and vice versa. There aren’t nearly enough <a href=\"https://boxd.it/45ac4\">horror musicals</a>, despite the cult success of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1a3q\"><i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i></a>. If this film does one good thing, it might be to bring more musical fans over to the dark side. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/MNOMJ\">As David writes</a>: “I’m not really all that much of a fan of zombies, like, they’re the most useless and ugly fictional creatures, period, but this… I can’t put into words how good this is.” It would thrive on Broadway year-round (if theaters ever open again).</p><!--figure[10]--><h2><i><b>Shadow in the Cloud</b></i> (2020)</h2><p><b>Horror meets war in Roseanne Liang’s mid-air feminist fantasy.</b></p><p>Because war itself is apparently not terrifying enough, filmmakers have long seen fit to inject supernatural elements into the battlefield—whether it’s Michael Mann’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1umW\"><i>The Keep</i></a>, this year’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/msUE\"><i>Ghosts of War</i></a>, or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5729E\">various Nazisploitation films</a>. Writer-director Roseanne Liang’s TIFF Midnight Madness winner <a href=\"https://boxd.it/pah6\"><i>Shadow in the Cloud</i></a>, starring Chloë Grace Moretz as WWII pilot Maude Garrett, takes the very fact of Maude’s gender as its starting point and throws all manner of mid-air evil her way. Trapped in the lower ball turret of a B-17, her fight to protect a top-secret package devolves into a one-woman action spectacle. It’s bat-shit B-movie in the extreme, as classic war tropes—this story couldn’t take place in any other circumstance—meet classic monster tropes, with the added tension of a bunch of gaslighting dudes ramping up the stakes. (Another war-horror of note is Babak Anvari’s 2016 Iranian film <a href=\"https://boxd.it/d1uG\"><i>Under the Shadow</i></a>, lensed by <i>Shadow in the Cloud</i>’s cinematographer, Kit Fraser.)</p><!--figure[11]--><h2><i><b>Overlord</b></i> (2018)</h2><p><b>Horror meets action meets Nazisploitation.</b></p><p>How does one make something action-packed and scary? Honestly, horror-action crossovers are the hardest to pull off (looking at you, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/resident-evil-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Resident Evil</i> franchise</a>), but <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fAwm\"><i>Overlord</i></a> is an outlier for a few reasons. Let’s keep it real: most Black folks don’t live to see the end of horror movies, but at the center of <i>Overlord</i> is actor Jovan Adepo as private first class Edward Boyce, the film’s clear hero. It’s a zombie flick grounded by writers Billy Ray and Mark L. Smith in the realism of war, with director Julius Avery ensuring the horror elements never take the audience out of the WWII environment. It doesn’t work for everyone, but for fans <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1o9CSH\">like Coolnik</a>, <i>Overlord</i> is “a rather exhilarating and more than capable enough action-horror outing,” with, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/yCTrN\">writes Todd</a>, “many great, long action shots—I don’t always need 45 minutes of exposition.”</p>"

I was still in that mode of trying to scrutinize everything and implement my final notes, and then all of a sudden the movie was done and I could never touch it again. It certainly was a surreal transition to make that quickly.</p><p>It was also extremely gratifying to see people respond to it for the first time. We knew that we weren’t making a movie that was for all tastes but when you’re reading the first response from the first person who’s ever reviewed it and they’re picking up on stuff you intended, you start to let your spine unclench a little bit. You can sort of finally say goodbye to the process of making something and enjoy the process of people interacting with it.</p><p><b>Have you been reading the Letterboxd reviews?<br/></b>Obsessively. I’ve been refreshing Letterboxd all the time. I’ve been joking with my editor and composer a lot about how people posting their reviews on Letterboxd, on their YouTube channel, or other little outlets would never expect the filmmakers to be instantly reading their reviews.</p><p><b>You’re also a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3g6V\">member</a>! How do you use Letterboxd?<br/></b>I’ve always been a big film nerd. Ever since I was a teenager I was making lists at the end of the year and obsessing over an order that would always change. A friend of mine, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/matthew-miller-2/\">Matthew Miller</a>, who produced <i>The Dirties</i>, recommended that I hop on Letterboxd and instantly I was going through the library rating and organizing everything, and it became a real slippery slope. I remember spending hours on it in the first week.</p><p>Now, after actually having made a movie that’s on a larger scale, I’ve found that my sensitivity has changed a lot in the last year. I’m less inclined to give a star rating. I’m happy just to catalog the film so I can reflect on it and just use the ‘like’ button. That’s been an interesting shift in my relationship with how I see movies after having finally completed this project.</p><p><b>I know this idea had been gestating a while for you, what was the seed of the story?<br/></b>I’d written a short film in film school, which I never shot, that was about a child detective who was still a child and was solving grisly murders. I was obsessed with the first season of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362359/\"><i>The OC</i></a> and I thought Adam Brody was so funny. I was impressed with how he broke out of the formula of that show. I knew he was someone I really wanted to work with and we happened to cross paths at Sundance because <i>The Dirties</i> was premiering at Slamdance. It was clear to us that we shared a similar sense of humor and taste.</p><p>I was looking back on my old ideas and I saw an opportunity to re-conceive this one for him because I immediately identified with the protagonist. I’ve always known I wanted to be a filmmaker and thus had that sense of expectation where people would joke: “he’ll grow up to be the next Spielberg!” It’s incredible encouragement when you’re young but it also creates this unfortunate sense of pressure where you’re beholden to a future that you actually haven’t achieved or lived.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>When I graduated film school, I was suddenly left in the space of my own apartment where now it was up to me to actually make this happen, to write and direct a feature film. The process acquires this unfortunate pressure because it’s not just about watching ideas unfold in front of me, I also have something to prove. I was at a point in my life where I was doing a lot of writing and not having great success in terms of actually finishing a script so this premise resonated with me and I saw an opportunity for people to connect to this character in their own way.</p><p><b>I revisited <i>The Dirties</i> after watching <i>The Kid Detective</i> and I finally understood why there were those huge <i>The OC</i> posters in Matt and Owen’s edit suite. I assume that was your idea?<br/></b>Yeah, it was. We were all big fans of that show. The cultural references they made were things that were important to us at that particular moment and we loved Seth Cohen [Brody’s character]. When I ran into Adam at Sundance, I shared a link to <i>The Dirties,</i> forgetting that his face was in the background of about twenty minutes of our movie. We were back in our hotel that night and it suddenly just occurred to us—“wait a minute, shit. We should probably warn him that his face is a big character!”</p><p><b>How did you conduct your research into detective work?<br/></b>What excited me about this premise was the character and not so much the genre. I think the genre is alluring in a sense that it’s so hallowed. The set pieces are so familiar in terms of the PI office, the receptionist and the glass of scotch. That stuff was all super cool and enticing, but I was never a big mystery person. I was intimidated by the process of writing because it felt very much outside of my wheelhouse.</p><p>The first thing I did was buy a bunch of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Chandler\">Raymond Chandler</a> books from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Marlowe\">Philip Marlowe series</a>. I read those super quickly and thought they were super funny. I also read a bunch of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown\">Encyclopedia Brown</a> books. So, the world of <i>The Kid Detective</i> exists between these two realms. I started watching bad TV procedurals where the detectives try and find the victim within the span of 42-minutes just to absorb as much as I possibly could.</p><p><b>Here you have a whimsical directorial approach while the film reflects upon a cynical, changing world. In comparison, <i>The Dirties</i> also deals with young adult trauma but couldn’t be further from this in style. Can you talk about your use of juxtaposition this time around?<br/></b>There was no more fun experience than shooting <i>The Dirties</i>. It really was a film made by four best friends having an endless sleepover in their parents’ basement. That’s where the energy, the life, and the humor of the film comes from. We were always relying on the darker component of the dramatic payoff to provide us with a structure so that we could goof around as much as we wanted knowing that it wasn’t all for nothing. Those dramatic stakes would provide it with a different kind of technical legitimacy. We didn’t have any money to make it but it didn’t have to look like a big Hollywood film because it was made by the characters.</p><p>It wasn’t a conscious decision to recreate the same dynamic with <i>The Kid Detective</i> in terms of dealing with dramatic issues in a very light way. The premise felt immediately funny but it also felt immediately sad and painful. I wanted to find a way to wrap them together without forfeiting the humor or the reality of the characters. It’s interesting how a lot of people are responding to the way the movie reveals itself to be dark because, for me, this was always inevitable. If you’re going to tell a story about a stunted adult, like a kid detective who never really grows up, the only way for the character to grow up is to confront something that is so sinister that it would break them from their selfishness.</p><p><b>Which <a href=\"https://boxd.it/17cL8\">detective movies</a> most influenced <i>The Kid Detective</i>?<br/></b>The biggest films that were in my head when I was writing this movie—and also in terms of our aesthetic—were <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29vU\"><i>Chinatown</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29BI\"><i>Blue Velvet</i></a>. Chinatown was a movie that I had more of a relationship with as a teenager than I did the older Humphrey Bogart movies like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29iQ\"><i>The Big Sleep</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29c4\"><i>The Maltese Falcon</i></a>. <i>Blue Velvet</i> also has a suburban setting that reveals this darker underbelly—two characters driving around in a convertible, interviewing people, and putting themselves in greater and greater risk. Those were the movies that we wanted you to be able to put the film on the shelf with.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Which film made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b>This is an easy one for me. I was a very big fan of Jim Carrey when I was eleven and I remember seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/25RW\"><i>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</i></a> for the first time and having my mind blown. I didn’t even know what some of those jokes were referring to, but I was so delighted by his energy and the absurdity of that movie. It invited this ferocious interest in acting and consequentially, the world of film. I got really excited when I heard he was working on his first dramatic feature and that it was going to be directed by Peter Weir since I was already a fan of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aSg\"><i>Dead Poets Society</i></a>.</p><p>I remember going to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/18U8\"><i>The Truman Show</i></a> with my family on the first night that it played and the projector broke about an hour into the movie. I was broken—I knew that was I watching my favorite movie that I’d ever seen. I was absolutely blown away by the world and the story. After about 30 minutes, the theater staff came out and started offering vouchers to see it again but I wouldn’t let my parents leave—I said “no, we have to stay and finish it!”—and then I was rewarded with what remains my favorite movie ending ever.</p><p>That was the point when my interest shifted from wanting to be in front of the camera and the center of attention. I was kind of the class clown as a child. If you’d asked at the time, I’d say I wanted to be a comedian. This was the moment where I decided I wanted to tell stories and start writing scripts.</p><p><b>Which coming-of-age protagonist did you relate to the most as a teenager?<br/></b>Not super original, but I was obsessed with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye\"><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i></a> as a teenager. I don’t know if I necessarily saw my experience reflected in a movie—I’m sure it’s out there. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TAO\"><i>Rushmore</i></a> was another film that Adam and I used as a reference when we were pitching this movie, in how <i>The Kid Detective</i> exists between that and <i>Chinatown</i>. It’s also about a character dealing with his own expectations of himself and ultimately having to evolve out of his selfishness.</p><p>I think that there’s something about the coming-of-age genre that is very special to me and I continue to really appreciate and recognize it. I really enjoyed <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JTQ\">Adventureland</a>,</i> which came out about eleven years ago and it’s sort of underrated. I guess in its own way, <i>Blue Velvet</i> is a coming-of-age story too. Those are the ones that are the top of my list.</p><p><b>What are your favorite <a href=\"https://boxd.it/CwEa\">Canadian films</a> that really could not be made anywhere else but Canada?<br/></b>It seems I should have an immediate answer to that question. It just proves how bad Canadians are at celebrating themselves. There was a movie called <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2IVe\"><i>Monsieur Lazhar</i></a> that stars Sophie Nélisse, who’s the leading actress in our film. It was her first film role at eleven and it’s an incredibly sensitive and quiet movie that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars that year. That’s a really amazing example of Canadian filmmaking at its best.</p><p><b>If you’ve had time to watch any films this year, what is your favorite film of 2020 so far?<br/></b>This is another tough one for me because I was honestly so immersed in trying to complete <i>The Kid Detective</i>—we were editing intensely from the very beginning of the year and throughout the lockdown. I was so exhausted by that process that I lost track of what was happening in terms of new releases, so I watched quite a few old movies and there were a few movies I revisited.</p><p>The movie that probably had the biggest impact on me was <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\">Midsommar</a>,</i> from last year. I couldn’t believe the precision and how unshakable it was in terms of those images. It got me excited again in the way that sometimes you feel when you have to see a movie more than once in order to truly see it, because the first time you’re dispensing your expectations. Maybe you wanted to like it or maybe you didn’t want to like it, but the second time you don’t have the same anticipation, and as a result you notice things that you didn’t notice previously.</p>"

Ultimately, I think we love music movies because we simply love music, and want to know more about the ephemeral qualities of those who make it. That’s certainly why famous directors often throw themselves into music films—there’s nothing more unknowable and magical than a musician’s brain.</p><p>While he’s “no psychologist”, the attraction is as clear as day to filmmaker John Scheinfeld, who has documented musicians including<a href=\"https://boxd.it/etOc\"> John Coltrane</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/xpW\">Harry Nilsson</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Oz2\">John Lennon</a>, and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/ryme\">Herb Alpert</a>: “Music is the universal language. It touches us emotionally, it touches us intellectually. And what comes along with that is if somebody’s music really impacts us in a significant way, we want to know more about that artist.

Lee’s cameras add intimacy and suspense, and importantly, bring a democratic vibe to it all. While Broadway tickets are mostly for the well-to-do, this film shouts “Come in! All are welcome!” We’re not just watching; we’re in it, we’re above it, we’re around it, we’re on stage, wrapped in a celebratory, cerebral knitting-back-together of America through song.

If you’ve never heard ‘Our Lips Are Sealed’ or ‘We Got the Beat’, fix that, now. “Ellwood allows her film to be a celebration of the punk-rock scene and of kick-ass women, a feminist documentary through and through,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hjXSP\">writes Andrew Chrzanowski on Letterboxd</a>. “<i>The Go-Gos</i> doesn’t shy away from the vitriol and chauvinism faced by the band even in their first tour of England along with Madness and The Specials, and the obstacles faced by a group of all women and with a female manager as well in a male-dominated industry.” <i>Streaming on Showtime.</i></p><p><i><b>Pair with:</b></i> <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oijW\">On the Record</a></i>.

Lee follows wildly skilled DJs including Alison Wonderland, Rezz, Tygapaw and Tokimonsta, and also dips into the past, shining light on electronic pioneers like Wendy Carlos and Delia Derbyshire (Whovians know her by her theme arrangement). Fun fact: women’s hands most likely built the Moog your boyfriend is noodling around on—that’s what being an expert in quilting qualifies you for. There’s literally no reason for EDM to discriminate on the basis of gender, so when things settle into new-normal and we’re allowed to cut loose again, demand women on the bill.

In <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oHqy\">OUTDEH—The Youth of Jamaica</a>,</i> German filmmaker Louis Josek takes a portrait of three twenty-something Jamaican men with low-key but serious ambitions for themselves, and the self-belief to match. One of those is rapper Bakersteez, whose anxiety and fear of crowds sits in opposition to his desire to be on stage. The trio tell their own stories, move at their own pace, figuring out the meaning of manhood and saying things wise beyond their years as they dream of a new Jamaica. It’s like watching a coming-of-age tale in real time. <i>Watch it <a href=\"https://www.redbull.com/int-en/films/outdeh\">for free</a>.</i></p><p><i><b>Pair with:</b></i> <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/3aT6\">Marley</a></i>. Re-released this year with additional footage to celebrate what would have been Bob Marley’s 75th birthday, Kevin Macdonald’s family-sanctioned life of the reggae master is as definitive as it’s probably possible to get. <i>Available to rent on VOD.</i></p><p><!--figure[6]--><h2><i>Coachella—20 Years in the Desert</i></h2></p><p><b>For reliving the pungent joys of festival culture and sweaty strangers.</b></p><p>Made to celebrate Coachella’s twentieth anniversary, and released in April, after things had already turned to custard, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/pFlI\"><i>Coachella—20 Years in the Desert</i></a> is a monument to the tens of thousands of bookers, roadies, sound techs, riggers, caterers, drivers and other beloved live-industry contractors currently unable to bring music dreams to the people. The festival’s origin story, the search for the perfect spot, the wild curation ideas (Madonna in the dance tent!), the rise of the hip-hop headliners and their mega-productions—all that music industry content, told by Coachella’s creators, is fascinating. Rosanna Arquette hiring herself to wander around bagging backstage interviews is also adorable. But the music remains the reason to tune in. A spine-tingling Amy Winehouse. The Arcade Fire ball drop. Tupac’s hologram. Kanye’s fake mountain. Peter Murphy from Bauhaus hanging upside down! (Thank f—k their idea to release hundreds of bats into the crowd didn’t eventuate.) <i>Free to watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjwilAja7Lc\">on YouTube</a>.</i></p><p><b><i>Pair with:</i></b> <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/rOii\">BLΛƆKPIИK—Light Up the Sky</a>,</i> Caroline Suh’s doc about the first K-Pop group to ever perform at Coachella. It’s one of those corporate films that come as part and parcel of the pop product these days (related: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/sgoe\"><i>Shawn Mendes: In Wonder</i></a> is due on Netflix November 23), but it’s nice to see well-trained, hard-working young people achieving their dreams, while missing their families. <i>On Netflix now.</i></p><p><!--figure[7]--><h2><i>How Can You Mend a Broken Heart</i></h2></p><p><b>For when you should be dancing.</b></p><p>The glorious hair. The shirts. The strut. The tight harmonies. It’s about time someone took on the hirsute and high-voiced Gibb brothers—Barry, Maurice and Robin—otherwise known as the best-selling musical artists of all time. Heavyweight producer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/frank-marshall/\">Frank Marshall</a> helms this Bee Gees documentary, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/rnng\">How Can You Mend a Broken Heart</a></i>, which is gaining early praise at festivals for including the creators of disco in the conversation. “There aren’t many music documentaries that can effectively shine a spotlight on social issues while still keeping the artist at the center of the conversation,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1oxUHb\">writes Mat Messa</a>. “Black people and gay people started a lot of cool things they rarely get credit for and the club owner in this represents a lot of quieted voices,” agrees <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1nKLr1\">Jeremiah Reynolds</a>, adding, “One of my big takeaways is how art needs space. Quality innovation requires obsessive focus.” <i>Coming to HBO and HBO Max later this year.</i></p><p><i><b>Pair with:</b></i> <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/r5Gu\">Tiny Tim—King for a Day</a></i>, for more male falsetto, and the kind of story you couldn’t make up, lovingly assembled by Johan von Sydow<i>.</i> “Weird Al” Yankovic narrates the diaries of unlikely ukulele star Herbert Khaury, as friends and family members help to interrogate the fuzzy line between freak and genius. <i>On the festival circuit.</i></p><p><!--figure[8]--><h2><i>Herb Alpert Is…</i></h2></p><p><b>For horny nostalgia—and a reassurance that not all rich people suck.</b></p><p>As well as just being toe-tappingly delightful, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ryme\">Herb Alpert Is…</a></i> has a sincere message about using your creative powers for good. “This is a man who’s a true artist, but who has felt so much gratitude for the success that he’s had, that he really set out to make the world a better place,” director John Scheinfeld says. Read about the making of the film in <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/632706752856637440/treasure-hunting-music-documentaries\">our interview with Scheinfeld</a>. <i>Available in virtual cinemas and on VOD now</i>.</p><p><i><b>Pair with:</b></i> Regina King’s forthcoming dream-narrative <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oCUo\">One Night in Miami</a></i>, which also features Sam Cooke.

Hot on the heels of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/gWwK\">Gaga: Five Foot Two</a></i> came another megastar confessional, in which Taylor Swift grapples with how much of her voice—not her singing voice, but her, y’know, thoughts and opinions—she is prepared to have heard… and then, when she is ready to say what she really thinks, the fight to actually <i>be</i> heard. There’s comfort in seeing someone with all her privilege struggle. Plus, her New Zealand producer Joel Little is the approving chap we all need as we come up with silly lyrics on the spot. <i>Streaming on Netflix.</i></p><p><b><i>Pair with:</i></b> <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lRJO\">Yellow Rose</a></i>, an affecting indie drama about a Texan Filipina singer-songwriter whose country music ambitions are interrupted when ICE comes for her undocumented mother.

As <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1pxo4P\">Scout Tafoya writes on Letterboxd</a>, “I’m not made of stone: this wrecked me. Like I get it, it’s a doc selling an album for an evil corporation, but where else can you see the band play in studio not interrupted by voice-over or needlessly cutting away.

Abundant archive footage, animated sequences and family members (including MacGowan’s hilarious dad, who blames Creedence Clearwater Revival for his son’s ‘downfall’) help to round out the tale of the Christmas Day baby born into an austere, stout-fuelled family (“We pissed out the front door, yeah, and shit in the fields”), who became a punk superstar and an Irish icon. And, as is the way with Irish stories, there’s as much blarney as there is music, so if you’re here just for the Pogues, you have been warned. <i>Screening at DOC NYC November 11-19 (<a href=\"https://www.docnyc.net/film/crock-of-gold-a-few-rounds-with-shane-macgowan/\">tickets here</a>); in US theaters and on demand December 4.</i></p>"

The soundtrack drips with his sophisticated rhythms, and there are the requisite famous commentators, including Sting, Questlove and Billy Bob Thornton (who recalls getting horny for the <i>Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights</i> album cover). But the film’s best asset is Herb himself, alive and well, painting, sculpting, performing with his wife, Lani Hall (of Sérgio Mendes and Brasil ’66), and exercising his generous philanthropy.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>For all his saucy musicianship and outsized success—not explored in detail here is the cultural appropriation of Mariachi-style music by a white Californian—Alpert is a “grounded, warm and sensitive” introvert, says Scheinfeld. A fascinating turning point in the film involves a never-before-seen interview with Alpert on a Malibu clifftop. Scheinfeld found the interview in a pile of two-inch reels containing unused out-takes from a 1960s television special. “It was just one of those electric moments. Here it is, nobody knew it existed, and you could absolutely see Herb struggling to find the words, the emotional distress that he is in.”</p><p>Scheinfeld adds: “One of the things that I love so much about what I do is finding footage that no one else has seen before. Treasure-hunting. Herb is a saver. He had saved everything: photos, film, video, newspaper articles. Anything we could have possibly needed to tell his story was all in his vault.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/in/bill-teds-most-excellent-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">Bill and Ted</a></i> star and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/alex-winter/\">documentary filmmaker Alex Winter</a> struck archival gold, too, in his long journey to bring the story of experimental music legend Frank Zappa to the screen. Though this is Winter’s first ‘artist biography’, it’s clearly made by somebody who grew up around artists, and has a nerd’s focus on detail (his previous documentaries explore the deep web, blockchain, Napster, the Panama papers and more). <i>Zappa</i> is impressive in its scope, and generous in its shape, to the point where a working knowledge of the great experimental composer is not needed.</p><p>“Zappa was compelling to me because he was this incredible artist who was very, very engaged with his times,” Winter says. “He had a lot of facets to his nature, some of which seemed to be in complete collision with each other, and that interested me greatly.”</p><p>Like Alpert, Zappa was a saver of things. Once Winter and his producer Glen Zipper had Frank’s widow, Gail Zappa, on side, the doors to the family archives were opened wide. But the first part of the filmmaking process was to preserve that material, which required a Kickstarter campaign. Then it was a matter of building a story that would suit the non-conformist, highly improvisational composer. “I wasn’t interested in telling a conventional story because he’s such an unconventional person,” says Winter. “[Editor] Mike Nichols and I made a commitment at the beginning to create an Act One that would be aggressive enough to take you in whatever direction we wanted to take the film after that.”</p><!--figure[4]--><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/bSSs\"><i>Zappa</i></a> is a beautifully assembled and superbly told story about a man in conflict with himself and the times. A highlight is Bruce Bickford’s stop-motion animation, and the few gaps not filled by rich archive material are handled by several well-chosen interviewees—one of Winter’s favorite parts of filmmaking: “I’ve always bristled about this new world we’re in right now where people are disparaging field interviews, which they call ‘talking heads’ for some reason. To me it’s so incredibly disrespectful to your subjects and to the whole idea of subject portraiture. I love shooting portraits of people. I honestly could just make docs of just one person talking to camera after another and be very happy doing that.”</p><p>To get to the heart of his subject, Scheinfled employs a cute device with his guests, one which gives his film its title. Scheinfeld asks them to complete the sentence “Herb Alpert is…”, explaining “the thing that really struck me when I started to look into Herb’s story is that it’s much deeper, richer and more interesting than simply the Tijuana Brass hits of the 1960s.</p><p>“What I really saw was a renaissance man who has achieved success on his own terms on many levels. He is many things to many different people. One can see him as a performer, as an entrepreneur, as a discoverer of talent, as a sculptor and artist, and there are probably others as well.”</p><!--figure[5]--><p>Asked for their favorite music documentaries, Winter readily offers Robert Frank’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1bHG\">The Rolling Stones: Cocksucker Blue</a>s</i>, of which only bootleg copies are available. “<b></b>That was one of the things that made me really wanna try doing this kind of storytelling—where the filmmaker is kind of there, but not becoming an intrusive part of the storytelling, but you can’t have the storytelling without it.”</p><p><b></b></p><p>Scheinfeld, however, won’t comment on other music documentaries, “because I’m a very tough audience”. He recalls instead the documentary that got him interested in making documentaries: <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/3nxC\">Point of Order</a></i> (1964, directed by Emile de Antonio). “It was all about the American political landscape during the McCarthy era in the 1960s. It made a very interesting choice to just have no narrator, but to let the events from Congressional hearings in Washington play out to tell a story. It was really fascinating and made me want to look at more documentaries.”</p><p>“The power of films,” Scheinfeld adds, “is not only to entertain us and help us escape from daily life—and heaven knows with Covid-19 we all need to do that—but I think they can also inspire us to be better people, to be better artists, to do something to make the world a better place… without sounding too pretentious!”</p><p><b></b></p>"

It’s been 80 years; Netflix is likely banking on an audience of <i>Rebecca</i> virgins (the same kind of studio calculation that worked for Bradley Cooper’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/aXgc\">A Star is Born</a></i>). Plus, the new <i>Rebecca</i> is a Working Title affair; it has glamor, camp, Armie Hammer in a three-piece suit, the sunny South of France, sports cars, horses, the wild Cornish coast, Lily James in full dramatic heat, and—controversial!—a fresh twist on the denouement.</p><p>A big-budget thriller made for a streamer is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ben-wheatley-1/\">Wheatley</a> coming full circle, in a way: he made his name early on with viral internet capers and a blog (“Mr and Mrs Wheatley”) of shorts co-created with his wife and longtime collaborator, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/amy-jump/\">Amy Jump</a>. Between then and now, they have gained fans for their well-received low-to-no budget thrillers, including <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7tmo\"><i>High-Rise</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2z4g\"><i>Kill List</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/b2Ig\"><i>Free Fire</i></a> (which also starred Hammer).</p><p>Over Zoom, Wheatley spoke to Letterboxd about the process of scaling up, the challenge of casting already-iconic characters, and being a year-round horror lover. [The <i>Rebecca</i> plot discussion may be spoilery to some. Wheatley is specifically talking about the du Maurier version, not his film.]</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Can you tell us how you overcame any concerns in adapting a famous novel that already has a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aQa\">very famous adaptation</a>? How did you want to make a 1930s story relevant to modern audiences?<br/></b><i>Ben Wheatley:</i> When you go back to the novel and look at how it works, you see it’s a very modern book. [Author Daphne du Maurier is] doing stuff that people are still picking up the pieces of now. It’s almost like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone\">Rosetta Stone</a> of thrillers—it tells you everything on how to put a thriller together. The genre jumping and Russian-doll nature of the structure is so delicious. When you look at the characters in the book, they’re still popping up in other stuff—there’s Mrs Danvers in all sorts of movies.</p><p>It remains fresh because of its boldness. Du Maurier is writing in a way that’s almost like a dare. She’s going, “right, okay, you like romantic fiction do you? I’ll write you romantic fiction; here’s Maxim de Winter, he’s a widower, he’s a good-looking guy, and owns a big house. Here’s a rags-to-riches, Cinderella-style girl. They’re going to fall in love. Then I’m going to ruin romantic fiction for you forever by making him into a murdering swine and implicating you in the murder because you’re so excited about a couple getting away with it!”</p><p>That’s the happy ending—Maxim doesn’t go to prison. How does that work? He’s pretty evil by the end. It’s so subtly done that you only see the trap of it after you finish reading the book. That’s clearly represented in Jane Goldman’s adaptation that couldn’t be done in 1940 because of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code\">Hays Code</a>. That whole element of the book is missing [in Hitchcock’s <i>Rebecca</i>]. But I do really like this style of storytelling in the 1930s and ’40s that is not winky, sarcastic, and cynical. It’s going, “here’s Entertainment with a big ‘E’. We’re going to take you on holiday, then we’re gonna scare you, then we’re gonna take you around these beautiful houses that you would never get a chance to go around, and we’re gonna show you these big emotions.”</p><p><b>After <i>High-Rise</i>, you ended up circling back to more contained types of films, whereas <i>Rebecca</i> is your lushest and largest production. How was scaling up for you?<br/></b><i>Free Fire</i> does feel like a more contained film, but in many ways it was just as complicated and had the same budget as <i>High-Rise</i>, since it’s just in one space. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hXoE\"><i>Happy New Year, Colin Burstead</i></a> is literally a contained film, that’s right. What [the bigger budget] gave me was the chance to have a conversation where I say I want a hotel that’s full of people and no-one says you can’t have any people in it. You don’t have to shoot in a corner, so that scale is suddenly allowed.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>The other movies I did are seen as no-budget or, I don’t even know the word for how little money they are, and even though <i>High-Rise</i> and <i>Free Fire</i> were eight million dollars each, they’re still seen as ultra-low budget. This is the first film that I’ve done that’s just a standard Hollywood-style movie budget and it makes a massive difference. It gives you extra time to work. All the schemes you might have had to work out in order to cheat and get around faster, but now it’s fine, let’s only shoot two pages today. We can go out on the road and close down all of the south of France—don’t worry about all the holidaymakers screaming at you and getting cross! That side of it is great.</p><p><b>You had the challenge to cast iconic actors for iconic roles. What were you looking for in the casting? What points of reference did you give the actors?<br/></b>I don’t think we really talked about it, but [Armie Hammer] definitely didn’t watch the Hitchcock version. I can understand why he wouldn’t. There was no way he was going to accidentally mimic [Laurence] Olivier’s performance without seeing it and he just didn’t want to have the pressure of that. I think that’s quite right. It’s an 80-year-old film, it’s a beloved classic, and we’d be mad if we were trying to remake it. We’re not.</p><p>The thing about the shadow that the film cast is that it’s hard enough making stuff without thinking about other filmmakers. I’ve had this in the past where journalists ask me “what were your influences on the day?” and I wish I could say “it was a really complicated set of movies that the whole thing was based around”, but it’s not like that. When you watch documentaries about filmmakers screening loads of movies for their actors before they make something—it’s lovely, but it’s not something I’ve ever done.</p><p>The actual process of filmmaking is guiding actors and capturing emotion on set. That’s enough of a job without putting another layer of postmodern film criticism over the top of it—“we’ll use this shot from 1952, that will really make this scene sing!”—then you’re in a world of pain. Basically, it’s my interpretation of the adaptation. The book is its own place, and for something like <i>High-Rise</i>, [screenwriter Amy Jump] has the nightmare of sitting down with 112 pages of blank paper and taking a novel and smashing it into a script. That’s the hard bit.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Current industry news is not so great—cinemas are facing <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/10/cinema-stocks-teeter-wall-street-ponders-possible-amc-entertainment-bankruptcy-1234596738/\">bankruptcy</a>, film festivals in the USA are mostly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/letterboxd/status/1313649210269392897\">virtual</a>, Disney is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/disney-reorganizes-to-focus-on-streaming-direct-to-consumer.html\"><b>focusing on D</b>isney+ only</a>. How do you feel about a future where streaming dominates the market and the theatrical experience becomes, as we fear, an exclusive niche?<br/></b>Independent cinema was born out of very few movies. If you look at the history of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/299u\"><i>Eraserhead</i></a>—that film on its own almost created all of cult cinema programming. One movie can do that. It can create an audience that is replicated and becomes a whole industry. And that can happen again, but it needs those films to do that. They will come as things ebb and flow. The streamers will control the whole market and then one day someone will go “I don’t want to watch this stuff, I want to watch something else” and they’ll go make it.</p><p>It’s like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a1m\"><i>The Matrix</i></a>, it’s a repeating cycle. There’ll always be ‘the One’. There’s Barbara Loden in 1970 making <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2OjK\">Wanda</a>,</i> basically inventing American independent cinema. So I don’t worry massively about it. I know it’s awkward and awful for people to go bankrupt and the cinemas to close down, but in time they’ll re-open because people will wanna see stuff. The figures for cinemagoers were massive before Covid. Are you saying that people with money are not going to exploit that? Life will find a way. Remember that the cinema industry from the beginning is one that’s in a tailspin. Every year is a disaster and they’re going bust. But they survived the Spanish Flu, which is basically the same thing.</p><p><b>Two months ago, you quickly made a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/s652\">horror movie</a>. We’re going to get a lot of these from filmmakers who just need to create something this year. What can you identify now about this inevitable next wave of micro-budget, micro-schedule <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7p2i6\">pandemic-era</a> cinema?<br/></b>I’ve always made micro-budget films so that side of it is not so crazy. There will be a lot of Zoom and people-locked-in-houses films but they won’t be so interesting. They’re more to-keep-you-sane kind of filmmaking which is absolutely fine. Where you should look for [the ‘pandemic-era’ films] is from the kids and young adults through 14 to 25 who’ve been the most affected by it. They will be the ones making the true movies about the pandemic which will be in like five years’ time.</p><p>People going through GCSEs and A-Levels [final high-school exams in England] will have had their social contracts thoroughly smashed by the government after society tells them that this is the most important thing you’re ever gonna do in your life. Then the next day the government tells them “actually, you’ve all passed”, then the next day they go “no, you’ve all failed”, and then “oh no, you’ve all passed”. It’s totally bizarre. Anyone who’s in university at the moment [is] thinking about how they’ve worked really hard to get to that position and now they’ve had it taken away from them. That type of schism in that group will make for a unique set of storytelling impetus. Much more interesting than from my perspective of being a middle-age bloke and having to stay in my house for a bit, which was alright. Their experience is extreme and that will change cinema.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>It’s time to probe into your taste in film. Firstly, three questions about Alfred Hitchcock: his best film, most underrated film, and most overrated film?<br/></b>It’s tricky, there’s a lot to choose from. I think <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ab2\"><i>Psycho</i></a> is his best film because, much like <i>Wanda</i>, it was the invention of indie cinema. He took a TV crew to go and do a personal project and then completely redefined horror, and he did it in the same year as <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Utk\"><i>Peeping Tom</i></a>.</p><p>There’s stuff I really like in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/22zq\"><i>Torn Curtain</i></a>. Certainly the murder scene where they’re trying to stick the guy in the oven. It’s a gut-wrenching sequence. Overrated, I don’t know. It’s just a bit mean, isn’t it? Overrated by who? They’re all massively rated, aren’t they?</p><p><b>Which film made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b>The slightly uncool version of my answer is the first fifteen minutes of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29UU\"><i>Dr. No</i></a> before I got sent to bed. We used to watch movies on the telly when I was a kid, so movies would start at 7pm and I had to go to bed at 7:30pm. You would get to see the first half-hour and that would be it. The opening was really intriguing. I never actually saw a lot of these movies until I was much older.</p><p>The more grown-up answer is a film like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b8y\"><i>Taxi Driver</i></a>. It was the first time where I felt like I’d been transported in a way where there was an authorship to a film that I didn’t understand. It had done something to me that television and straightforward movies hadn’t done and made me feel very strange. It was something to do with the very, very intense mixture of sound, music and image and I started to understand that that was cinema.</p><p><b>What horror movie do you watch every Hallowe’en?<br/></b>I watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/294O\"><i>The Thing</i></a> every year but I don’t tend to celebrate Hallowe’en, to be honest. I’m of an age where it wasn’t a big deal and was never particularly celebrated. I find it a bit like “what’s all this Hallowe’en about?”—horror films for me are for all year-round.</p><p><b>What’s a brilliant mindfuck movie that perhaps even cinephiles haven’t seen?<br/></b>What grade of cinephile are we talking? All of the work by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jan-svankmajer/\">Jan Švankmajer</a>, maybe. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3Ido\"><i>Hard to Be a God</i></a> is pretty mindfucky if you want a bit of that, but cinephiles should know about it. It’s pretty intense. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1uSS\"><i>Marketa Lazarová</i></a> too.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><i>‘Marketa Lazarová’ (1967) directed by František Vláčil.</i></p><p><b>What is the greatest screen romance that you totally fell head over heels for?<br/></b>I guess it’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aG0\"><i>Casablanca</i></a> for me. That would be it.</p><p><b>Which coming-of-age film did you connect to the most as a teenager?<br/></b>[Pauses for effect] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/scum/\"><i>Scum</i></a>.</p><p><b>Who is an exciting newcomer director we should keep our eyes on?<br/></b>God, I don’t know. I would say <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jim-hosking/\">Jim Hosking</a> but he’s older than me and he’s not a newcomer because he’s done <a href=\"https://boxd.it/anX0\">two</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fUcw\">movies</a>. So, that’s rubbish. He doesn’t count.</p><p>[Editor’s note: Hosking contributed to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5QbE\"><i>ABCs of Death 2</i></a> with the segment “G is for Grandad” while Wheatley contributed to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/35HY\"><i>The ABCs of Death</i></a> with the segment “U is for Unearthed” and also executive produced the follow-up film.]</p><p><b>What was your best cinema experience?<br/></b>[Spoiler warning for <i>The Thing</i>.]</p><p>Oh, one that speaks in my mind is seeing <i>The Thing</i> at an all-nighter in the <a href=\"https://scala.co.uk/\">Scala</a> at King’s Cross, and I was sitting right next to this drunk guy who was talking along to the screen. It was a packed cinema with about 300 people, and someone at the front told him “will you just shut up?” The guy says “I won’t shut up. You tell me to shut up again and I’ll spoil the whole film!” The whole audience goes “no, no, no!” and he went “it’s the black guy and the guy with the beard—everyone else dies!” That made me laugh so much.</p><p><b>Do you have a favorite film you’ve watched so far this year?<br/></b>Yeah, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/217q\"><i>Zombie Flesh Eaters</i></a>.</p>"

To combat these monsters, a dazzling white mare goddess gives birth to three heroes—the protagonist, Fanyüvő (‘Treeshaker’), and his brothers—who embark on a journey to save the universe. In the telling, Jankovics is clearly only interested in the kind of imagery that, well, only animation can provide.</p><p><i>Son of the White Mare</i> (<i>Fehérlófia</i>) is one of four feature-length films by the animator—his others are <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/johnny-corncob/\"><i>Johnny Corncob</i></a> (<i>János Vitéz</i>, 1973), which was Hungary’s first feature-length animated film, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/3c9k\">Song of the Miraculous Hind</a></i> (2002) and the drama <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3SeQ\"><i>The Tragedy of Man</i></a> (2011), which took Jankovics almost three decades to complete. These features have found continuing acclaim in the animation industry and amongst cult enthusiasts. Jankovics’ shorts are just as celebrated: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sisyphus/\"><i>Sisyphus</i></a> (1974) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short at the 48th Academy Awards, and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3SfO\"><i>The Struggle</i></a> (1977) received a Palme d’Or for short film at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>Born in Budapest in 1941, Jankovics began his career almost casually; after realizing his family’s status meant no higher education would be available to him, he passed a test to work at <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/studio/pannonia-filmstudio-1/\">Pannónia Filmstúdió</a>. He has said that the animated Russian film <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2wJU\"><i>The Humpbacked Horse</i></a> (1947) directed by Ivan Ivanov-Vano was the first cartoon he remembers watching, but that art books inspired him more than films. His career has traversed post-war Hungary, including the end of the Communist regime in 1989, and Soviet military regime in 1991. These events led to greater storytelling freedom, a shift that can be spied in his art, which has included television documentaries, commercials, books, teaching, and <a href=\"https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/marcell-jankovics-interview-feherlofia-why-would-one-imitate-reality-112926.html\">a Disney paycheck</a> (for work that was never seen in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Tey\"><i>The Emperor’s New Groove</i></a>).</p><p>In our interview, Jankovics remains steadfast in his commitment to his “chosen path”, celebrating—but not being distracted by—others in his field, and revealing glimpses of his renowned sense of humor.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>This restoration and re-release marks the first time that your film has been distributed in America in decades. Have your views on <i>Son of the White Mare</i> shifted in the time since?<br/></b><i>Marcell Jankovics:</i> They have not changed.</p><p><b>A lot of <i>Son of the White Mare</i> unfolds on a flat, often circular plane. What inspired you to frame things this way?<br/></b>I never considered 3D. I don’t use it even today. The circularity is a part of what I have to say. A fairy tale (all fairy tales) traverses a particular arc, the year, of the eternal cycle.</p><p><b>Could you run me through the development of the style of <i>Son of the White Mare</i>?<br/></b>Use of the color wheel accompanied the above-mentioned circularity; this was partly adapted to the circle of time and partly to the characters. I wanted to get rid of contours. I could manage this because my characters are illuminated, this is why I could take advantage of light contours.</p><p><b>I notice that a number of your short films have focused on Greek mythology, while your features have mostly drawn from Hungarian folklore or influenced by Judeo-Christian religion. Did your interests shift?<br/></b>Absolutely not! All are projections of a similar spirit of the same world. I’m currently writing a book about Biblical symbolism, and in it I make numerous references to (Hungarian) folk tales.</p><p><b>What fascinates you about these myths and legends?<br/></b>They remain eternally true. They are harmonizations of the external cosmos and man’s inner, spiritual, unconscious world.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Looking at some of the sequences of <i>Fehérlófia</i>, I was reminded of the sequence where Susano’o battles the Fire God in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2Yrk\"><i>The Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon</i></a> (1963), directed by Yūgo Serikawa and Toei Dog. Is that a film you’re familiar with?<br/></b>No. And I don’t need to [be]. Tales and myths are universal, the differences are stylistic. Of course, I’d love to see it. When I designed the <i>Fehérlófia</i> figures, I drew countless Japanese woodcuts. I also used Japanese theatrical masks for my heroes’ facial expressions. It’s not common knowledge but the Hungarians and the Japanese consider themselves to be related.</p><p><b>I’ve read in an old interview that you don’t watch much new animation. Is that still true?<br/></b>Yes. I don’t want to be distracted from my chosen path.</p><p><b>What films, live-action or animated, would you say have made the greatest impression on you?<br/></b>I’d rather give you directors: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/sergei-eisenstein-1/\">Eisenstein</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/akira-kurosawa/\">Kurosawa</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/federico-fellini/\">Fellini</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/andrzej-wajda/\">A. Wajda</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ken-russell/\">Ken Russell</a>. In animation: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/frederic-back/\">Frédéric Back</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/richard-williams/\">Richard Williams</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/john-hubley/\">John Hubley</a>. I don’t know if they influenced me but I have the greatest respect for them and I always enjoy watching their films.</p><p><b>What’s the first film you would suggest to someone looking to discover more animation?<br/></b><a href=\"https://youtu.be/tYBlAon683s\">My own <i>Sisyphus</i></a>. It might be particularly shocking for anyone who has never seen animation before.</p><p><b>What was the film that made you fall in love with animation?<br/></b>It was a little different for me, I was rather forced into it as a career. It’s a long story and I’ve told it many times. As a young kid I only watched Soviet cartoons, but still I was enchanted because animation impressed with its own kind of genre surrealism. When I started working in the profession and I had the chance to see others as well, I realized that everything was possible in this world, even what I wanted to do.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Do you have a favorite myth, or one that you’ve been wanting to adapt?<br/></b>Not any more. At the age of 79, I yearn for less laborious work.</p><p><b>Are there any upcoming films you’re excited to see yourself?<br/></b>I haven’t been to the cinema for a very long time. The sort of films that I would be interested in are broadcast on TV late at night. I usually look forward to the latest season of the <i>Vikings</i> series.</p><p><b>How do you feel about the future of animation?<br/></b>The true arts are receiving less and less space in every genre. It is sufficient for me merely to mention the latest restrictive aspects of the Oscars. I hope that the marginalization of the arts and this kind of restriction prove to be only temporary.</p>"

Along with her religious conviction comes a belief that she has been chosen to save Amanda’s soul from damnation.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>The film is told from Maud’s point of view, which warps our ability to decipher whether her experiences are real, or the result of something more sinister. When I spoke to Glass earlier this year—a whole pandemic ago—about the inner workings of Maud’s mind, she delighted in the ambiguity at play, and pointed to a famous historical figure as inspiration.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>I loved <i>Saint Maud</i>. Where did the inspiration come from for this story<br/></b><i>Rose Glass: Saint Maud</i> is an amalgamation of weird stuff I had in my head for a long time. I’ve always been interested in the extreme divide between how we present ourselves to the rest of the world and how the rest of the world sees us. We see inside somebody’s head while having a strange relationship with reality and the people around you.</p><p>I read about people who hear voices and the different circumstances, and conditions that might lead to that and how it causes difficulty in other people’s lives. There are figures who claim to hear the voice of God thousands of years ago and were revered. However, in 2020, if someone says they hear the voice of God in their heads, I’m sure the public reaction will be different.</p><p><b>I did pick up on some Joan of Arc parallels in the film.<br/></b>I did definitive research about Joan of Arc, and what’s interesting is some modern-day psychologists believe that Joan might have had a particular type of epilepsy, that is accompanied by ecstatic seizures. These seizures are sometimes accompanied by [divine] hallucinations that are euphoric. It can make you feel like you’re touching or hearing from God.</p><p><b>I went back and forth on whether this film wants to explore mental illness or demonic possession—it could be a bit of both, right?<br/></b>I wrote an ambiguous story on purpose so the audience could choose to take the whole thing as a bout of psychosis, or whether you think she’s actually talking to God. I never thought about the idea of possession and it’s a truly interesting take.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Maud is ambiguous too: is she a protagonist, an antagonist, or antihero? That’s what makes the character alluring.<br/></b>Her mind is a source of horror and because she’s an unreliable narrator, the audience just won’t know what to believe. I hope that it’s an exciting film that gets under people’s skins and stays with them. I also hope they feel some compassion for Maud. This film is all about getting people to put themselves in the shoes of someone who is experiencing reality in a radically different way.</p><p><b>When did Morfydd Clark and Jennifer Ehle get involved in the project?<br/></b>We started doing auditions before the film was green-lit. The success of the film hinged on finding the right actress for Maud. We auditioned a lot of women, and were worried we wouldn’t find the right person. Morfydd was the last to audition and she got the part. She’s talented, has massive range, and fantastic comedic timing.</p><p>With Jennifer, we offered her the role and she said yes. I’m grateful to her because she’s an established actress and here is this weird little English film from an unknown director and she still wanted to be a part of it.</p><p><b>When developing the film, what was your process for deciding how <i>Saint Maud</i> would flow on screen? And how did the cinematography, set and sound design add to that narrative?<br/></b>Before I started writing the script, I wanted the whole thing to be incredibly subjective and told through Maud’s [eyes]. I could’ve gone with a melodrama about this young woman struggling with reality, but I wanted it to feel grand and cinematic because she’s going on a spiritual journey. I spent a lot of time with the crew and I wanted everyone to be expressive and bold in how this turned out. And that’s what we got.</p><p><b>Do you think those elements you describe help land <i>Saint Maud</i> in the horror genre, as opposed to a psychological thriller?<br/></b>When I wrote it, horror wasn’t something I had in mind, but it definitely ended up being more of one when I talked to the producers. They told me the script reads like a horror film. It’s always been this twisted, dark, story, but the conventional horror beats happened later.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>You filmed in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. What was the behind the choice to set <i>Saint Maud</i> in this particular coastal town?<br/></b>We wanted the setting to be an English seaside town. They have a feel that’s timeless and slightly otherworldly. I wanted the illusion of a place that appears like an alternate version of reality. We went gothic and intimidating with a mysterious house on the hill overlooking the water to have some elemental imagery to play with.</p><p><b>What was the first horror film you remember watching?<br/></b>I’m not a horror nerd but the first horror film I remember seeing is <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29gg\">Gremlins</a></i>. I was at a sleepover at a friend’s house, and we watched <i>Gremlins</i>. They were all laughing and loving it and I was absolutely terrified.</p><p><b>You’ve mentioned that you like to watch “messed-up” films. Which one is your favorite?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/24DE\">Visitor Q</a></i>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2886\"><i>The</i> <i>Piano Teacher</i></a> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29uC\">Videodrome</a></i>. I think watching anything that you feel like you shouldn’t be is always fun.</p><p><b>What was the first film that made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-lord-of-the-rings-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>The</i> <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy</a>. It’s the first time I was interested in knowing how films were made. I obsessively started to, like, track down interviews with the filmmakers and watch behind-the-scenes stuff. That was the film that sort of made me realize how much can go into creating.</p><p><b>What living filmmaker do you admire the most?<br/></b>David Cronenberg, John Waters and Martin Scorsese were some of my favorites growing up.</p><p><b>In the midst of this global pandemic, are there any go-to movies that are your comfort films?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/27Xs\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a></i>, which I’ve watched for the millionth time. I also watched a film called <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/iMbG\">Border</a></i>, and it’s one of the best things I’ve seen in ages. I also really liked a psychological thriller called <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/mUm6\">The Platform</a></i>. Those are my go-to films right now.</p>"

I ran into a list that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/holliehorror/\">Hollie Horror</a> had made and wound up starting a profile and it went from there. That would have been a little over seven years ago.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>How freakin’ cool is last year’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/letterboxd/status/1194831265716822017?lang=en\">Hallowe’en Easter egg</a> with the dripping blood from our logo? [Pro members get this added to their pages by mentioning #horror in their bio.]<br/></b>I’m a fan.</p><p><b>Unfortunately I haven’t heard of a single one of your four profile favorites! What’s urging you to highlight these films?<br/></b>They are just lesser-seen and have something good or great about them. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/11HQ\"><i>Eyeball</i></a> is a great little underseen <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/umberto-lenzi/\">Umberto Lenzi</a> film. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/181W\"><i>Death Machines</i></a> is an awkward, weird and wonderful film with kung fu and blood. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Ksm\"><i>Massacre at Central High</i></a> is one of my favorite films and sadly lacking a disc release of any kind—anyone who has seen <i>Heathers</i> will recognize a couple of things if they watch it. <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2eQ4\">Rituals</a></i> is a criminally underseen stalked in the woods film from the ’70s.</p><p><b>In this <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dQWe\">this list description</a>, you explain how the original <a href=\"https://boxd.it/38kSl\"><i>Frankenstein</i></a> (1931) hooked you into horror at four years old. Can you describe what you most remember about that life-changing experience?<br/></b>It was both magical and terrifying. The space, the creature, the little girl. I had trouble sleeping for weeks afterwards. No matter where I am in the world, if there is a screening of Frank, I’ll go. I watched most of the major universals by the time I was six or seven. I saw <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2awY\"><i>Alien</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a54\"><i>Jaws 2</i></a> with my folks and those stuck with me. Cable and a local UHF station showing Hammer films on Saturdays are what really allowed me to get sucked in.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>The horror films of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/79Ic\">1980</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/755U\">1981</a> were the most impactful and are the ones that mean the most to me to this day; <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/12Dq\">Fade to Black</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/v14\">Night School</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1khs\">Motel Hell</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Cc\">The Fog</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1fkm\">Alligator</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TBi\">Altered States</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/10uQ\">Terror Train</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1iuO\">Death Ship</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YqE\">Scanners</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29yk\">An American Werewolf in London</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Uce\">The Howling</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1PUK\">The Funhouse</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1xYa\">Dead &amp; Buried</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1pJc\">Hell Night</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1VxM\">Wolfen</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1xiS\">Ghost Story</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/LGM\">The Pit</a></i> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/132A\"><i>Evilspeak</i></a>. I saw all of them five to ten-plus times on cable as a kid. They’re still all high on my list. I am glad that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/12Dq\"><i>Fade to Black</i></a> is on Shudder. People need to watch it. More relevant now than then.</p><p><b>What exactly provoked you to start <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gcAe\">Hooptober</a> seven years ago?<br/></b>I moved into an old spooky house and had a backlog of Blu-rays to watch and the 4K of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lcS\"><i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i></a> was about to come out. I’d done some interactive stuff on Letterboxd previously and had a decent amount of people involved. I was also at a point in my life where 31 films in 31 days is tough, as it is for a lot of us now. So I thought ‘Why don’t I do something that starts a little early, clears some of my list out, and has some parameters that don’t feel like I am handing out an assignment?’ I grew up in Texas, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/tobe-hooper/\">Tobe</a> [Hooper] is close to my heart, and with all the Hooper I owned and the 4K coming out, I decided to christen it with his name. You can’t spell October without Tobe.</p><p><b>What’s the most members that have participated in a Hooptober?<br/></b>The number of people who participated was a little more than I expected, but that wasn’t what I was surprised by. I never thought of it as a recurring event until I started to hear from people the following summer about ‘the next one’. I just kinda chuckled after about a dozen people had asked and I said out loud to no one, “I guess I’m doing another one of these”. We are well over 700 this year, and still climbing.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>Where do you get the ideas for the rules for films to consider watching?<br/></b>At this point, I look back at past years so that I don’t repeat myself. I look to the current year for inspiration. Is there a film from a sub-genre that was prominent? Was it a strong year for output from women, Mexico, Asia, Black filmmakers, something cultural, and so on? I may focus on effects creators, an actor or writer on a whim. I try to keep an eye out for blind spots I haven’t covered. Shudder, <a href=\"http://archive.org\">archive.org</a>, the big streamers are all resources. Sadly, rarefilmm no longer exists.</p><p><b>In last year’s interview with<a href=\"https://merrygoroundmagazine.com/interview-cinemonster/\"> <i>Merry-Go-Round</i> magazine</a>, you mentioned plans to turn Hooptober into a film festival. How’s that going? In a post-pandemic world, how can we keep independent niche film festivals thriving?<br/></b>The world has not been agreeable, obviously. I’m not even sure how viable something like that will be next year. I’ve been taking a look at streaming options. Post-pandemic will require more creativity and outside-the-box thinking, and will probably continue to feed some drive-ins. Been a while since more than a handful of people wanted to put money into a drive-in, which is nice to see.</p><p>I’m going to do a tweet along to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/v2w\"><i>The Witch Who Came From the Sea</i></a> in October, and I’ll give you an exclusive here: <a href=\"https://www.georgearomerofoundation.org/\"><i>The George Romero Foundation</i></a> and I are doing online Horror Trivia on October 11. I had been doing it live with them here in Pittsburgh until the pandemic.</p><p><b>Based on this year’s rules and conditions, if there was one essential you-can’t-miss film you could force all your participants to add to their challenge, which film would it be?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1OTQ\"><i>Demons</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/QdU\"><i>Eve’s Bayou</i></a> or <i>The Witch Who Came From the Sea</i>.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>What have been your own greatest film discoveries through your Hooptober adventures?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/248m\"><i>A Tale of Two Sisters</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1s5a\"><i>I Drink Your Blood</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/c2C\"><i>Blood Diner</i></a>, and though it is a bit of a cheat to list this one, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kxqK\"><i>The Amusement Park</i></a>. It’s cheating because it didn’t exist as something that I or anyone else could have watched, prior to when I saw it.</p><p><b>Do you have any acclaimed horror movies still lingering in your <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1pScq\">list of shame</a>?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1j9i\"><i>Eyes Without a Face</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/i4gW\"><i>Upgrade</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1blA\"><i>Cure</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/Zmc\"><i>Scream 4</i></a>.</p><p><b>Have you ever completed one of your own Hooptober challenges yet?<br/></b>Errrrrrrrrr, one.

There have been a few others over the years. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/scrumblebunny/\">Slappy McGee</a> has helped me with Hooptober the last two years. They are great. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/javicueto/\">Javo</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/1mouth2ears/\">David Lawrence</a> are pretty great, too.</p><p><b>Before Hooptober, many <a href=\"https://boxd.it/eVqO\">of</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/d4nA\">your</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fM00\">lists</a> invited discussion with your followers. In what ways is Letterboxd the ideal forum to foster a community of film fans?<br/></b>Fans exercise their fandom in so many ways. The platform is so flexible that it allows you to utilize it in a small and personal way, in a promotional way, or to dive into the community pool and see who’s out there that shares something with you or can show you something. The more people that we are exposed to and listen to, we are all the better for.</p><p><b>Which of your review—from any genre—are you proudest of?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/38Q5b\">The Invisible Man</a> or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/32jcr\">The Hustler</a>, probably. I have a capsule of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2Fp93\">Hud</a> that I like.</p><p><b>So, you’re the horror guy. Nobody is denying that. You are Cinemonster, after all. But when I look at your<a href=\"https://boxd.it/7PT2\"> top movies list</a> and see that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/singin-in-the-rain/\"><i>Singin’ in the Rain</i></a> is your all-time number one, I’ll need you to explain yourself.<br/></b>I go back and forth between that and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Vy\"><i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i></a>.

I’ve taken a break the last few months, but I’ll probably knock out five or six more. With the exception of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28LC\"><i>25th Hour</i></a>, everything is a revisit. It’s been a joy to go back through everything. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1efg\"><i>Crooklyn</i></a> is much stronger than I remembered, and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1xfa\"><i>Bamboozled</i></a> just gets better and more impactful as time passes. I have loved Spike since the day I saw <a href=\"https://boxd.it/19Vw\"><i>School Daze</i></a>. His films have always connected with things that are important to me and to those that have been around me. Lee is still grossly under-appreciated as a narrative film director and a documentarian.</p><p><b>We’re bowing down to your epic <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7JJ6\">Blu-ray</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/86Ye\">DVD</a> collection.

She is the daughter of Theresa (Winger) and Robert (Jenkins), who have raised her with the thrill of a heist in her heart. The family dynamic is all business; the unit functions as a mob crew, forever planning the next con. This gives Old Dolio a laser focus on the job, and a painfully obvious lack of tenderness in her life. It’s when the family meets Melanie (Rodriguez) during an ambitious con that Old Dolio’s world cracks open. While her parents see Melanie—all heat and curves—as an asset to their schemes, Old Dolio—lank hair and shapeless clothes—feels something else, something she doesn’t yet recognize.</p><p>Those familiar with Wood’s work elsewhere might be taken aback. Old Dolio is immediately and consistently unpredictable, with a chilly lack of emotion that comes from simply not knowing where to find it. She has clearly been raised in an environment that prioritizes hustle over love, and this converges in Wood’s voice: a low, monotone register that’s never questioned on screen, and which somehow feels entirely normal for July’s uncanny world, but surely hides something potent to be explored.</p><p>“I would have never asked an actor to do that,” July says of Wood’s register-change. “It seems a bit too much, and really risky.” That’s surprising: July’s films, with their brazen singularity and offbeat humor, could be the sort that would savor such a vocal transformation as a playful quirk. It’s refreshing and illuminating to hear how, actually, it was a perfect coincidence. “When we were rehearsing, Evan said that her original register was that much lower, but she used to get vocal nodules and so trained her voice higher, which is the one people know now,” July explains. “But she said she was just as comfortable being lower, so I asked if she could stay there for the whole film. I noticed right away when she dropped down, she dropped into character.”</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Although July will never reveal all her secrets, nothing happens by chance. Old Dolio’s voice exemplifies <i>Kajillionaire</i>’s careful understanding of fluid, curious sexuality that survives and thrives in the spaces where people are just figuring things out. It’s not about seducing, but learning and adapting. “Voices, like hair, are things that we play with at different times in our life,” says July. “Certainly in queer culture, it wouldn’t be unheard of for someone to deepen their voice, consciously or with hormones. I like that it’s a little surprising. What is natural is pretty up for grabs.”</p><p>Debra Winger, too, is unrecognizably compelling. As entertaining as <i>Kajillionaire</i>’s characters are, there’s a faint air of menace about Theresa and Robert, as they always and only have one thing on their minds. “The actors took flight,” July explains. “They did so much I couldn’t have expected, and for someone like me who is so used to doing things all alone, that feels like gold.”</p><p>Comedy breathes through both July’s whip-smart script and her actors’ precision-engineered physicality. Theresa, Robert and Old Dolio tense up in the same way to process their fear of flying, they limbo along a very specific part of a street to avoid making eye contact with their landlord. “I don’t know how to do a tuck-and-roll, I can’t do the limbo like Evan can!” July laughs. “There were things I had come up with that were almost abstract, but she could do everything and take it really far.”</p><p>The relationship between Old Dolio and Melanie is just as disorienting as the one between Old Dolio and her parents, and between her parents and Melanie. Old Dolio attends parenting classes to better understand the ways her parents behave; Melanie offers to fill that gap for a very specific sum of money; Theresa and Robert search for ways to understand pleasure, to feel that they, as individual people, matter in a world lived on the outskirts of ‘normal’.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>It’s why Bobby Vinton’s 1962 heartbreaker ‘Mr. Lonely’ feels like a perfect hymn for these odd souls to explore what they’re missing. The familiar theme returns throughout the film, and there’s now <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WR60i9EqeUA\">a cover of the track by Angel Olsen</a> on an ‘inspired by’ record. Olsen adds a sense of guttural melancholy that still has bite. The cover was the idea of <i>Kajillionaire</i> composer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/emile-mosseri/\">Emile Mosseri</a> (who changed the game with his work on <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iWAw\"><i>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</i></a>).</p><p>“Not many people can sing like that,” July says. “We were sending each other some of her songs while shooting anyway, just as inspiration. It’s very modern when sung by a woman, and of course in the film Old Dolio is Mr. Lonely—but you don’t get the gender twist of it when it’s sung by Bobby Vinton.”</p><p>Mosseri’s own ethereal score—an orchestral, very old-Hollywood waltzing theme—makes so much of the film feel like a projection of make-believe, dotted with images that could only be plucked from our unconscious. But, July says: “None of these images literally come from dreams.” (Although she admitted earlier this year that the name Old Dolio came from a friend’s dream about a list of cat names).</p><p>Still, detailing the poetry behind a key ethereal image, the filmmaker’s curiosity and sensitivity is undeniable. “There is something very sexy to me about those pink nails coming off,” she says of a scene in which Old Dolio carefully peels off Melanie’s acrylics one by one, as a swirling soundtrack fills the air and the light in a grubby diner turns golden. “I was always trying to find ways that Old Dolio could be in a little over her head and accidentally show her cards, even though she might be fighting against her feelings about Melanie. I guess those nails would seem entirely foreign to her, so she would approach them in this animal way.”</p><p>We feel compelled to ask July about another unshakeable image: the glittering suds that Old Dolio and her parents face every day in the rented office space they call home, oozing through the walls from the business next door. Does it make sense? Will it ever be fixed? Can you love something so destructive?</p><p>“I was trying to figure out why the rent would be cheap enough for them to afford that place,” July says, matter of fact. “There would have to be something really wrong with it. But then I thought, why not make it beautiful also?” And it’s as simple as that. Something inherently wrong, inexplicable, still so luxurious it stays lodged in your brain. Such is the slippery, effervescent brilliance of Miranda July and <i>Kajillionaire</i>.</p>"

People are just people, love is just love, and that’s what wins me over.”</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>“Definitely a very 2020 film,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jovi/film/the-broken-hearts-gallery/\">writes Jovi</a>. “It couldn’t have been written in the same way even ten years ago. It captures being in your twenties in the modern day perfectly.” “Bloody loved the female empowerment and the unconventional narrative and characters,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/meghillbilly/film/the-broken-hearts-gallery/\">enthuses Meg</a>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>Reading through the reviews, the most common reaction is praise for how unapologetically inclusive the film is, in a way that feels appallingly novel for a mainstream film. As Krinsky explains it, “I wanted to make a film that was reflective of the world that I see around me and the world that these characters would inhabit if they lived amongst us mortals.” Or, as Montgomery casually states, “I think it’s where we’re at in 2020 with casting and stuff.” The ease with which the film does this indicts most of modern cinema for its lack of representation.</p><p>Krinsky’s inclusive casting and characterization decisions stretch across the entire cast, encompassing that essential feature of modern rom-coms: the quirky ‘best friend’. As well as lending authenticity and personality to the leading characters’ lives, the bestie is often where the ‘com’ in rom-com comes in. <i>The Broken Hearts Gallery</i> has an abundance of quirksters, from Lucy’s roommates (who include <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kmvE\"><i>Hamilton</i></a>’s Phillipa Soo as saucy, serial heartbreaker Nadine) to Nick’s straight-talking BFF Marcos (a very funny Arturo Castro).</p><p>But the chemistry between the central couple is <i>everything</i> in romantic comedies, and <i>The Broken Hearts Gallery</i> benefits greatly from its fresh-faced, emerging-star leads, both of whom are Australian. “We had a rapport with each other much faster maybe than usual,” Montgomery says of his and Viswanathan’s shared background. “I haven&rsquo;t worked with an Australian actor or actress overseas so that was really nice. She’s a wildly talented, comedic actress. It was my first foray into this sort of genre. I was sort of shit-scared and she’s really held my hand through it.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Krinksy, likewise, was blown away by Viswanathan’s talents, having seen her work in <i>Blockers</i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hala-2019/\"><i>Hala</i></a>.<i> “</i>She does this great physical comedy in <i>Blockers</i>, and then in <i>Hala</i>, she plays this really vulnerable, dramatic teenage role. I was so taken by her ability to pull both of those completely different parts off. I just immediately had this feeling, which I hadn’t ever had before, of: ‘this is Lucy’. She’s got this comedic timing that is very much like Lucille Ball, it’s got this effervescence to it. She’s able to do so much without saying a word. And then she opens her mouth and it’s a gift.”</p><p>It’s no small thing for Viswanathan to have been cast as Lucy. Many an actor’s career has been made by a leading role in a romantic comedy, and—current industry upheaval notwithstanding—Viswanathan looks set to break out even further with her performance here. Montgomery’s and Krinsky’s enthusiasm for her work echoes a central theme in <i>The Broken Hearts Gallery</i>: when Montgomery first met with writer-director Krinsky about the film, she told him the story was somewhat inspired by the idea of seeing men support women in their careers, as Nick does with Lucy. “That was a big thing for me,” he explains, “because I have a lot of really strong women in my life that have supported me—my partner, my mum, my grandmother, so on and so forth.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Those who know Montgomery from <i>Stranger Things</i> will be interested to learn why he pivoted to romantic comedy. He tells us he was looking for something diametrically opposed to his break-out performance in that show<i>. “</i>As a viewer, I love comedy. As an actor, can’t think of anything scarier. I function in this realm of ‘plan, prepare, do everything the way I know’. The great thing about this was it was ever-evolving. It really did force me to come out of my comfort zone.” (Montgomery will pivot again for his <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/baz-luhrmann-elvis-presley-richard-roxburgh-1234772642\">next role</a>, which he says is “kind of a dream role. I can’t speak about it now… Again, it’s 180 degrees in the other direction, so it is a wild ride.”)</p><p>Krinsky is also switching things up, career-wise. <i>The Broken Hearts Gallery</i> is her first feature film, after cutting her teeth in television writers’ rooms (<i>Gossip Girl, Grey’s Anatomy, 90210</i>). She credits that environment for training her to fix storytelling problems on the fly. A story a decade in the making, <i>Broken Hearts</i> came from her own romantic aspirations and fears. “I had had many conversations like [the one Lucy has early in the film with Max (Utkarsh Ambudkar), where he dumps her after telling her she’s ‘a blast’]. So that certainly came from my life. I’d been fired from my job. I was moving apartments and I was going through the detritus of these past relationships and kind of trying to figure out what I was going to keep and what I was going to hold on to. You kind of pepper in those things [that are] reflective of relationships in your twenties.”</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Going into the film, Krinsky was very conscious of trying to set it apart from rom-coms that have come before. “Making a good romantic comedy is actually quite difficult because it’s so well-trodden, and because there are beats that we want. We want to cheer for two people falling in love. Because of that, my philosophy going into this was very much centered around Lucy. We’ve seen a lot of romantic comedies in the past where we see a woman trying to fit herself into a mold in order to be with someone and ultimately realizing, ‘Oh, that mold isn’t who I am’. Lucy is a character who certainly has her foibles and has her anxieties and has her eccentricities, but she consistently asks the world to love her <i>because</i> she is weird, not <i>despite</i> the fact that she is weird. That messaging was really important to me.”</p><p>In another case of the film gently nudging the rom-com genre forward, it acknowledges how ridiculous grand romantic gestures can be, but still manages to include a few. Krinsky believes there is room for grand gestures in real life. “I certainly hope so. I would like a grand gesture every once in a while—wouldn’t we all? We deserve it. I’m a little bit hopelessly romantic in that way. And I will say I like the surprise. To be able to just, show up home and say, ‘I was walking around today and I saw this cactus. And I thought of you. And here it is.’ Maybe that’s not so grand, but it’s the gesture at least.”</p><p>We note that another unique aspect of <i>The Broken Hearts Gallery</i> is the feeling that it doesn’t seem like it’s going to live or die on whether or not the two main characters end up together. “I think they both needed to confront a little bit of who they were,” Krinksy agrees. “Which I always think is the truth about really falling in love, is that in order to have a good relationship, you need to have a good one with yourself first.”</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>Clearly a huge fan of the genre, we ask Krinsky to recommend her favorites from the canon. “I love some of our recent classics. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/when-harry-met-sally/\">When Harry Met Sally</a></i> is a perfect romantic comedy. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bridget-joness-diary/\">Bridget Jones’s Diary</a></i> is a perfect romantic comedy. I love <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/clueless/\">Clueless</a>—</i>even though it’s more com than rom. And then I really love some of the older ones. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/broadcast-news/\">Broadcast News</a></i> is one of my all time favorites. Going back even further two of my go-tos that hold up today are <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/his-girl-friday/\">His Girl Friday</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/it-happened-one-night/\">It Happened One Night</a></i>. Those two, especially if you’re talking about the ‘strong female lead’, they held them in spades and that fast quippy dialogue I just really live for.”</p><p>Montgomery, meanwhile, turns out to be somewhat of a cinephile, something he cultivated as a teenager in the Australian suburbs. “I worked at McDonald’s and I spent all my money on going to [electronics and DVD store] JB Hi-Fi. That’s my childhood in a nutshell. Growing up, I was either at the cinema or in my room and spending all my money on DVDs. All my friends worked at video stores. That was kind of my jam.”</p><p>And then—mic drop—Montgomery casually shares the news that he has a secret Letterboxd account. Yes, dear reader, it appears that Dacre is a full-on ’boxd-head. “Oh yeah. I mean, that’s why I was so happy that this [interview] was coordinated. Other than obviously having a chance to talk to you just in general to chat about the platform, it’s a combination of a couple of things that I’m going to put quickly in a couple of words: obviously you can create watchlists on Disney+, Netflix and so on. But then you’ve got so many bloody platforms, all of your lists are in different spaces and all of your movies are spread out on different platforms.</p><p>“For me, the biggest role for [Letterboxd] is I can formulate everything in one place, on one platform and look at it. It’s just got so … much … stuff. If I’m up for a horror movie, but I want it set in the snow, I can log on there and it’s, like, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-thing/\">The Thing</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hold-the-dark/\">Hold The Dark</a></i>. All these great movies. Which I love. And I can read reviews of them before or after.”</p><p>Montgomery’s partner is also on Letterboxd, as is his childhood best friend. “Every time we leave the cinema, he gets on Letterboxd and writes a review—his honest, immediate reaction to what he’s just seen. It’s the first thing he does. It’s a great outlet for him. He’s had filmmakers reach out to him, which is another lovely thing. I think a lot of the arts and creative community is actually active on that platform. My buddy just spent <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pro/\">the $20 for the year thing</a> and now he can see what his top actors are that he watches, what’s his most-watched decade. I love that sort of stuff. I’m such a cinephile, to be able to collate everything into one sort of succinct thing—that’s my dream.”</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p>Naturally, we ask Montgomery to represent his home country and name-check some Aussie films and filmmakers. “Obviously I’m still quite young, but a lot of cinema like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/felony-2013/\">Felony</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-rover/\">The Rover</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/animal-kingdom/\">Animal Kingdom</a></i>, that whole sort of genre, like all the David Michôd films. That sort of realm, I loved growing up. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/baz-luhrmann/\">Baz Luhrmann</a>’s films, obviously. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/donald-mcalpine/\">Don McAlpine</a>, Australian cinematographer. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/bruce-beresford-1/\">Bruce Beresford</a>. There’s such an amazing pedigree of actors as well, most recently, obviously the Edgertons [<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/joel-edgerton/\">Joel</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/nash-edgerton/\">Nash</a>], <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/ben-mendelsohn/\">Ben Mendelsohn</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/heath-ledger/\">Heath</a>, obviously, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/naomi-watts/\">Naomi Watts</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/nicole-kidman/\">Nicole Kidman</a>.”</p><p>Curious to learn more about why a bona-fide star would lurk on Letterboxd where his own performances are ranked, rated and reviewed, we ask Montgomery: what does he get out of it? “I don&rsquo;t have this in-built bias or expectation, even though you’d think I would to kind of go, ‘<i>Why</i> didn’t they like that?’ I love reading the bad reviews. I’m all about it. I’m just interested to see what they engaged with. I think that’s the great thing about Letterboxd as opposed to any other platform is that I can just kind of log in under my alias and read everyone’s uninhibited dialogue that’s come out just after they’ve seen the film. And I love that. Good, bad, ugly. The whole lot. I think it’s the coolest thing ever.”</p><p> So then, the final, obvious question: has he been reading the <i>Broken Hearts</i> reviews? “I love to look up the <i>Broken Hearts Gallery</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-broken-hearts-gallery/\">page</a>. I think people are just enjoying this level of escapism. If they had the ability to go to a drive-in or to the cinema, wherever they are, people are just kind of going ‘it was so nice to get out of my house and out of my head’. It’s what any cinema tries to do, that level of escapism. I think it couldn’t have come at a better time. Once it’s done its cinematic release, it’ll be on streamers and then people can have that level of escapism who weren’t able to go to the cinema, so that’s really nice.”</p><p>Prepare yourself for <i>The Broken Hearts Gallery</i> by checking out this <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/drucilla/list/a-comprehensive-guide-to-romantic-comedies/\">extremely thorough Letterboxd list of romantic comedies</a>, expand your romantic comedy horizons with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/_roxannepena/list/south-korean-romantic-comedy-rom-com/\">this list of South Korean rom-coms</a>, and get a feel for where Letterboxd members are at, rom-com-wise, with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/love-serenade/\">this romantic comedy showdown.</a></p>"

His parents are the LA Rebellion filmmakers <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/haile-gerima-2/\">Haile Gerima</a>, whose work includes the Golden Bear-nominated 1983 slavery drama <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2dw8\">Sankofa</a>,</i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/shirikiana-aina/\">Shirikiana Aina</a>, who documented changes to their DC neighborhood in her 1982 non-fiction short <a href=\"https://boxd.it/eSlk\"><i>Brick by Brick</i></a>.</p><p><i>Residue</i> was a family affair; the Gerima name is all through the credits. “My aunts were the chefs; my sister, she was, like, the head of the catering.” Although his legendary father managed to get off lightly with Costco runs, Gerima’s equally impressive mother ended up anchoring two of the film’s most affecting scenes, as Tonya, the Mom of Jay’s childhood friend, Mike (Derron “Rizzo” Scott).</p><p>“I had somebody else cast—she was a no-show. My mother was on set that day, just kind of helping feed people. I knew that she had what we needed, emotionally speaking. She was actually trying to drive away to go find the woman; I was like, ‘Nah, I need you right now’. She did it, but at a great cost.” The thing about filming in your own neighborhood, Gerima explains, where you’ve raised not only your own but also everyone else’s kids, with varying outcomes, is you end up bringing that lived experience to your scenes. “It’s very real for her. She’s not acting. I almost cried once we finished filming. Nobody spoke for a long time.”</p><p>The scene taught Gerima much about a director’s duty of care—particularly when he dared to ask his mother for a second take of a pivotal scene that takes place in a downpour. “In preparing to shoot in the rain we made a few mistakes, with the camera, the placement, there was miscommunication with me and the DP [Mark Jeevaratnam]. I, he, we both agreed that we needed another take. When I asked my mother for another take, she just looked at us like, it hurt, it was painful to ask. She did what she could, but you could tell that she didn’t have it in her.” As it turns out, the first take was the one. “I thought we ruined everything, but once I slowed down, I just saw what a miracle it was.”</p><p>It’s impossible to separate <i>Residue</i> from its limited budget and circumstances. Structurally rich and technically unusual, the film is a triumph of local knowledge, happy accidents, and “hood auditions”, where people were pulled straight off the street into the cast. It’s infused with an all-hands-on-deck spirit, constructed scene-by-scene during a home edit by Gerima himself.</p><p>“We shot the first draft of the script. You know what I mean? We didn’t have time to wait for a rewrite. We didn’t have time to wait for money. We didn’t have time to wait for anything. In many ways, it was the source of many of our problems, but it was also the source of a lot of our freedom, because we weren’t tied down by money. We weren’t tied down by a locked-in script.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>At Slamdance this past January, <i>Residue</i> won the audience award, and an acting prize for its star, Obinna Nwachukwu, whose story is a lesson for other aspiring actors. He was right for the role (“He fit the bill in terms of, he knows DC lingo, he knows the culture, he’s from the area, which was incredibly important”). More importantly, he was available. “The fact that we didn’t have resources, we needed somebody like him. He wants to act. He designs his life in his way where he was able to give us two weeks without knowing much about us. Once we got him, everything else became a lot easier.”</p><p>After Slamdance, of course, 2020 took a bit of a turn. <i>Residue</i> was shortlisted for Cannes, but that was cancelled and in May <a href=\"https://cinema.usc.edu/news/article.cfm?id=55047\">Gerima told his college paper</a>: “I think that the festival prospects for the rest of this year are getting dimmer by the day.” When we speak, however, he is in Venice, where his debut feature has just screened in the independent Venice Days section of La Biennale di Venezia. It turns out that Cannes Directors’ Fortnight head Paolo Moretti had put in a word with Venice Days. As 2020 goes, this is as good as it gets for new filmmakers—and is a beautiful demonstration of how the global festival community has pulled together to make something good out of the mess we’re in.</p><p>Likewise, Gerima is grateful to Ava DuVernay’s ARRAY Releasing, who made the Netflix deal. He notes that a Black-led distribution company is a luxury his parents never knew. “I think if Ava did not exist, our film probably would not have distribution. The broad imagination necessary to see the commercial potential of Black films is still not there. I’m often sad thinking about the fact that my parents had no such opportunity.” Like a scene straight out of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/je6E\"><i>Dolemite is My Name</i></a>, Gerima describes how his folks would book their own theaters across the US and use the African diaspora to help fill them, “proving the commercial nature of these films, in communities that hungered for real Black stories”.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Gerima’s film appetite is wide, and he’s often looked outside the US for inspiration. Some of the most crucial films in his development as a director have been the 1968 post-revolutionary Cuban films <a href=\"https://boxd.it/38mk\"><i>Lucia</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/Kos\"><i>Memories of Underdevelopment</i></a>. He is also a fan of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1k2s\"><i>La Lengua de las Mariposas</i></a> (‘Butterfly’, 1999, José Luis Cuerda), which has “one of my favorite endings in film, period”. Japanese influences include Akiro Kurosawa’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2axi\"><i>Seven Samurai</i></a> (1954) and Kaneto Shindo’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2520\"><i>The Naked Island</i></a> (1960) and he also looks to Chilean legend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/miguel-littin-1/\">Miguel Littin</a> and Soviet directors <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/andrei-tarkovsky/\">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/sergei-eisenstein-1/\">Sergei Eisenstein</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/CPq\">Nikita Mikhalkov</a>. His go-to comfort film? “<a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b1i\"><i>Akira</i></a>. I don’t know if it’s comfort, but I watch it all the time! I just think it’s one of the best films ever made.”</p><p>On the home front, an “incredible, important” American film is Ivan Dixon’s 1973 action drama <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bxY\"><i>The Spook Who Sat by the Door</i></a>, while the movies that “really put me onto talking to girls” are Gina Prince-Bythewood’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Nu6\"><i>Love &amp; Basketball</i></a> and Rick Famuyiwa’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1KHm\"><i>The Wood</i></a>. “These are the types of films, circulating within the Black community [that] we memorize the lines to. That set the sexual compass of Black adolescents, you know what I mean?”</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>His parents, however, remain Gerima’s greatest influence. “<i>Sankofa</i> was made without arbitration. Black stories that have no minders like that, nobody to answer to, often are far and away, the most honest types of Black storytelling that we see in film.” For other storytellers yet to take the first step, he offers this: “My best lesson from this film has been to always and at all times green-light my own self, my own actions, because that’s the only thing that I can control—and to not wait for conditions to be right or perfect.”</p><p>Acknowledging the privilege of being born into a filmmaking family, Gerima adds: “That may not apply to everybody. There are many, incredible things which prohibit action at times. But I think that there are many incredible conditions under which people can take action with the camera. I think that it’s really just a matter of how urgently that story burns within you. I can only say for myself, that’s the way the film got made. Without that, it would have been literally impossible.”</p><p>When asked who we should watch next, Gerima recommends <a href=\"https://boxd.it/rfDg\"><i>200 Meters</i></a>, written and directed by Palestinian filmmaker Ameen Nayfeh. (“He’s an incredibly poised and principled filmmaker.”) The film won the audience award at Venice Days. He also recommends <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oMBm\"><i>Really Love</i></a> by Angel Kristi Williams, which won a SXSW Special Jury Recognition for acting, and will feature as a Special Presentation at AFI Fest next month.</p>"

Without sacrificing the horrific authenticity of the experience, it was captivating, commercial television, but most crucially, a long-overdue corrective, centering African-Americans in a screen telling of their history. Also notable, both for its Black-centered storytelling and the ultra-independence of its 1983 release, is the little-seen <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2dw8\"><i>Sankofa</i></a> by Ethiopian filmmaker Haile Gerima—a member of the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1bWzq\">LA Rebellion</a> (and father of Merawi Gerima, whose debut <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oNQC\"><i>Residue</i></a> has just landed on Netflix). <i>Sankofa</i> transports a contemporary African-American fashion model back in time to a slave plantation; it’s both a reckoning and an awakening, in honor of the “stolen spirits of Africa”.</p><p>Yet “white savior” narratives are prevalent to this day, whether it’s the well-meaning, virtuous legal theater of Steven Spielberg’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1SZ4\"><i>Amistad</i></a> (1997) or the blaxploitation-tinged revisionist fantasia of Quentin Tarantino’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2cCk\"><i>Django Unchained</i></a> (2012). Even Steve McQueen’s much-lauded adaptation of abolitionist Solomon Northup’s memoir <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2D2e\"><i>12 Years a Slave</i></a> (2013) isn’t completely untethered from the assistance of a white hand.</p><p>Perhaps something thornier like Richard Fleischer’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/16Ww\"><i>Mandingo</i></a> (1975), frequently written off as a lurid, trashy potboiler imagining of the slave trade, deserves more than a cursory look for the way it removes clearly delineated archetypes of heroes and villains, and cathartic beats of obstacle and triumph, from the slave narrative. It exposes the poisoned capitalist pathology that produces the system—observing how souls, constantly besieged by hubris, greed and frail egos, self-implode as the unchecked power that comes with the commodification of human bodies grows.</p><!--figure[1]--><p>Now available digitally after its theatrical release was abandoned due to Covid, Gerard Bush and Christopher Rez’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/neiI\">Antebellum</a></i> contributes another complicated, fascinating wrinkle to the nuances of slavery cinema. The film arrives at a particularly volatile time, with additional resonance provided by the on-going, extremely topical plight of inequity faced by Black Americans.</p><p>Employing the malleable, high-concept language of genre to connect the sins of the past with the present—imagine something in the vicinity of Blumhouse doing Octavia E. Butler’s <i>Kindred</i>, or rebooting <i>Sankofa</i> for that matter—<i>Antebellum</i> is of a piece with the gathering momentum behind the popularity of recent Black-centered genre fare, from Jordan Peele’s horror outings <a href=\"https://boxd.it/eOCm\"><i>Get Out</i></a> (2017) and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gnV6\"><i>Us</i></a> (2019) to recent HBO shows like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ol5e\">Watchmen</a></i> and <i>Lovecraft Country</i>. The temporal tricksiness of the film’s narrative structure means spoiler-free synopsizing is a fool’s errand, but “it’s not a traditional horror”, Renz says, proffering “a thriller with horror elements” to describe it.</p><p>What is clear from the get-go is that something’s a little off, and the film potentially has one foot in <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. Opening with a quote from William Faulkner’s <i>Requiem for a Nun</i> (“The past is never dead. It’s not even past”), Bush and Renz, who shared writing and directing duties, waste no time thrusting us—via a visually stunning five-minute one-take tracking shot—onto an impossibly beautiful Louisiana plantation where we’re introduced to Eden, the first of two roles played by Janelle Monáe, a slave whose plans to escape are brutally thwarted by Confederate officers.</p><p>The filmmakers maintained vigilance in their recreation of trauma and the slave experience. “It was important to us that we not serve as co-conspirators to further erasure of American history and not white-wash the past,” says Bush. “But it was always of equal importance that we not engage in gratuitous violence. It was all for a meaning and purpose. So much of it is off-screen—we don’t have any physical whipping or anyone at the whipping post or any of that. This is to inform and educate and move the story forward. It’s not meant to serve as some sort of entertainment for violence sake.”</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Similarly, Bush says they were deliberate in their approach to using racial epithets of its time. The N-word is conspicuously absent for a film set in the Antebellum South. “It gives the audience an off-ramp to say, ‘That’s not language I would use so that’s not me, so I don’t have to engage in this and I don’t have to confront it’. These are the pantomimes of racism. The N-word and those words—they’re meant to dehumanize but just because you’re not hearing the word in the public square anymore—because it is no longer socially appropriate—doesn’t mean that all of the brutality and inequity that the word, the avatar, represented doesn’t exist anymore. It was important to us that we use the same language as <i>Gone with the Wind</i> in a way that they would refer to the enslaved people as the inferiors.”</p><p>In a purposefully disorienting plot shift, <i>Antebellum</i> moves off plantation grounds in its second act to establish Monáe’s second role, Veronica, a successful present-day academic promoting her new book <i>Shedding the Coping Persona</i>. Although the physical subjugation and barbarity of the past have disappeared, insidious micro-aggressions and hints remain, including the sinister presence of Jena Malone’s Southern antagonist Elizabeth, who also appears in both timelines.</p><p>For this portion, the film allows Veronica, who’s assertive, confident, free—the seeming mirror opposite of Eden—to live powerfully in her moment. Often accompanied by her bestie Dawn (a rambunctious, scene-stealing Gabourey Sidibe), these scenes foreground intersectionality, reflecting Bush and Renz’s desire to show Black women in a way that was familiar to them. “We’re surrounded by extraordinary Black women we see doing extraordinary things all the time.” Bush says. “We just don’t see it depicted on screen and we were determined that we had our opportunity, we were going to do that.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p>Stylish, visually stunning and effectively pointed, <i>Antebellum</i> marks a natural career progression for Bush and Renz, who began in advertising before moving into social advocacy work. “For Christopher and [me], that competitive side from advertising is what lent itself so beautifully to our waking up one day and saying we didn’t want to sell champagne for the rest of our lives, but that we needed to tell stories that mattered, especially after Trayvon was murdered.”</p><p>“Once we decided to make movies it was because we didn’t see anything in the marketplace that looked like us. I don’t think that with the finite amount of time that we have in our lives, from when we’re born to when we transition and exit out of this place, that you want to waste it committing your life to something you don’t think you can be the best at that—that you can make meaningful contribution.”</p>"

If there’s one thing we have, it’s a community of passionate film lovers. If there’s a way to bring the film industry and film lovers together at Letterboxd in a way that feels true to us, and leads to more film discovery, we’re on board.</p><p>So, we developed a new version of our classic profile that still looks and feels like the Letterboxd you love, but has a few extra things under the hood, like customized backdrops, a pinned list (and comment thread) front and center, the ability to publish stories (including YouTube videos and links to relevant news on other platforms), and the option to link to team members’ personal accounts.</p><p>We’re pleased to reveal our brand-new HQ tier, courtesy of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/members/hq/\">a few early adopters</a>: IndieWire, Film at Lincoln Center, NEON, TIFF, 70mm Podcast, The Black List, IFC, Legion M, Austin Film Society and our own crew account. This is the first beta—we expect to improve and extend over time—and you can follow these accounts immediately, on the web or in our apps (new versions with support are dropping today).</p>"

Their new feature <i>Chasing Dream</i> finds itself somewhere between those two, telling the story of an MMA fighter with gang ties named Tiger (Jacky Heung, winner of Fantasia’s Best Actor award) who falls in love with an aspiring singer named Cuckoo (Keru Wang).</p><p>To and Wai Ka Fai’s incredibly goofy sense of humor is still totally intact, as they make a complete farce out of the singing competition that Cuckoo enters, with her greatest competitor continually performing so hard that she accumulates injuries, until she ends up in a full-body cast. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/robotcookie/film/chasing-dream/\">As Michelle writes</a>: “It’s <i>Rocky</i> meets <i>A Star is Born</i>, with a dash of <i>American Idol</i>, a pinch of musical, and a huge dollop of romance.” This is all to say that <i>Chasing Dream</i> really is a hell of a lot of movie at once. <i>(KC)</i></p><!--figure[2]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/mNzW\">Labyrinth of Cinema</a></i></b><br/><i>Directed by Nobuhiko Ōbayashi, written by Kazuya Konaka, Nobu Obayashi and Tadashi Naitō</i></p><p>“It’s time to revisit our history to build a better future.” So begins <i>Labyrinth of Cinema</i>, the final film of Japanese experimental legend Nobuhiko Ōbayashi. Following a trilogy of films contemplating modern Japanese history and war (including the ravishing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hnUO\"><i>Hanagatami</i></a>), <i>Labyrinth</i> is a metatextual and metaphysical trip through the history of Japanese cinema and its intersection with war.<br/></p><p>A handful of young characters are quite literally absorbed into the screen of the cinema they’re sitting in at the film’s beginning, jumping through different eras and genres of film, tackling everything from war and propaganda, romance and musical, to chanbara and back again. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jakepcole/film/labyrinth-of-cinema/\">Jake Cole notes</a> the film’s surprising optimism, writing “even as  Ōbayashi grows more sober, the film conveys more and more his strength of belief that cinema is still a force for good, and that if the past cannot be helped, perhaps movies can be rethought and re-crafted to produce a better future”. <i>(KC)</i></p><!--figure[3]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oMAo\">Lapsis</a></i></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Noah Hutton</i></p><p>Noah Hutton (son of Timothy Hutton and Debra Winger) makes his narrative feature debut with a sci-fi-that’s-barely-sci-fi film, which dives into robotics, capitalism and unionization. Not a million miles away from the activist documentaries the director already has under his belt, <i>Lapsis</i> is a low-key, mordant film that captures gig-economy drudgery and the arcane fog of big tech. “Honestly really fucking cool,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1lvlyx\">writes David</a>, of Hutton’s world-building on a shoestring. “An intelligent and peculiar concept expertly executed and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.” Dean Imperial’s surliness is a treat. <i>(AY)</i></p><!--figure[4]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/qxV6\"><b></b>Bleed with Me</a></i></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Amelia Moses</i></p><p>Not one of <i>Bleed with Me</i>’s 79 minutes is wasted. If any of the following sound good to you—micro-thrillers, Robert Altman&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1nsS\"><i>Images</i></a>, Rodney Ascher’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/a3IE\">The Nightmare</a></i>, mumblecore Bergman—add Amelia Moses’ debut feature to your watchlist now. It’s an assured start from Moses, who crafts an unsettling, tantalizingly ambiguous atmosphere from the three-hander, cabin-in-the-snow confines, with Scrabble, gaslighting, bloodletting and sleep paralysis thrown in.<br/></p><p>“Lee Marshall anchors the film with a deeply moving performance as Rowan,” writes <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1k4egj\">Finhorror</a>. “With every facial expression, movement, and line reading, she sells vulnerability and discomfort while showing a minimal amount of effort.” Would pair well with Mickey Reece’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/n81m\"><i>Climate of the Hunter</i></a> (florid dinner conversations, immaculate food-porn and psycho-sexual tension) for an ace double feature. <i>(AY)</i></p><!--figure[5]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oXaw\">PVT CHAT</a></i></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Ben Hozie</i></p><p>New York filmmaker Ben Hozie examines online relationships and modern sexual fantasies with <i>PVT CHAT</i>, starring <i>Uncut Gems</i> breakout star Julia Fox as Scarlet, a cam-girl dominatrix. The film splits its focus between Scarlet and Jack (played by Peter Vack), an internet gambler who mostly remains inside his NYC apartment as he becomes fixated on her. While there’s palpable discomfort in Jack’s increasing obsession with Scarlet, the film doesn’t mock the practitioner nor the customer, and it doesn’t moralize over either of their actions—it simply leaves them plain to witness, as though a normal element of contemporary digital living.<b><br/></b></p><p>The genuineness of the relationship between Scarlet and Jack is ambiguous—the line between performance and sincere emotion distorted via pixels. As they continue to open up to each other the line blurs further, and <i>PVT CHAT</i> becomes a fascinating observation of how online communication has changed and commodified the ways in which we interact with each other. <i>(KC)</i><br/></p><!--figure[6]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kLgk\">Tezuka’s Barbara</a></i></b><br/><i>Directed by Makoto Tezuka, screenplay by Hisako Kurasawa</i></p><p>Speaking of obsessions, Japanese filmmaker Makoto Tezuka might have chosen his father’s strangest work to adapt into a live-action film. As it says in the title, <i>Tezuka’s Barbara</i> is an adaptation of ‘godfather of manga’ Osamu Tezuka’s <i>Barbara</i>, his most hallucinatory and sexually explicit work. Opening with a Nietzsche quote about madness and love, <i>Tezuka’s Barbara</i> more or less conflates the two, as the main character Yosuke, an author who specializes in lurid and trashy paperbacks, falls obsessively in love with Barbara, a homeless drifter he meets in the street. <b><br/></b></p><p>Beautifully lensed by Christopher Doyle, legendary cinematographer of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UDa\"><i>Chungking Express</i></a> and<i> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29tE\">In The Mood For Love</a></i>, <i>Tezuka’s Barbara</i> takes on a magical and ethereal quality, particularly in its sex scenes. Yosuke’s increasingly deranged obsession with Barbara and the young Tezuka’s depiction of it is compellingly weird, from its vivid colors and almost antiquated costuming to its <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2axs\"><i>Eyes Wide Shut</i></a>-esque rituals of the wealthy. Deranged, perhaps opaque, but a riveting visual journey, especially with its context in mind. <i>(KC)</i><br/></p><!--figure[7]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/o6qQ\">Special Actors</a></i></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Shinichiro Ueda</i></p><p><i>Special Actors</i> is the new film from Shinichiro Ueda, who turned heads with his bonkers cult film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/one-cut-of-the-dead/\"><i>One Cut of the Dead</i></a>. It may appear a little less surprising to those already familiar with his tactics, but it’s no less entertaining for it. <i>Special Actors</i> starts one way, as the tale of an aspiring actor looking for work, and ends somewhere else entirely. Brought into a company named ‘Special Actors’ by his estranged younger brother, Kazuko embarks on a different kind of performer’s journey, not just restricted to film and commercials, but also playing implanted mourners at funerals, fake boyfriends—whatever the client desires.</p><p>This is an Ueda film, so of course it takes a huge swerve, transforming into a bizarre and entertaining caper as the Special Actors are hired to infiltrate a cult. Ueda is more than aware of the classic conflation of film with “fakery” (as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/f-for-fake/\">Orson Welles would call it</a>)—the structure of a caper and its layers of illusion, truth and everything in between aligning with the requirements of stagecraft—and he has more than a little fun with it. As a result, so do we. <i>(KC)</i></p><!--figure[8]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oigS\">Feels Good Man</a></i></b><br/><i>Directed by Arthur Jones / Available on demand now</i></p><p>The internet was a mistake. Even if you try to stay out of the digital trash-fires, you’ll likely have heard of the ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme. Turns out, we need to pay attention to these things, particularly with another US election looming. In <i>Feels Good Man</i>, Arthur Jones introduces us to Matt Furie, the humble cartoonist behind the original Pepe, and then takes several wild and weird side-roads, with the most unexpected-but-entertaining talking heads, as we learn just how 4Chan and the alt-right adopted, weaponized and took the frog all the way to the White House, earning official hate-symbol status. “I came in expecting a solid documentary about a meme, and I ended up getting that and a compelling narrative about today’s troubling world,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1luxed\">writes Zach</a>. <i>(GG)</i><br/></p><!--figure[9]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/ogbw\">Sheep Without a Shepherd</a></i></b><br/><i>Directed by Sam Quah, written by Yang Weiwei</i></p><p>Dare we say “Letterboxd meets <i>Parasite</i>”? <i>Sheep Without a Shepherd</i>, Sam Quah’s debut feature (based on Jeethu Joseph’s highly rated film <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7avm\"><i>Drishyam</i></a>), is a cinephiliac feast about have-nots taking on upper-echelon corruption. Lead character Weijie (Xiao Yang) is a working-class, obsessive cinephile who vomits his movie knowledge any chance he can get. When his family is pulled into a case of police corruption, this same cinephilia may be the only thing that gets them out of it. It’s a sturdily wrought Hitchcockian homage, with a well-calibrated balance of suspense, humor and pathos.</p><p>“What a gut punch of a movie in the best way,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1kMlxJ\">writes Amanda</a>. “A little messy at times, especially in the end, and some questionable forensics, but this is something I’ll definitely be revisiting.” The jury is still out on whether the ending—make that the many endings—worked, but for the most part Letterboxd members enjoyed the cat-and-mouseness of it all, along with its moral questionability. <i>(AY)</i></p><!--figure[10]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/p1Uy\">You Cannot Kill David Arquette</a></i></b><br/><i>Directed by David Darg and Price James / Available on demand now</i></p><p><i>You Cannot Kill David Arquette</i> is a rousing, eye-opening and mostly upbeat gawk at the life of the Hollywood star whose fortunes have lately run dry. Although he is out of shape and has very young children (and very cute Basset hounds) to think of, Arquette is desperate to reignite his love of pro wrestling. In a quest to prove to his heroes that he’s serious about the sport, the actor participates in backyard wrestling matches in Virginia, joins street-fighters in Mexico, and goes down a K-hole at the hands of health professionals.</p><p>“Arquette is searching for a shred of legitimacy in a world that’s always made him feel like a fraud, and by the end of this loveable, hilarious, and ineffably heartfelt doc it’s almost impossible not to believe in him,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1jSNb5\">writes David Ehrlich</a>. As compelling a look at mental health as physical, the film benefits from the inclusion of conversations with those closest to Arquette (both of his wives feature), and there’s a heart-skipping scene involving the late Luke Perry. <i>(GG)</i></p><p>Lastly, our team wanted to shout out to Daria Woszek’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oMB2\"><i>Marygoround</i></a> for the best end credits dedication of the year. Thanks, Fantasia! Roll on 2021.<br/></p><!--figure[11]-->"

With his studio, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/studio/science-saru/\">Science Saru</a>, this year alone he directed two television series—the fantastic ode to animators, <i><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/keep-your-hands-off-eizouken\">Keep Your Hands off Eizouken!!</a>,</i> and the intense Netflix disaster series <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/qUOi\">Japan Sinks: 2020</a></i>—as well as the melancholy, romantic feature film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ride-your-wave/\"><i>Ride Your Wave</i></a>.</p><p><i>Inu-Oh</i> looks to be just as imaginative and wild as anything else Yuasa-san has made, based on the work-in-progress glimpse at Annecy. Set in fourteenth-century Japan, the film is based on Hideo Furukama’s novel about the legendary masked Noh theater performer Inu-Oh, born with “unique characteristics”, which lead them to cover their entire body. Both novel and film focus on their close friendship with the blind biwa hōshi (lute priest) Tomona, and the success they find together.</p><p>“We often think of history as moving in one straight line, but it actually branches off, and people and events in those branches have been forgotten or disappeared,” Yuasa-san said during the Annecy preview. <i>Inu-Oh</i> explores those hidden branches through an anachronistic reimagining of the roots of traditional Japanese entertainment. The main idea: what if the performers of Noh theater were treated like Japan’s pop idols of today? Yuasa-san described the main characters as “kind of like The Beatles” of 1300s Japan.</p><p>On credits alone there’s a lot of promise, with the legendary <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/taiyo-matsumoto/\">Taiyō Matsumoto</a>— the mangaka who created <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/taiyo-matsumoto/\">Tekkonkinkreet</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/taiyo-matsumoto/\">Ping Pong</a></i> (and collaborated with Yuasa-san on the latter’s fantastic anime adaptation)—lending his eccentric yet elegant designs to the film. The preview opened with minute movements comprised of rough, wide almost painterly brushstrokes, an art style almost completely unlike anything Yuasa-san has done previously.</p><p>As it turns out, this is but one way of representing the world of <i>Inu-Oh</i>, through the perspective of Tomona, a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/notes-on-blindness-2016/\"><i>Notes on Blindness</i></a>-esque way of representing how Tomona perceives things. From those small glimpses, <i>Inu-Oh</i> looks to be a beautiful, anthropological piece built with both the same free-form style that characterizes the rest of his work, and perhaps something more classical as well.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wolfwalkers/\">Wolfwalkers</a></b><br/>Directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart / Coming to theaters and Apple TV+ in late 2020 after a <a href=\"https://www.tiff.net/events/wolfwalkers\">September 12 premiere at TIFF</a></i></p><p>Made and set in Kilkenny, home to the acclaimed animation studio Cartoon Saloon, the much-anticipated <i>Wolfwalkers</i> is inspired by animation’s past, Celtic legend, and the local area’s history. Set in 1650, <i>Wolfwalkers</i> takes place amidst attempts by the English (Cromwell, specifically) to pacify and tame Ireland. Representative of those wild elements the English are seeking to eradicate are the ‘wolfwalkers’—people blessed by Saint Patrick with the power to leave their bodies at night and become wolves during their sleep (Irish werewolves, essentially). The story follows an English girl, Robyn Goodfellowe (Honor Kneafsey), who moves to Ireland with her father Bill (Sean Bean), to help carry out Cromwell’s plan to kill the wolves.</p><p>Like his previous film, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/song-of-the-sea/\">Song of the Sea</a></i> (2014), co-director Tomm Moore says this new film is based upon a childhood story common amongst those living in Kilkenny. And like his previous films (including 2009’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1sMI\"><i>The Secret of Kells</i></a>), it looks to be a visual feast, with a mixture of dynamic camera styles, pre-viz work and hand-drawn animation for moments like its ‘wolf-vision’. Moore draws the ideological divide between the English and the Irish into every scratch of pencil, the occupied cities comprised of rigid lines and angular designs, while the forest and its inhabitants are more free-flowing and unkempt.</p><p>Moore cited the rough charcoal lines of Isao Takahata’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-tale-of-the-princess-kaguya/\"><i>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</i></a> as one influence on the Cartoon Saloon animators’ approach; the way that Robin is drawn gradually changing along with her worldview. Cartoon Saloon is yet to make a bad film, and <i>Wolfwalkers</i> looks like it might be the company’s most beautiful myth yet.</p><p><i>Stay tuned to <a href=\"http://letterboxd.show\">The Letterboxd Show</a> for an interview with Tomm Moore.</i></p><!--figure[3]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/over-the-moon-2020/\">Over The Moon</a></b><br/>Directed by Glen Keane / Due on Netflix, late 2020</i></p><p>The feature directorial debut of animation legend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/glen-keane/\">Glen Keane</a>, early glimpses of <i>Over The Moon</i> look utterly bonkers. A long-time character animator for Disney, having worked on almost all of the studio’s animation output since <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UBy\">Pete’s Dragon</a></i> in 1977, Keane looks to be bringing his vast array of talents to his first feature film. The trailer alone shows off a vast blend of styles, from the 3DCG (three-dimensional computer graphics) and more realistic lighting that we’ve come to expect from Disney animation, as well as the more textured, hand-drawn work the director cut his teeth on.</p><p>The story itself sounds wild, though it starts out simple enough: Fei Fei (Cathy Ang) is enraptured by her parents’ stories of a goddess living on the moon. After her mother passes away, Fei Fei begins to believe the story is true, and decides to build a rocket to get there. There’s also a hint of something living there. Whatever the answer is, I’m curious to see it, and with a star-studded cast that includes the likes of John Cho and Sandra Oh, how could I turn it down?</p><!--figure[4]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lupin-the-3rd-the-first/\">Lupin III: The First</a></b><br/>Directed by Takashi Yamazaki / Released in select territories; wider release due late 2020</i></p><p>Takashi Yamazaki’s <i>Lupin III: The First</i>, the first 3DCG-animated <i>Lupin III</i> feature film, looks rather incredible. It’s the latest in a vast, 50-year history of anime based on the manga from the late Kazuhiko Katō (known by the pen name Monkey Punch). Despite that long history, the <i>Lupin III</i> franchise has always managed to resist being made obsolete; part of its ongoing appeal is its ability to continuously adapt to new contexts and styles while retaining its simple charms, and <i>The First</i> is no different.</p><p>The film announces itself in the same way as ever, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqZD7VYsgXc\">the iconic ‘Lupin III’ theme</a> blaring over a flashy title sequence that builds off familiar iconography, as well as moments from the franchise’s history. It revels in the style of old-school caper the show continues to embrace, taking delight in the exploits of a modern-day gentleman thief who announces his robberies with calling cards.</p><p>Even with the new and unfamiliar animation style, <i>Lupin III: The First</i> feels like a classic <i>Lupin III</i> tale, taking the story back to the 1960s (the decade during which the character was created), and even putting its main character back in his classic red suit. Each character design translates surprisingly well to this mode of animation—Lupin’s gangly frame, as well as the unique appearances of his compatriots Goemon, Fujiko, Zenigata and Jigen (who looks bizarrely attractive in this—although, to be fair, “everyone in this movie is f—king sexy” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1g8B43\">according to Letterboxd member London</a>. Accurate).</p><p>Yamazaki does well to avoid the often sterile feeling of 3DCG animation by having these characters all move like the cartoons they’re based on (for starters, a long-running visual gag of Lupin leaping straight out of his clothes). It might take some adjustment (which for me, only really lasted up to the opening credits) before it becomes fully dazzling. <i>Lupin III: The First</i> might be the most exciting action caper of 2020, in any medium.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-legend-of-hei/\">The Legend of Hei</a></b><br/>Directed by Mtjj / Released in China late 2019; international release TBA</i></p><p>Rivalling <i>Lupin III: The First</i> for most flamboyant animation on show at Annecy was <i>The Legend of Hei</i>, a feature-length prequel to the Flash web cartoon <i>The Legend of Luo Xiaohei</i> by Chinese artist Mtjj (real name Zhang Ping).</p><p>The series tells the story of the spirit Luo Xiaohei, who takes the appearance of a small black cat before being adopted by a young girl. The film’s story focuses more squarely on the cat, Xiaohei, who transforms into a man and goes on to live in the forest, his carefree existence soon interrupted by the discovery that humans are beginning to encroach on that territory as their cities expand, and technological progress puts the two worlds increasingly at odds.</p><p>As the film explores more of Xiaohei’s origins, the thick, clean line-work and cute art style disguises a much grander, epic conflict at play, realized in some wildly animated fight scenes. (“Starts off small and adorable, then expands into an epic conflict on an <i>Akira</i> scale,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1fh5Yd\">writes Tasha Robinson</a>.) The 2D-animated film allegedly took five years to produce, Mtjj saying in an interview that the complete film, at 100 minutes, <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2019-09/06/content_75180088.htm\">required more than 70,000 drawings</a>—or around twelve per second.</p><p>With its gentle score and clash of the spiritual world with the modern, the environmentally conscious work of Studio Ghibli comes to mind, as does the Nickelodeon series <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> (perhaps the most popular consideration of East Asian spirituality in the West, especially with its resurgence of popularity thanks to Netflix). <i>The Legend of Hei</i> enjoyed an extremely lucrative run in China in late 2019 thanks to the original cartoon’s sizeable fanbase at home. No news yet on who will pick the film up in the West.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/on-gaku-our-sound/\"><b>ON-GAKU: Our Sound</b></a></b><br/>Directed by Kenji Iwaisawa / Expected to release late 2020</i></p><p>Rotoscoped by hand over a period of seven years, the independently produced anime <i>ON-GAKU: Our Sound</i> has a rather appropriate match of creator and subject: a film about amateur musicians made by amateur animators.</p><p>Director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kenji-iwaisawa/\">Kenji Iwaisawa</a> adapted the film from Hiroyuki Ohashi’s cult manga, and there’s a charm to the rudimentary style of its art, the plain faces of its characters resembling the designs of something like ONE’s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5897304/\"><i>Mob Psycho 100</i></a>, while also matching that show’s deadpan, oddball sense of humor. The laid-back voice acting only adds to that effect, as main character Kenji and his cohort’s obvious excitement flattened into a consistently amusing monotone.</p><p>It’s not quite a classic tale of underdog artistry, as the group never really gets better, but the film embraces the primordial noise that emerges whenever they pick up an instrument. Iwaisawa takes the characters seriously, showing their raucous and unconventional performances with complete sincerity. “Loved the deadpan humor and appreciated the message about how art can act as an impetus for positive change in our lives,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hsW8f\">writes Dan</a>.</p><p>Passion, companionship and collaboration is what’s most important to <i>Our Sound</i>. It’s a deeply weird film, but one filled with great ambition and visual wonder, increasing in boldness as it goes. The different styles of coloring and expression that emerge beyond its initial palettes are radical enough to catch anyone off guard.</p><!--figure[7]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/connected-2020/\">Connected</a></b><br/>Directed by Michael Rianda / Releasing in most territories in October 2020 (October 23 in the US)</i></p><p><i>Connected</i> is the next step for Sony Animation as it moves in an exciting new direction (the studio recently stated that it would be green-lighting <a href=\"https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/sony-animation-prez-kristine-belson-coronavirus-will-lead-to-more-pg-13-and-r-rated-animated-movies-193790.html\">more animation aimed at adults</a>). Produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, off the back of their immensely popular film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/\"><i>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse</i></a>, <i>Connected</i> is imbued with the same kind of idiosyncrasy and innovation that made <i>Spider-Verse</i> a mega-hit.</p><p>From first-time feature director Michael Rianda, best known for his work on TV’s <i>Gravity Falls</i>, <i>Connected</i> is a family-road-trip-AI-apocalypse movie, based on the bizarre chemistry of Rianda’s own family. Formerly known as <i>The Mitchells vs The Machines</i>, the film looks at the push and pull between technology and human relationships, and how different generations respond to the ongoing changes in how we interact online and personally.</p><p>While this isn’t animated “on twos” (where each frame of character animation holds for two frames of background movement) as <i>Spider-Verse</i> often was, <i>Connected</i> also attempts to maintain a ‘drawn’ quality in its art. Characters move fluidly, but with clear outlines drawn from simple shapes. There’s also a strong contrast between the lived-in detail of human habitats versus the stark minimalism of the domain of the robots.</p><p>Thankfully the clips from the film don’t look nearly as finger-wavy and luddite as the trailers might suggest. (They appear to take the Boomer point of view that technology unequivocally ruins everything, but we know it’s more complicated than “screens bad”). In any case, it looks like the beginning of an interesting run for Sony Animation, and I’m keen to see how it turns out.</p><!--figure[8]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-summit-of-the-gods/\">The Summit of the Gods (Le Sommet des Dieux)</a></b><br/>Directed by Patrick Imbert / Due to release 2021</i></p><p><i>Le Sommet des Dieux</i> distinguishes itself in this list by being the one most firmly grounded in reality, but it’s by no means less wondrous. Based on Jirô Taniguchi’s five-volume manga <i>Le Sommet des Dieux</i>—itself based on the 1998 novel by Baku Yumemakura—the story starts with the question of whether George Mallory died going up or coming down the summit of Mount Everest on June 8, 1924. 70 years later, Fukamachi, a young Japanese reporter, stumbles across a camera potentially belonging to Mallory, and embarks on an adventure of his own with his friend Hasu Joji.</p><p>In close collaboration with the mangaka Taniguchi-san, who passed away during development, director Patrick Imbert seeks to replicate his art style, which was more aligned with that of European comics than traditional manga, with less exaggerated and highly detailed line-work. The team also looked outward from Taniguchi-san’s art, to the character designs of works such as Hiroyuki Okiura’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jin-roh-the-wolf-brigade/\">Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade</a>,</i> as well as his 2011 film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-letter-to-momo\"><i>A Letter To Momo</i></a>, and the films of the late, great <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/satoshi-kon/\">Satoshi Kon</a>.</p><p>From what I saw at Annecy, there’s something of a mix between what Imbert calls the “documented detail” of Taniguchi-san’s work and simpler design for the larger urban spaces. To accomplish this, the studio draws its traditional 2D using modern techniques, such as “movie-style” framing—locations and interiors created in 3D software and then overpainted for detail, identity and authenticity.</p><p>The <i>Summit of the Gods</i> also seeks to recapture the detailed and subtle realism of Yumemakura-san’s depiction of George Mallory, with low-key voice performances conducted in shared sessions; recording movements and hiring a boom operator to make the sound more akin to live action, perhaps even more natural. Though production has already been long, the studio had thankfully pre-empted the long delays of Covid-19, so let’s hope we get to see the film with our own eyes, soon.</p><!--figure[9]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sirocco-and-the-kingdom-of-the-winds/\">Sirocco and the Kingdom of the Winds</a></b><br/></i><i>Directed by Benoît Chieux / Scheduled for 2022</i></p><p>An original fable from animation director Benoît Chieux, <i>Sirocco and the Kingdom of the Winds</i> is still very much in the midst of production, with an expected release in 2022. It looks captivating; a surreal tale set in an imaginary kingdom with delicate and clearly defined artwork, about a being named Sirocco, a despised figure with the power to control the wind, who is forced into solitude by the denizens of this world.</p><p>The dream kingdom resembles a <i>Spirited Away</i>-esque land, with its own hierarchy and bizarre set of rules, mundanity mixed in with visual wonder. Flying crocodiles, living houses and strange humanoids populate it, and the main characters, a pair of girls named Carmen and Juliette, turn into cats themselves. All are drawn with wavy lines, soft colours and fluid movement, the surreal presented with an inviting rather than foreboding air.</p><!--figure[10]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time/\"><i>Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0</i></a></b><br/><i>Directed by Hideaki Anno and others / 2020 release delayed; keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evangelion_co\">official Twitter account</a> for a new date</i></p><p>Hideaki Anno is set to bring his earth-shaking <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> franchise to a close, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/neon-genesis-evangelion-the-end-of-evangelion/\">again</a>, with the fourth instalment of his ‘Rebuild’ series of films, <i>Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0</i>. Delayed for almost a decade now (the previous instalment came out in 2012!), and delayed again by Covid-19, the film looks to close out a grand rewriting of the original series that shot Anno-san and former studio Gainax to fame—“Bye Bye, All of Evangelion” the tagline reads. But we’re gonna have to wait a while longer to bid this final farewell.</p><p>Made with co-director Kazuya Tsurumaki (who has served as director with Anno-san since the original series), the first ‘Rebuild’ film, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/evangelion-10-you-are-not-alone/\"><i>Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone</i></a>, seemed to be a fairly conventional remake, updating the visuals and score with more modern techniques. The story starts the same: the isolated, depressed and self-loathing teenager Shinji Ikari is forced by his absentee father to help fight the mysterious, giant, alien ‘Angels’ by getting in an equally mysterious big robot called an Evangelion (“Eva” for short). He finds no self-fulfilment in this, and if anything, the close contact with other people only seems to push him further into himself. So far, so familiar.</p><p>However, the second film, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/evangelion-20-you-can-not-advance/\"><i>Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance</i></a>, veered completely off the rails in the best way possible, destroying audience preconceptions. The line between sequel and remake was fascinatingly blurred, and only continued to get weirder with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/evangelion-30-you-can-not-redo/\">Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo</a>,</i> as the story landed in completely unfamiliar territory, altering its characters beyond recognition while adding entirely new characters in the process. It’s now almost impossible to predict what <i>3.0 + 1.0</i> will be. The only footage available so far was a wild ten-minute clip in which the Eiffel Tower is wielded as a weapon by an Eva. We were <i>this close</i>.</p><!--figure[11]--><p>There are almost too many gifts, even just from Annecy alone, to describe at length. A couple more worth mentioning: Anja Daiman’s musical comedy <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-island-3/\"><i>The Island</i></a> looks fascinating for its reclamation of the colonialist story of Robinson Crusoe; and Yuta Murano’s first anime feature <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/our-seven-day-war/\"><i>Our Seven-Day War</i></a> promises plenty of plot twists amidst the actions of rebellious youth. A range of beguiling short films were also on display—a selection helpfully compiled <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/iknow/list/annecy-2020/\">here</a> by Letterboxd member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/iknow/\">Iknow</a>.</p><p>Outside of Annecy, other films are finally arriving, virtually or otherwise—such as Gints Zilbalodis’s peculiar and quiet <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/away-2019/\"><i>Away</i></a>, and Ayumu Watanabe’s beautiful and surreal <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/children-of-the-sea/\"><i>Children of the Sea</i></a> (with music from none other than Joe Hisaishi!). Though not all animation is comfort food by default—it is simply a medium, after all—it’s reassuring knowing that animated films are able to continue, in some form, through the pandemic.</p>"

In a day and age when, literally and figuratively, the United States has its knee on the necks of Black Americans, to lose such a great man who was committed to fighting these culture wars through the medium of film is a huge blow for those who appreciated his talents and his activism. It’d be tempting to say that he only played a superhero in the movies. But his performances are buoyed by his off-screen words and deeds, which emphatically demonstrate his commitment to elevating his people through on-screen performances.</p><p>“You’re a strong, Black man in a world that conflicts with that strength, that really doesn’t want you to be great,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/movies/chadwick-boseman-black-panther.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">Boseman told <i>The New York Times</i>’ Reggie Ugwu</a> in 2019. “So what makes you the one who’s going to stand tall?” As an actor, he was always mindful of how Black men were portrayed and perceived in the media. And because of this, he carefully and convincingly carved out a niche for himself as someone who was determined to offer a broader spectrum of Black images and stories. In an era when Black athletes are being told to shut up and dribble, Boseman chose to take on the role of Jackie Robinson in <i>42</i> (2013).</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>For Robinson, shutting up and dribbling (or swinging, in Robinson’s case) was the only option. And in this starring role, Boseman fit like a glove, portraying a man who carried the weight of a generation of Black ballplayers on his shoulders. While portraying the man who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Boseman delivered a performance of quiet strength. It mirrored Robinson’s own commitment to non-aggression amid the threats he faced. </p><p>As you watch the film and learn more about the man, you come to realize that you’re not watching someone imitate Jackie Robinson. You’re watching someone step into the shoes of a man with whom he shared similar values. Because of this, the performance and the emotional impact of the film carries immense power. This impact was duplicated in much of Boseman’s later work.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Over the years, Boseman continued to challenge himself with further roles portraying historical and iconic figures. And there was never a role that was too weighty for the Howard-educated, Oxford-trained actor. Before “Black Lives Matter” became the phrase of the moment, he was already informing an industry and an audience that—if they didn’t know already—he was Black and proud of it, as he portrayed the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, in 2014’s <i>Get on Up</i>. </p><p>As our broader culture continues to criminalize Black men from the womb to the tomb, Boseman chose to take on the role of eventual Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, telling, in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dJWa\"><i>Marshall</i></a> (2017), the story of a man who was committed to the rule of law while also dismantling systems of oppression that unjustly and disproportionately impacted Black men and women in America.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>And when certain individuals—such as the current president of the United States—referred to our place of origin (Africa) as “shithole countries”, while also telling certain Americans to “go back…” to the “places from which they came”, Boseman and Ryan Coogler gave us a destination worth yearning for with 2018’s <i>Black Panther</i>.</p><p>I created my <a href=\"https://boxd.it/15epu\">Black Life in Film</a> list because I was fed up with my inability to locate a catalog of films that properly represented the Black experience, both in the US and abroad. In the four years I have been adding to the list (and its many genre spin-offs), Boseman has been out there, reinforcing its existence, by creating and starring in roles that have given me the uplifting depictions that I and so many others craved. He used his God-given talents to provide portrayals of Black life that are true to our experience, and he never, ever, wavered from that commitment.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>Given his acting chops and dynamic personality, Boseman could’ve easily chased the fast bucks while in Hollywood. But instead, he decided to carry the weight of his country’s history, oftentimes its original sins, throughout his life in Hollywood. And he never backed down from the responsibility that came with this challenge. It’s a burden that not too many can shoulder, but Boseman never saw it that way. It was always a blessing; an opportunity to showcase not just the best that Black America had to offer, but the best that America had to offer as well. Because his story and the story of Black resilience, innovation and heroism is the story of America too.</p><p>We are so fortunate to have the long-lasting power of cinema. Even though he’s gone, Chadwick Aaron Boseman’s legacy will live on through the timely and dignified body of work he left behind.</p><p>—<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/adam_davie/\">Adam Davie</a></i></p><p><!--figure[6]--></p>"

Want to win an Oscar or pen a ‘proper play’ which will stand the test of time? Make sure your story includes a good spate of killing, a family rift, a mother with dead babies or a father betrayed by his wicked daughters, something of that ilk… A good smattering of tears, heartbreak, untimely demise and vengeance—usually with a pile of bodies stacked up by the end. Drama of the highest order should be serious, they say.</p><p>And yet, if you were to be shipwrecked on a desert island with only one DVD to watch on repeat for the rest of eternity, what would you choose?</p><p>I&rsquo;m guessing something that makes your heart sing.</p><p>Why is it that we’re so ready to look past the bright for the bleak, reject the optimism for the politically painful, the comedy, dare I say it—the ‘rom-com’—for a good descent into depression? I don’t know about you, but the narratives which have come to mean the most to me, and made me think most deeply, have been stories with some sunshine in their bones.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>The value of laughter, of a sense of hope and possibility, the chance to feel better about life… why do we not celebrate that? That is medicine. And the chance to escape. What an incredible gift that can be. How powerful that a good story can transport away from life’s hardships and liberate us, at least for a time.</p><p>A well told story with hope at its heart can illuminate life’s important lessons just as intelligently as the darkest tragedy. It can still break your heart, make you cry, give you ‘all the feels’, but in a way which leaves you walking out of the cinema, the theater, the library, with a spring in your step and a little more belief in the good things in life. A happy ending, trite as it sounds, often reminds us to embrace life. To get out there and live it, and to appreciate what we have. And that, I think, is invaluable.</p><p>While I was making <i>Summerland</i>, in an unexpected and tragic parallel with the film, my own father became seriously ill. Knowing that he had a finite amount of time left, he flatly refused to watch anything depressing or morbid, choosing instead only to engage with stories which would brighten his day. Why dwell on how painful life can be when you only have limited time? He chose to make the most of it.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>We all have limited time. And at that moment in my own life, I made a commitment to always tell stories with hope at their heart. There are plenty of filmmakers who make epic, searing tragedies. They do it much better than I could—I have no ambition to be one of them. Instead, I want to spend my own finite amount of time making films which can uplift, make you think, suggest that, however bleak prospects seem, there is always the possibility of good, of hope, even if it’s just a glimmer.</p><p>I want to make films my dad would have enjoyed. I’m not talking about filmic candy-floss—cynically constructed, formulaic films made just to win laughs and box office numbers. I mean stories with something to say. Something positive. And if I am lucky enough to make a film where the audience leaves the cinema feeling a little bit better about life than when they arrived, then I’ve done my job.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/50-heart-filled-tales-for-troubling-times/\">Here are my top 50 films that do exactly that for me</a>. Heart-filled tales for troubling times. Some comedies, some dramas, some classics, some foolish fun, but all of which have, to me, felt like a life-enhancing tonic when I watched them. I hope you enjoy them too—and add to the collection.</p><p>My dad, I think, would heartily approve.</p>"

Olivia knows the only way to legal status in present-day America is through marriage, but struggles to find the right person to accept her offer.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>Green-card marriages also cost money. Olivia takes a job as a live-in caregiver for Olga (Lynn Cohen), an elderly Russian woman living in Brooklyn’s Brighton Beach neighborhood. She soon finds a love interest in her client’s grandson Alex (Australian actor Eamon Farren), and her future seems solidified. Or is it? As anxiety about deportation mounts, Olivia strives to maintain autonomy in a world that continually rejects her.</p><p>The slow, meditative nature of <i>Lingua Franca</i> has already found fans on Letterboxd. “Trans narratives are so often couched in dramatic twists and turns, but here we get something so much more gentle,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1gpDKf\">writes Connor</a>. Sandoval’s turn as a woman searching for her truth while existing at the intersections of marginalization is also hitting home. “This is the hardest I&rsquo;ve been struck by a performance since Jeon Do-yeon&rsquo;s masterful display in Lee Chang-dong&rsquo;s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/27CY\">Secret Sunshine</a></i> back in 2007,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1jKKTd\">writes Joshua</a>. “I really cannot believe this is Isabel&rsquo;s first performance and I certainly believe that it won&rsquo;t be her last.”</p><p>Sandoval instinctively injects concepts of immigration, loneliness, and displacement throughout <i>Lingua Franca</i> in a way that doesn’t overwhelm, but does force deep empathy. “Artfully plays with a lot of themes at once,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1i7VoX\">agrees Letterboxd member Oluwatayo</a>.</p><p>Merriam-Webster’s definition of ‘lingua franca’—“something resembling a common language”—can be interpreted in various ways. For Sandoval, she aims to create her own common language of passion, pain and new beginnings. With migrant workers sharing a common language of homesickness in every corner of the world, I had to ask why she chose New York to be the setting for this emotional drama.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>Letterboxd: What is it about New York that made the setting work for you and <i>Lingua Franca</i>? Is it the diversity of the environment or…?<br/></b><i>Isabel Sandoval:</i> You know, growing up in the Philippines, New York was seen as romantic. I wanted to put my stamp and unique views of life in New York City. I wanted to do two things with <i>Lingua Franca</i>: I wanted to do my own New York movie from the perspective and the gaze of a foreigner and an immigrant, and I wanted to make a different kind of film that was quiet and patient. I wrote the script around the time when Trump got elected president, which painted a perfect storm for the premise, story and view of the film. I was also influenced by the James Gray film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Ws4\">Two Lovers</a>,</i> which was filmed in Brighton Beach.</p><p><b>That’s not an easy thing to accomplish in a New York movie, yet you manage to do that with such patience and quiet and subtlety. I was shocked. But, you know, New York is not all crazy. There are places that are quiet.<br/></b>Exactly! Especially in Brooklyn. I wanted to capture the different worlds that exist block to block in the film.</p><p><b>Your movie deals with a lot of themes: family, immigration and romance…<br/></b>I’m always drawn to stories with a socio-political point of view about women who are marginalized and forced to make intensely personal decisions. French filmmaker <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jean-cocteau/\">Jean Cocteau</a> once said: “Filmmakers make the same movie over and over”. As you progress and make more films, and you’re being involved as a storyteller, you’re beginning to polish; your style becomes more evident and sophisticated. That’s just the story I felt attached to because it was one I was passionate about and it was the right time to create it.</p><p><b>How do you feel about being embraced by the film community, both domestically and abroad? Tribeca, Locarno, SXSW and Venice are among the festivals that have premiered your films.<br/></b>It’s vindicating to me. My first feature film shot and produced in the US screened internationally, but, with <i>Lingua Franca,</i> it’s come full circle. I think critics now embrace and know that I have a voice and a sensibility that’s worth exploring more. They want to involve a filmmaker with different views, especially in an industry where you need to conform to certain formulas and certain group things in terms of how we approach certain issues or certain things or certain ideas. It truly makes me feel independent.</p><p>Art-house film and cinema has long been associated, or at least for the last fifteen years, with really gritty, social-realist drama. I’ve received reviews of my film that criticize it for not being romantic enough. My film captures emotions that are not easy, obvious and straightforward. I’m not the type of filmmaker that is into crowd-pleasing and I think that resonates with audiences.</p><p><b>You are the director, the star, the editor, and the producer of <i>Lingua Franca</i>. How did you stay organized enough to manage all of those tasks?<br/></b>I have one job and that is to make a film and tell a story. I had a clear vision of what I wanted to accomplish, and honestly, it’s me being a stubborn auteur.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>The camera work is really sensual and intimate. What conversations took place between you and cinematographer, Isaac Banks, and what, if any other films, were the inspiration for that look?<br/></b>He and I discussed patience and sensuality often, so that’s why Wong Kar-wai had quite an influence on my work with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29tE\">In the Mood for Love</a></i> and also Christian Petzold, the German director, who directed <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/gUK6\">Transit</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/7u46\">Phoenix</a></i>.</p><p><b><i>Lingua Franca</i> places a particular lens on the fragility of Filipino, migrant culture. In the film, Olivia exists at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, ICE and Covid-19—and you lay that all on the table here. What do you hope the audience will see in Olivia’s story at this time?<br/></b>She’s a trans woman, she is a woman of color, she is an immigrant, but she’s also more than the sum of these individual parts. I know my film demands a lot of intellectual and emotional labor, but it’s important that viewers think deeply and critically about Olivia’s motivations, which may seem contradictory and complex. I want <i>Lingua Franca</i> to be an emotional experience, even if it’s not the most comfortable to watch. If I get one audience member to do the emotional legwork of trying to understand where the main character is coming from, I will feel complete as a filmmaker.</p><p><b>What do you think is the must-see Filipino film, classic or new?<br/></b>[Peque Gallaga’s] <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/6ezq\">Oro, Plata, Mata</a></i>, which came out in 1982. It is a multi-generational tale set in central Philippines. It’s just a sprawling, dramatic epic, and it’s one of the films that made me want to be a filmmaker.  It’s not the most technically polished film, but it takes risks narratively. At the end of the day, it’s not about how big the production is. It’s your willingness to be expansive and explorative as a filmmaker that counts.</p><p><b>What do you consider the sexiest film you’ve ever seen?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/28R6\">Out of Sight</a></i> by Steven Soderbergh.</p><p><b><i>Out of Sight</i>?! I did not see that coming.<br/></b>Yes! That film doesn’t have any sex scene, but it’s the level of seduction for me. I think sensuality is not necessarily a physical encounter between bodies, but the patience and longing of the moment.</p><p><b>What is your all-time favorite comfort film?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UdG\">A League of Their Own</a></i> by Penny Marshall. That was the first movie that I saw where I bawled in the last ten minutes of the film.</p><p><b>If I were doing a triple feature with <i>Lingua Franca</i>, what two films would you recommend to watch before or after?<br/></b>I would recommend <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aRi\">Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</a></i> by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, which is another interracial love story between a German woman and a Moroccan immigrant. The other one would be <i>Two Lovers</i> by James Gray, which is set by the beach.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i>[Spoiler warning: The final two questions concern aspects of the film’s ending.]</i></p><p><b>I thought the ending of your film was powerful, because we’re right back at the beginning of Olivia’s journey. Sometimes things don’t work out and you have to pick up the pieces and move forward.<br/></b>Exactly! I also wanted to make a point that even though we are focusing on Olivia, I pulled the camera back to highlight bigger sociological themes. She is one of many immigrants in the script and their fates are not resolved by the end of this movie. I wanted that to be a subtle reminder this type of thing becomes cyclical. Life goes on, it’s just another day. Olivia is a displaced immigrant woman in America where Trump is president. Whereas Olga, who’s Ukranian-Jewish, left her home country fifty or sixty years ago in the aftermath of the Holocaust. I wanted people to see this connection.</p><p><b>Based on the meaning of ‘lingua franca’, was that your original choice or for the title? The definition really fits the story.<br/></b>The film is an invitation to the audience to really pay closer attention to language—the language of things said and unsaid. That probably was also a big point of decision for me to open and close the film with words in Tagalog, which is my native language. A lot of people have asked “why didn’t Olivia accept the marriage proposal?” at the end of the film. Sure, that would’ve been practical, but I invite the audience to look at the language between Alex and Olivia. I challenge them to look beyond Olivia as just an immigrant without papers or as a trans woman looking for love, but this is a woman who is taking her agency back and her ability to determine her life moving forward.</p>"

It messed me up! It’s a nightmare! Pure Cronenberg body horror as far as four-year-old me was concerned and I’ve been too scared to ever watch it again. The nightmarish image of terrified children slowly morphing into donkeys after drinking beer and smoking is burned into my brain forever. Thanks, Disney.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b><i>Mean Streets</i> (1973)</b><br/><i>Directed by Martin Scorsese</i></p><p>“<a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aSU\"><i>Mean Streets</i></a>—okay, not a film you’d immediately expect on this list but when Harvey Keitel gets wasted in the bar and suddenly the angle switches to a camera literally strapped to his body to perfectly visualize his drunken state, right down to the camera collapsing on the floor with him… it’s incredible. I think because it’s also otherwise a serious naturalistic film and then you get this almost music-video visual in a 1973 film. It reminds you of how punk rock Scorsese really is—it’s bold, fourth-wall-breaking and technically genius, too, as that rig must’ve been hell back then with big clunky heavy film cameras. No GoPros back then!”</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b><i>Requiem for a Dream</i> (2000)</b><br/><i>Directed by Darren Aronofsky</i></p><p>“This technique got reused brilliantly again to show an intense state of drugged minds in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29VI\">Requiem for a Dream</a></i> where now, with much smaller and lighter cameras, they could push it even further and do long takes with the camera literally strapped to the cast.”</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b><i>Trainspotting</i> (1996)</b><br/><i>Directed by Danny Boyle</i></p><p>“<a href=\"https://boxd.it/29XY\"><i>Trainspotting</i></a> was a life-changing film for me. It came out in my early teens and as a Scottish teenager it was (and still is) the coolest, most energetic and unpredictable film I’d seen. Danny Boyle juggles the magically surreal with the depressingly miserable in a way that still feels like a near-impossible tightrope walk. Drug visuals normally use post-production or animation but here the in-camera simplicity of Renton slowly sinking into the carpet grave as he overdoses is so simple and perfect. (Shout-out to the nightmare of ceiling baby in this film too, though.)”</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b><i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> (1998)</b><br/><i>Directed by Terry Gilliam</i></p><p>“An obvious choice, but the carpet slowly crawling up the legs of a man on the phone in the lobby is a beauty that stayed with me for years, and though I’ve never taken ether in Vegas, I imagine Terry Gilliam’s visuals in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/27Xs\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a></i> are very accurate for the experience too.”</p><!--figure[7]--><p><b><i>Enter the Void</i> (2009)</b><br/><i>Directed by Gaspar Noé</i></p><p>“Continuing the focus on accurate, heavy post-production visual trickery, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1dy2\">Enter the Void</a></i> pops into my head. One long extended DMT (and god knows what else) mind-melting journey. I saw it on the front row of a giant cinema screen and Gaspar Noé’s visual heaven and hell never lets up. (Warning: if you do watch this on a big screen, there is an internal angle in a sex scene that you may never fully recover from but, hey, all part of the magic of the movies.)”</p><!--figure[8]--><p><b><i>21 Jump Street</i> (2012)</b><br/><i>Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller</i></p><p>“All the films so far have been a bit too serious, let’s lighten it up. The drug sequence in Lord and Miller’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/J0\">21 Jump Street</a></i> is so infectiously daft it had to make the list. The eyebrow-moustache animation speaks to me on a deep level.”</p><!--figure[9]--><p><b><i>Midsommar</i> (2019)</b><br/><i>Directed by Ari Aster</i></p><p>“On the total other side of the scale let’s include Ari Aster’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\">Midsommar</a>,</i> which reminds me why, despite making such a tripped-out film myself, I’m actually quite terrified of drugs and loss of control. There’s a beautiful visual of grass growing on hands before it all goes a bit wrong… This film is the equivalent of eating a pot brownie at a festival and thinking it’s wonderful and pretty for the first twenty minutes and then wondering why you’re just getting higher and higher and oh god when will it stop oh god this isn’t fun now and oh god why am I dressed as a bear now oh god oh god. Makes me feel a bit anxious is what I’m saying.”</p><!--figure[10]--><p><b><i>A Field in England</i> (2013)</b><br/><i>Directed by Ben Wheatley</i></p><p>“Ben Wheatley’s film <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/5tmk\">A Field in England</a> </i>was an exercise to prove to himself that he still could shoot a film in a week on a low budget (spoiler: he could). Deranged magic-mushroom hallucinations are at the heart of it and simply by using clever mirrored images, close-ups shot on a toy camera lens and nausea-inducing fast edits of dual angles of the same portrait shot, he manages to up the visual scale of what literally is a few blokes in a field, to become a deranged, seventeenth-century drug movie. A testament to how editing and sound design can make the simple feel epic.”</p><!--figure[11]--><p><b><i>The Holy Mountain</i> (1973)</b><br/><i>Directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky</i></p><p>“<a href=\"https://boxd.it/20mu\"><i>The Holy Mountain</i></a>—let’s end on this. Okay, admittedly hard to say what’s a trip in this film and what’s just a normal Wednesday afternoon in Alejandro Jodorowsky’s brain, but pretty much every frame of this film fits the bill for this list. Beautiful, bonkers, impenetrable, hairy magic.”</p>"

I attended a film class that summer and the teaching assistant had an account and encouraged all of us to create our own. I’ve been using the app religiously ever since.</p><p><b>You’re our youngest ‘How I Letterboxd’ participant to date. How would you describe your experience on Letterboxd as a teenager?<br/></b>When I was in high school, I was one of the earliest adopters of the app, so I told all of my friends about it and suggested that they use it too. By the time I got to college, it was already in the mainstream within the film community, so I was just the guy with the most extensive account. I love how Letterboxd is a community for film fans to talk about films we love, and with the exception of a few trolls every once in a while, it’s really conducive to good discussions.</p><p><b>Which features have you found the most useful?<br/></b>I’m definitely an obsessive logger. The diary feature is without a doubt my favorite part of the app. I started logging in June 2015 and have logged every feature-length film (and some shorts) I’ve watched since. I made the decision not to retroactively mark everything I’ve seen in my life as watched, because that would be too monumental a task. I also find Letterboxd particularly useful during a festival. It’s interesting to see the buzz about what movies people do and don’t like so that I can adjust my schedule accordingly.</p><p><b>And what’s a feature you wish Letterboxd had?<br/></b>I really loved when you guys changed the stars to flames for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jkPq\"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a>. It would be awesome if you started doing that more regularly for releases that get a sizeable following. Like, give <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hTha\"><i>Parasite</i></a> peaches.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>What film kicked off your passion for cinema, and specifically, which films or community of film fans motivated you to watch as many films as you can find for the current year?<br/></b>I’ve loved cinema for as long as I can remember, but the film that I credit with really birthing my love for film as art is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28No\"><i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i></a>. When I saw that in theaters at the—probably too young—age of six, I felt like [Guillermo] del Toro transported me into Ofelia’s world, and I then realized what magical capabilities the medium of film has.</p><p>As for why I’m motivated to watch so many new releases, I have a bit of an issue with saying no, haha. As a film critic, I’m inundated with requests to review movies, from major studio releases to B-movies most people have never heard of. I’ve done my fair share of adding titles to <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/\">TMDb</a>. I end up reviewing anywhere from ten to twenty new releases a week, depending on the season.</p><p><b>You’re a <a href=\"https://www.disappointmentmedia.com/\">film critic</a>, but you only post short summaries on Letterboxd instead of your full reviews. Why share only brief thoughts?<br/></b>Much of this boils down to the fact that when I watch something, it’s still under embargo for full reviews, so I can only log it in my Letterboxd diary and leave a little blurb. I also find that there isn’t as much room for humor in my full reviews, so I like using this platform to get my jokes out.</p><p><b>So, as of writing, you’ve ranked <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4ohJC\">457 films from 2020</a>. What percentage of your <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bigtunaonfilm/stats/\">total films seen</a> are from these new ‘Roaring Twenties’?<br/></b>Out of the films I’ve logged on Letterboxd, it seems like about ten percent are listed on Letterboxd as movies from 2020. The actual percentage would be quite a bit lower than that, though, since my Letterboxd doesn’t include anything I watched prior to June 2015.</p><p><b>Before Covid-19 shutdowns, how many of these films did you have the opportunity to see in theaters? Which were your most memorable theatrical experiences of the year?<br/></b>In 2020, I was able to see 29 films in theaters, either paid or in a theatrical press screening, before they shut down. I’ve also gotten to see some since the shutdown in drive-ins or from the Florida Film Festival holding socially distanced, in-person screenings. But I definitely went through a bit of theater withdrawal. I missed the smell of popcorn dearly.</p><p>For my favorite theatrical experiences in 2020, seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kWlA\"><i>The Invisible Man</i></a> on opening night with a packed crowd was definitely a hoot. I was sad at first to have missed the press screening, but like most great horror movies, it was awesome to see it with an audience and hear them gasp in surprise in the action sequences. Another one was getting to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kPxE\"><i>Weathering with You</i></a> in 4DX. Normally you wouldn’t think of that as a big, spectacle-driven 4DX movie, but it was super-immersive in all of the Sunshine Girl scenes.</p><p>And I have some awesome memories from SXSW 2019. At the world premiere of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gnV6\"><i>Us</i></a>, I was pushed into Elisabeth Moss. I once got a death stare from Elijah Wood who seemed to think I was going to approach him. Don’t get me wrong, I love his work—but I wasn’t going to because of etiquette. I watched <a href=\"https://boxd.it/grG0\"><i>Long Shot</i></a> with one of the world’s leading geneticists and then got to see Boyz II Men perform live. And I laughed hysterically when Robert Patrick said in a Q&amp;A that even he didn’t understand the movie he was in. It’s a fun time. I definitely encourage any cinephiles to attend an in-person festival when things get back to normal.</p><p><b>You have more than seventy films in your 2020 list with five or four and a half stars. Would you describe yourself as a generous rater?<br/></b>I was definitely a lot more generous when I started my Letterboxd than I am now. I’m sure if I rewatched some of those films I logged in 2015 and 2016, they’d get a lower rating today. But I really don’t mind it. I don’t see my purpose as a critic as to tear apart the filmmaker’s art—I want to appreciate it. Maybe I’m a little liberal with my five-star rating, but what can I say? Gosh, I love movies. And for me, a five-star rating doesn’t mean perfect, it means great. I don’t think there’s such thing as a perfect film. A five-star [rating] from me means that it connected with me in an extraordinary way. I reserve the ‘like’ for films that set themselves apart from the rest of the five stars by some virtue. If I give it a five and a like, now that’s something you should definitely not miss.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Your best film of 2020 so far is Amy Seimetz’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oIuG\"><i>She Dies Tomorrow</i></a>—it’s also <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5jwEm\">your number three of all time</a>. What resonated so strongly with you about the film? Are you surprised about its divisive reaction?<br/></b>I absolutely adore <i>She Dies Tomorrow</i>. I’ve really admired Amy Seimetz’s work as an actress for a long time, and her work behind the camera on this blew me away. I haven’t seen <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3j76\"><i>Sun Don’t Shine</i></a> yet, but it’s on the top of my list. It connected with me because it really captured some of the anxieties I’ve been going through recently. She obviously didn’t set out to make the definitive Covid film, but that’s what it ended up being. And of course, how could you not love that film’s extraordinary use of color. It looks magnificent. But I’m not at all surprised at how divisive it is. It has a very segmented and unorthodox narrative, and not everyone is a fan of that type of structure. I understand why it hasn’t worked as well for some people.</p><p><b>What are the other most overlooked films of 2020 so far?<br/></b>In terms of overlooked 2020 films, I think the big one is the Russell Simmons exposé <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/oijW\">On the Record</a>.</i> I think that Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/akIm\"><i>The Hunting Ground</i></a> is one of the most harrowing documentaries I have ever seen in my life, and <i>On the Record</i> combines a lot of that relevance while also offering a really compelling look at the life of a powerful woman in the music industry. It’s great, and only about one thousand members have logged it on Letterboxd. Watch it on HBO Max!</p><p>There are a lot of great movies released in 2020 that are widely available and [fewer than] 5,000 people having logged them on Letterboxd. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lZWQ\"><i>A White, White Day</i></a> is a great little revenge thriller from Iceland. But what makes it stand out from the genre is that it’s a lot more understated and character-driven than most. It has similar vibes to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dWOS\"><i>You Were Never Really Here</i></a>, but perhaps even quieter. Maria von Hausswolff’s cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, and Ingvar Sigurðsson gives one of my favorite performances of the year. It’s just a gorgeous film.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/h8u2\">The Painted Bird</a></i> is a bit harder to recommend because it is by no means fun, but it’s one of those that you have to watch once and will never want to see again. I described it as “auteur shock cinema”. It’s a three-hour-long Holocaust drama that’s bleak and filled with torture, but it’s powerful, heartbreaking and harrowing. It also features great performances all around, especially from child actor Peta Kotlár.</p><p>I think Michael Winterbottom is one of the best directors working right now and I’ve always loved what he did with the Coogan-Brydon combo in his <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-trip-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>The Trip</i> series</a>, and this year’s entry, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mAde\"><i>The Trip to Greece</i></a>, is probably the best one yet. Over the course of the decade the series has spanned, Coogan and Brydon have changed a lot, and this series—in which they play themselves—has adapted to reflect that. This one’s a lot more heartfelt, but still features plenty of great impressions and tantalizing food shots. This really is one of my favorite film series of all time, so you should check all four out! Some other overlooked films I can think of are <a href=\"https://boxd.it/olRC\"><i>Jasper Mall</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/plqe\"><i>Aviva</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/k1k6\"><i>Sword of God</i></a>.</p><p><b>Which 2020 films would you say are the most overrated? Any absolute must-avoids?<br/></b>This is going to be a really hot take, but there was a trifecta of homebound horror flicks that came out in July—<a href=\"https://boxd.it/jEwS\"><i>Relic</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lCQ6\"><i>The Rental</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oikq\"><i>Amulet</i></a>—and I didn’t care for any of them. I think all the directors are talented and show a lot of potential, especially Natalie Erika James, but I wasn’t a fan of any of the films. As for ones to avoid, I try not to call out bad movies unless there’s a reason to [do so], and there are only two of those this year: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mKF8\"><i>Coffee &amp; Kareem</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/qIgS\"><i>Elvis from Outer Space</i></a>. <i>Coffee &amp; Kareem</i> is just offensive, and <i>Elvis from Outer Space</i> tries to be so-bad-it’s-funny and falls flat.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>What films that you’ve been fortunate to preview via screeners or film festivals are you certain will be a big deal once they’re available on general release?<br/></b>Ugh, there are some I wish I could talk about but I’m still under embargo! So I’ll have to talk mostly about festival ones. Alice Gu’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/p9l2\"><i>The Donut King</i></a> is wonderful. It was supposed to debut at SXSW, but obviously that got cancelled. On one hand, it is a food doc about donuts—who doesn’t love donuts?—but it’s also a moving story about the immigrant experience. It scored distribution from Greenwich and should be released soon. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kbUS\"><i>Charm City Kings</i></a> is great, and HBO Max picked that up to be released sometime this year. That’s a really awesome coming-of-age movie with a story by Barry Jenkins. And I saw a work-in-progress cut of this indie called <a href=\"https://boxd.it/o9sg\"><i>Millennium Bugs</i></a> made by an up-and-comer named Alejandro Montoya Marín. He was part of the Robert Rodriguez show <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7827546/\"><i>Rebel Without a Crew</i></a>. It’s a great little movie about Y2K and the Latinx experience that will be debuting online at Dances with Films and is looking for a distributor after that.</p><p><b>Fill in the blank: “2020 is a great year for ____ in film”. What patterns have you noticed?<br/></b>I really think that 2020 is a great year for documentaries. We thought 2018 was a great year with <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hDPU\"><i>Won’t You Be My Neighbor?</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iEEq\"><i>Free Solo</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hLS8\"><i>RBG</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hDNO\"><i>Three Identical Strangers</i></a>, among others, but this year is shaping up to be even better. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiNW\"><i>Boys State</i></a>, <i>The Donut King</i>, <i>On the Record</i>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiR0\"><i>Rebuilding Paradise</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/pt54\"><i>Dark City Beneath the Beat</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/pE6i\"><i>A Secret Love</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oijM\"><i>Disclosure</i></a> are all excellent, and that’s just scratching the surface.</p><p>I think what makes these documentaries stand out is their ability to make the viewer feel connected to their story. I love documentaries that take a story you might not have otherwise heard of and tell it in a way that feels intensely personal. By taking these stories like the problems inherent in American democracy, the immigrant experience, the California wildfires, the #MeToo movement, and issues with trans representation on screen and telling them in a way that people can relate to them even if they can’t personally identify with their subjects, these documentary filmmakers are making the world a more compassionate place.</p><p><b>What films are you most looking forward to that are scheduled to release in 2020? Any awards season predictions you feel strongly about?<br/></b>In terms of mainstream releases, I’m most excited for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/cPX2\"><i>No Time to Die</i></a>, unless it gets pushed to 2021 like some have rumored. I’m a huge Cary Joji Fukunaga fan, so I’m excited to see what he does with the franchise. For indies, I’m really looking forward to seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/loRE\"><i>Promising Young Woman</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kuy2\"><i>The Green Knight</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oifU\"><i>Save Yourselves!</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnRy\"><i>Nomadland</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lkba\"><i>Another Round</i></a>. </p><p>For awards seasons predictions, there are a few I’m pretty confident about based on what I’ve seen. <i>Boys State</i> is an early frontrunner for Best Documentary. I think Eliza Hittman will get some love for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lWJk\"><i>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</i></a>. Dev Patel is a pretty good bet for a Best Actor nod for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iTAS\"><i>The Personal History of David Copperfield</i></a>, even though the movie itself probably won’t get much more love. And there’s an upcoming Netflix movie that has a screenplay nomination in the bag, and maybe a couple other categories too, but shhhh, I’m under embargo on that one so I can’t say more.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>You keep thorough distributor rankings as well as year and franchise lists—how would you sum up the way each of these recently formed companies inspires you?<br/></b>Obviously <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2RW2k\">A24</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ZlwI\">NEON</a> have amassed a pretty big cult following, and for good reason. There’s a particular identity their films have, despite the differences in genre, and I enjoy ranking them because of that. For the streamers, their films are a little more diverse, but I use my lists as a way for people to discover some of my favorite films they can watch at the click of a button. And for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ZAjk\">Blumhouse</a>, it’s just because I absolutely adore the work Jason Blum does in supporting filmmakers’ voices. I’m usually pretty cool-headed around celebrities because interacting with high-profile people is a part of our job as critics, but I admittedly froze when I met him at SXSW since I’m such a big fan of his. I’ve always said that once I score an interview with him, I can “retire” as a critic, haha.</p><p><b>You’re of Guatemalan descent. Which films do you best relate with your <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5SP5A\">Latino heritage</a>?<br/></b>Of course, <i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i> is a big deal for me given the fact that it was a formative film in my life. [Alejandro] Jodorowsky’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20mu\"><i>The Holy Mountain</i></a> is one of my favorite Latino classics. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YRq\"><i>El Mariachi</i></a> is great because Robert Rodriguez is the epitome of Latino DIY filmmaking and has always been such an inspiring figure. I got to <a href=\"https://popaxiom.com/popaxiom-talks-with-robert-rodriguez-and-jon-landau-about-alita-battle-angel/\">interview him</a> last year for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/e0rS\"><i>Alita: Battle Angel</i></a>, and it was an awesome experience. And in terms of more recent films, I think the Netflix doc <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oiPo\"><i>Mucho Mucho Amor</i></a> really captures the importance of community amongst Latinos.</p><p><b>What films are highest on your list of shame?<br/></b>I will say that I’ve seen more classics than I have logged on Letterboxd, but there are still a few embarrassing gaps on my list. I love the work I’ve seen from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/akira-kurosawa/\">Akira Kurosawa</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/brian-de-palma/\">Brian De Palma</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/agnes-varda/\">Agnès Varda</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/chantal-akerman/\">Chantal Akerman</a>, and I really want to finish up their filmographies. Probably the most shameful omission I have is the fact that I’ve never seen a film by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ingmar-bergman/\">Ingmar Bergman</a>. I’ve been lightening my workload for my site a bit, so I’m hoping to catch up on some of those soon.</p><p><b>Who are three Letterboxd members you recommend we follow?<br/></b>My friend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/camdenferrell/\">Camden Ferrell</a> who co-founded disappointment media with me. He’s also very passionate about film and does a lot of reviews for the site. Another one of our contributors is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dselwyns/\">Sarah</a>, who came on to the team during Sundance this year. She’s great and basically started the <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> fandom. I also want to give a shout-out to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/berkreviews/\">Jon Berk</a> who was actually the critic to challenge me to start a blog back in 2016 when he was doing the Doug Loves Movies challenge, and now I’ve gotten to where I significantly outpace him, haha.</p>"

The first project that I wrote was a $90-million movie that Sev and I wrote. ‘Why did we do this?!’”</p><p><b></b>Chaganty also stresses the need to ensure your project <i>wants </i>to be a limited-setting story. “A lot of times I’ll read a found-footage script and it will often feel like all it wants to be is a <i>not</i> a found-footage script. There’s a lot of times where it feels like the writers don’t want it to be that.”</p><p><h2>Explore the whole box. </h2></p><p>Chaganty encourages aspiring writers to imagine your limited environment as a box. “You’re writing within this box, all the characters are in this box, I think the best way to examine it is not to ever try leaving the box, but make sure you explore it every which way. The box upside down, the box right side up, the box left, the box right…</p><p>“This is an objective that should apply to all films, but it’s easier to objectively analyze whether you’re doing it in a limited setting. With a film like <i>Searching</i>, we have to make sure that every possible iteration of how a narrative can take place on a computer screen is done. Looking at a movie like <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1tXC\">Buried</a></i>, they’re doing every possible iteration of how that story can be told underground, in a coffin, before [the location] starts to change.”</p><p>(Good news for fans of <i>Searching</i>: with new tech platforms appearing all the time, it turns out there are more parts of the box to explore. A sequel is in the works, but Chaganty won’t be in the director’s chair.)</p><p><h2>Give yourselves a deadline.</h2></p><p>With no end to the pandemic in sight, it’s easy for one day to melt into the next. Keep your team motivated with a deadline. “I gave us two weeks,” says Rob Savage, <i>Host</i>’s<i> </i>director, who co-wrote the film with Jed Shepherd and Gemma Hurley, after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dirrobsavage/status/1252635448440225795?lang=en\">his Twitter prank went viral</a>.</p><p>“So we had two weeks, all three of us, to come together,” adds Hurley. “Let’s figure out a structure, let’s figure out these character dynamics, figure out a way to build tension around this idea of a séance and hang a story and a journey for the characters, for where we want the séance to end up. We had a Google doc where we were editing it together. I’d go away and do my pass, Rob would go away and do his pass, and Jed would. And that was it. It was really just like, run and gun, go go go.”<br/></p><p>“If things had gone to plan we would have had this out in two months; in the end it took three,” Savage continues. ”It took twelve weeks from when I first called Jed up and said ‘let’s make a feature’, to delivering the movie—roughly breaks up as two weeks of writing, we shot for three weeks, and then a lot of editing and VFX time.”</p><p><h2>Know your story inside-out, but don’t labor the script.</h2></p><p>“We’ve got some hearts to break, here,” warns Hurley. “There was no official script in the standard way because there just wasn’t time. The whole point was capturing a zeitgeist moment… If we went away and wrote a feature-film script, well, ‘we’ll see you after the pandemic’s over, guys!’. You’d miss that moment. That was the joy of it. You didn’t have time to labor over every syllable.”</p><p>Some of <i>Host</i>’s key moments were scripted, Hurley reassures. “We had lines we wanted them to suggest, but more than giving them dialog it was about giving them prompts for every scene.”<br/></p><p>Savage adds: “The thing that we did really well, at the end of the two weeks of writing, is every single scene, me, Jed and Gemma, you could quiz us all in separate interrogation rooms, we’d be able to tell you the purpose of every scene and what we wanted to get out of them. We had the movie so clearly in our heads in terms of how we wanted it to feel.”</p><p>An advantage of having a treatment rather than a completed script? “A sense of discovery every day,” says Savage. “The actors just brought that amazing spontaneity to it and these incredible performances, because we knew the parameters.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--><h2>Choosing your camera (spoiler: it’s not your laptop’s).</h2></p><p>“John is acting against a black screen,” Chaganty reveals. “There’s nothing on his computer, he’s literally looking at nothing.” To ensure complete control over their footage while preserving authentic eyelines, both sets of filmmakers taped additional cameras to the laptops of their key talent. In <i>Host</i>, each of the Zoom participants had iPhones recording at their highest resolution “so we knew we were getting a clean 1080p,” says Savage. In <i>Searching</i>’s case, it was a GoPro taped to the rear of the various computers used by John Cho.</p><p>“Before we started shooting the film,” Chaganty explains, “we had to make [an animatic] version using Adobe Premiere, because much of John’s performance is knowing his eyeline. He needs to know exactly where the iMessages open up—in order for us to know that we almost have to know those decisions already.” Chaganty and his team developed a 100-minute animatic cut, with Chaganty playing every role; “understanding where every window is, where every cursor is, so that by the time we get to set, what I’m doing is showing John ‘okay, this is where that message pops up, and while you’re talking to Deborah, you’re going to look over there, go down there, open Chrome, type in…’ So everything is very specific eyelines. Sometimes my notes after a take would just be ‘John that was great, just move the cursor a little further to the left this time’.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--><h2>Develop your characters and the genre will take care of itself.</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p>Chaganty and the <i>Host </i>team have the same advice for how to ratchet up the tension in a limited-setting film: it’s all about character.<i> </i>“If you’re going to end up putting these characters through tough times and potentially kill them,” says Shepherd, “develop them as real characters, so that we care about them.”<br/></p><p>Although <i>Host</i>’s script was, in fact, only a seventeen-page beat-sheet, the most important part of its structure was the long stretch up front where the characters are dialling into the call and catching up—what Shepherd calls the “getting to know you bit”. “That first part is really important because if it wasn’t for that, the third act wouldn’t work at all. The best thing to do is make your characters real, authentic, believable. Everything else takes care of itself.”</p><p>Chaganty agrees: “When you are writing something that is genre, your other decisions don’t have to be genre, and in fact it might elevate it more when you don’t do that, because everything else is already doing that, you know?”</p><p>In particular, he advises, trust your talent to lean into their characters, rather than into the genre. “This was my challenge at least, as a totally amateur director: sometimes what I was looking for was the most obvious take as opposed to the most subtle take. “When we left the shoot I was thinking it was take six, or the one where it was most obvious [John] was angry or he was sad or something—and what we ended up using was the most subtle takes. That subtlety, that underneath layer, so much of that was him. He’s so good. He’s so good. I hate to say it, but I didn’t realize how good he was until we edited it together.”</p><p><!--figure[4]--><h2>Spend time getting the interface right. </h2></p><p><i>“There’s not a frame of Zoom footage in the actual movie.”—Rob Savage</i><br/></p><p>Found-footage films and browser horrors rely on the believability of the content. <i>Searching </i>and <i>Host </i>work because the footage <i>feels real</i>, even though the reality is there are multiple takes and a lot of post-production. Just as <i>Searching</i> was built around a detailed animatic, <i>Host </i>is, in fact, not a recorded Zoom call, but a result of three weeks of filming every actor in multiple takes, with stunt set-ups, followed by the addition of VFX and Zoom interface details. </p><p>“Originally the plan was just to screen-record a Zoom call, but then we realized that we were pumping so much money into doing these crazy stunts and effects that we could blow half the budget in 30 seconds,” says Savage. “You’re basically making five movies. We have to make sure the performances are all tight in every single screen. Radina might be amazing in take one and Jemma might nail it in take three and we have to cut them all together so they work seamlessly.”</p><p>Savage praises <i>Host </i>editor Brenna Rangott for pulling it all together, underscoring the importance of post-production in your budget and schedule. “Honestly, what Brenna did with all this footage? It’s her movie as much as it’s anyone else’s movie. She absolutely smashed it.”</p><p>The <i>Host </i>crew also relied on fellow filmmaker and designer Dan Hawkins to build the almost 4,000 individual assets in the film, and producer Douglas Cox, who went through the whole movie to type out every single name, label and other Zoom interface detail. “4,000 times he had to do that, and that’s what you see to make it play seamlessly.” (And, yes, they had Zoom’s permission.)</p><p><!--figure[5]--><h2>Trust your gut.</h2></p><p>The <i>Host</i> team were pursued for a feature-length version of Savage’s Twitter prank by a “mind-blowing” number of studios—“it was a really competitive situation,” says Savage—but they went with Shudder for one reason: instinct.</p><p>“It was the height of the lockdown and a lot of production companies just started ringing and saying ‘Is there a longer version of this? Because it’s the only thing we can shoot right now’. So we pitched to a bunch of places, and the pitch was basically ‘a Zoom séance, we don’t know if it’s going to be any good, we’re going to use our mates, are you in or not?’ and Shudder [was] like ‘of course we are’.”</p><p>It wasn’t about the money. Some companies offered more generous budgets, but wanted to release six to eight months after filming. “We were like, ‘no, this needs to be out this week’.”</p><p><h2>Move away from the wall.</h2></p><p>Since so much of the movie business—all those endless meetings—has pivoted to video-calls, we asked the filmmakers for specific advice on how to present yourself online, in pitch meetings, table reads and the like.</p><p>The very minimum, they all agree, is to have good lighting. “It’s crazy what a difference a desk lamp can make to your environment,” says Chaganty. And move away from the wall. “Rule number one any director of photography will ever say, is don’t shoot at a wall,” he adds. “The further that you can place yourself from that wall, it’s just going to look better.” (It also gives you more protection from any demons that may burst from cupboards during your Zoom, <i>Host</i>’s filmmakers advise<i>.</i>)</p><p>Chaganty reveals that the pandemic has actually helped his pitching abilities in video meetings with executives. Chaganty and Ohanian are currently developing a heist movie, while simultaneously pitching a television show. “Right now pitches are all digital. Traditionally when you pitch something, it’s a lot of material and you just memorize it. But now, you can have your script with you—but you can’t make it seem like you’re reading off a screen.” The trick, he says, is to re-size the window of the person you’re pitching to, and re-size the script to the same dimensions, then place them directly over each other. </p><p>“So you’re reading and your eyeline is exactly where they are, and then you switch over, and they’ll never know and you’ve just pulled it off perfectly because you’re still looking at the exact same spot. It just kind of feels like an incredible performance where you’ve pulled these great words out of your mind and your heart, without anyone knowing.”<br/></p><p>On the other hand, don’t put too much effort into details that nobody will notice. “We were doing a table read for a film,” says<i> Host</i>’s Shepherd, “and I thought it would be fun to change the background to correspond with what scene were were reading. I thought it was really clever but nobody noticed except me.”</p><p><!--figure[6]--><h2>There’s no time like the present.</h2></p><p>“When digital cameras came out, everyone started saying ‘this is a great thing for filmmakers because it really democratizes filmmaking’,” says Chaganty. “We are in a very small bubble where it’s even more democratized than it was before—that’s because everybody has the same resources that we do right now.</p><p>“It feels like John Oliver and Hasan Minhaj and Trevor Noah are all making stuff with the same quality that you can make, that I can make, just in our own houses right now. The longer this pandemic goes on, and the longer that it feels that Hollywood can’t make traditional stuff the way it used to, the more likely it is that the demand for content is going to rise.</p><p>“If you can make something good in this time, I think you’re in a really good spot as far as getting eyeballs on it. And eyeballs essentially are the things that can propel a career to the next stage.”</p><p>Plus, there are mental health benefits to making movies together, at a time when we are all being urged to stay socially connected while physically distant. “What’s been really nice about the whole thing is it just made it so clear how collaborative a process filmmaking is,” says Savage. “Normally people kind of forget about that and you have ‘a film by’, but here you had to put so much trust in everyone. It was just a really fun way of working. I recommend it to everyone.”<br/></p>"

      "body": "<p>If <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kris-rey/\">Kris Rey</a>’s new comedy <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oIva\"><i>I Used to Go Here</i></a> were a typical Hollywood rom-com, it would finish just before Rey’s film starts: with Kate Conklin (Gillian Jacobs) as a newly published author, engaged to be married to a handsome guy.

It runs in opposition to the happy endings Hollywood has made us expect.<br/></b><i>Kris Rey:</i> Oh god, [that’s] so astute. No-one has said that before and I have never thought of it before, but that’s so true! I think what’s so interesting about the whole journey that she goes on, and all of our own personal journeys, is that you’re used to, like, at the end of the movie, they get married! She gets her book published! And then everything is perfect! And then you realize: ‘Oh. Oh god, okay. How do I move on from this?’ So, you’re right, that is what’s so different about this.</p><p><b>The other thing—and I’m sure this can be said about most films this year—is how the set-up feels weirdly right for these times, which is to say: the widespread derailment of plans that the pandemic has wrought. <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/625097211660926976/survival-mode\">It’s like we’re in a strange global coming-of-age</a>. Several Letterboxd reviews <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hxEV9\">observe</a> how, for women in their late twenties to early thirties, there’s a second coming-of-age where everything suddenly feels extremely nostalgic. The film dives into that longing feeling by literally returning Kate to her old college.<br/></b>It’s funny, you know, a lot of people have pointed out how this doesn’t quite fit into a category. It’s not a rom-com, it’s not a true coming-of-age film in a sense of what we know that to be. I think that part of it is exactly what you’ve just pointed out, which is that it’s about a unique period of time for women, where you do reach this precipice. Mostly, it comes out of this big ever-pressing question which is “Am I going to have a family or not?”. Not every woman, but most women, have that question in their head until they either have a baby or they reach the age where they can’t have a baby anymore. “Am I going to have this? Am I going to follow this path of domesticity? Am I going to find a relationship that works long enough to have a family with them? Am I going to have to make sacrifices in my career to make room to have a family? Am I going to find them all at once?” Men just don’t have that point, to no fault of their own, but the fault of the patriarchy in general, which is that it has to be a conscious decision for women in a way that everything revolves around that, as we go about our lives at that age.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>And you’ve explored that idea <a href=\"https://boxd.it/9LTE\">in more than just this film</a>. I loved the awkward-yet-sincere moment at the baby shower, when the friends make her hold her book alongside their third-trimester bumps for a group photo. A book is a baby, and its publication should also be celebrated! Scenes like that emphasize how well Gillian Jacobs embraced the role of Kate. What did she bring to it that wasn’t on the page?</b><br/>There’s such a special thing that happens when you cast anyone for anything. It certainly happened with Gillian, but also with everyone. Definitely Jemaine was a big one, which is that I don’t typically write for specific actors. I write a character, I write the dialog, and then when I cast them I think ‘oh, Jemaine Clement is going to be in this role’, so then I go back through and read the whole thing in his voice and think ‘maybe he’d say it like this instead’ and maybe after [a scene we don’t wish to spoil], he would make tea for everyone. Very few, if any, American actors would be able to pull that moment off. That is kind of what I’m looking for: who are they? Are they able to feel like real people? Because so often they feel performative.</p><p><b>Like versions of a person.<br/></b>Right. Like they’re <i>acting</i> like a person! Gillian is very authentic. If you were to talk to her, she would just seem like her real self, and that was what was so appealing about her for me. Gillian just really brought herself, and I learned about her as a person.</p><p><b>As well as great comics like Kate Micucci and Jorma Taccone, there’s a lovely assortment of inclusive young characters who live in Kate’s old student house. Where did you find them?<br/></b>I just flushed them out and gathered them and held them close! There’s a couple of them that I didn’t know but I had seen in other stuff. Josh Wiggins, who plays Hugo, I’d seen him act in a movie called <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7bli\"><i>Hellion</i></a>. Forrest Goodluck I saw in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/f6B2\"><i>The Miseducation of Cameron Post</i></a>. He’s incredible in that and I knew I wanted him to play Animal. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/hannah-marks/\">Hannah Marks</a> was someone that was sent to me, and we talked on the phone and I just knew she would be perfect. She’s such a brilliant go-getter and filmmaker and so ambitious in her own life. Khloe Janel, who plays Emma, auditioned for me here in Chicago and she’s so good. I adore her. I was taking a walk yesterday through the neighborhood and I saw her name on a little sign—she was making these poetry zines! I bought one.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>The person we need to know about is whoever the guy is who plays Tall Brandon!<br/></b>Brandon Daley, who plays tall Brandon, is a person that I just knew. He is on the periphery of my social circle and he had come to a few parties at my house. His buddies called him ‘Tall Brandon’, in this very demeaning way! They were of course all good friends. I thought he was such a funny character that I wrote the character based on him. But I didn’t know him. Then he heard that I had written a part called Tall Brandon and he asked if he could play the part. I was like, “I don’t think so, Brandon!”</p><p><b>Was he an actor?<br/></b>Kind of. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/brandon-daley/\">He’s a filmmaker</a> but he’s much younger than me and he hadn’t done anything besides his own work. But I made him audition for the role based on him! [Laughs] I don’t know, I was just like, it’s a huge role, you know? The last thing you want is someone who can’t act like themselves, which everyone struggles to do. Anyway, he was so good in the audition, so funny, and he just nailed it. He steals the whole movie! He’s just so good.</p><p><b><i>I Used to Go Here</i> is a long way from problematic college fare like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ORq\"><i>Revenge of the Nerds</i></a> or the angst of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TyS\"><i>St Elmo’s Fire</i></a>. It feels thoroughly 21st-century, especially in how the Gen Z housemates take an inclusive, ‘sure, why not’ approach to having Kate tag along with them. What inspired the way you wrote the intergenerational aspects of the film?<br/></b>There weren’t necessarily college films that I was using for inspiration. I wanted the place to feel the same that she left, but I wanted the people to feel different. This is what I’m finding in my life. I’m gonna turn 40 this year, and when I interact with people in their twenties, I’m blown away by the way that they view the world and the way that they view themselves and each other. I’m so impressed by it. And I am on board with a lot of these cultural changes that we’re seeing happen before our eyes, like, the idea of gender identity has changed so much, and so quickly. I’ve never seen anything change like that in my life. The idea of consent. When I first heard it I was like, “What? You have to ask if you wanna touch someone or kiss someone? It seems so lame!” Now, I can’t believe that we ever did that! I’m learning so much. They seem so clear-headed about it all. I just think that we have a lot to learn from that generation.</p><p>The movie’s not about <i>that</i>, necessarily, but it’s infused into it and I wanted that to influence Kate, in her life. Some of it is specific to this generation, but some of it is also just specific to being in your twenties. The character April, the way that she thinks about the [publishing] industry and her art, and the way that Kate, who is jaded, is like, “Okay, whatever, you’re naïve, make your little magazine, but you’ll have to follow the rules.” We’ve all been faced with that before.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>So it’s a watershed year for you, turning 40. What would you define success and happiness as now, compared to when you were in your twenties and the ideas you had about the industry then?<br/></b>Oh, god. Okay so I’ve also had a lot of personal growth because I got divorced this last year, which was crazy. I’ve got two kids, a four year old and a nine year old. So I’ve been through so much; it’s been such a huge change for me. I have learned a lot, but one of the things that I have learned so much is that the relationships that matter the most in my life are my female friendships. I’ve always known that, but I’ve never seen it so much as I have in the last two years, both personally throughout my divorce, and professionally through making a film without a romantic partner to lean on. Of course I have male friends that are wonderful and supportive, but my female friends, those relationships are where I’m realizing I wanna put my effort into more than any other part of my life.</p><p><b>Okay, it’s time for a few questions about movies that are important to you. Thinking back, what is the film that made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/23um\"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a> was the first film that I watched when I was in high school that I thought ‘oh, this is a job, and I’m seeing someone make stylistic choices that are interesting and unique’. You can see the behind the scenes in that movie a little bit. I remember watching it and thinking ‘that would be a cool job’. I also really loved the movie <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1PDa\"><i>Bottle Rocket</i></a> in high school. I began my filmmaking career thinking that I wanted to make documentaries, and so there’s also a lot of docs that I loved. But those were the early films that made me realize that it was even a job. Unfortunately not any female filmmakers, because I think that was just so rare [then].</p><p><b>What is your all-time comfort favorite film?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29re\"><i>Sleepless in Seattle</i></a>, no question.</p><p><b>There’s your female filmmaker!<br/></b>Yes, but with a movie like <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>, it’s such a mainstream movie that I never thought of it as ‘a job’. It wasn’t until I was in high school that I saw more independent and auteurish works. But Nora Ephron is a genius. That movie is perfect in my opinion.</p><p><b>What’s a film that, as a teenager, felt like a mirror into your soul?<br/></b>That movie with Chris O’Donnell, an Irish film, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Aho\"><i>Circle of Friends</i></a>. With Minnie Driver! Who is also in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ahY\"><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a>, another film I saw in high school. I haven’t seen <i>Circle of Friends</i> since it came out, but it felt very real to me, that movie. I don’t think I’ve ever mentioned that movie to anyone!</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>What is the sexiest film you’ve ever seen?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/27Pe\"><i>Shakespeare in Love</i></a>! [Laughs.] There’s two movies. One was <a href=\"https://boxd.it/24ho\"><i>Legends of the Fall</i></a>. It was literally the sexiest movie I’d ever seen up till that point. I was very young when it came out and there was this lovemaking scene by candlelight and I was like, ‘oh, that’s what <i>sex</i> is!’. And then <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>. That scene where he’s unwrapping her? So hot.</p><p><b>Who is another director you’d die for?<br/></b>I’m such a huge fan of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nicole-holofcener/\">Nicole Holofcener</a>. I love her films so much. I have never met her. I do know some people that know her and I am honestly so scared to meet her because I like her work so much. She’s probably my favorite filmmaker. I just vibe with everything she makes. I love the tone. I just love all of her movies.</p><p><b>What’s a film that we should watch after we watch yours?<br/></b>You should watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oIuG\"><i>She Dies Tomorrow</i></a>. It’s so good, and Amy Seimetz is my very, very close and dear friend. We started making movies at the same time. Our movies were supposed to premiere at SXSW on the same day, and now they are being released on the same day, and we’re just in love with each other. Amy and I are— the movies are so wildly different from each other, but her movie is so good. It is really funny, it’s really weird and it’s really appropriate for the times right now.</p><p><b>I feel like some reviews are missing the comedy in it.<br/></b>I laughed so much throughout that film. I agree: people don’t get it! Can I shout out another movie that I watched recently? <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1rTS\"><i>Crossing Delancey</i></a>. I had never seen it before and my sister-in-law texted me and she was like, “you should watch this film like right now—this seems like something you would love”. I couldn’t believe how good it was. It’s so great. It feels like it could be shot right now in Brooklyn. All the cool kids in Brooklyn are dressing exactly the same way that all the cool kids in Brooklyn dressed in 1988, or whenever it came out. She’s having a dialog with a friend and the friend is like openly breastfeeding. And the way that they’re talking about romance and all this stuff is so on point. That movie’s great.</p><p><b>And another female director! Joan Micklin Silver.<br/></b>Yeah!</p>"

The alternatives, of just having throat-stomping scenes one after another, feels to me like an evening at the feelies.”</p>><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/379352025?color=40BCF4&amp;portrait=false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe<p>To be clear, <i>Come and See</i> isn’t some underrated, recently unearthed discovery. It was released in the United States in 1987 and officially submitted as the Soviet entry into the Foreign Language Film category of the 58th Academy Awards. It’s been featured on Roger Ebert’s “Great Movies” series, and best-of lists from <i>Empire</i> and <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i> magazines.</p><p>In Hollywood, the likes of Steven Soderbergh and Roger Deakins have been vocal in their praise of Klimov’s film. “What I saw will stay with me forever; it is a masterpiece not only of filmmaking, but of humanity itself,” Sean Penn once said. Films such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-thin-red-line/\"><i>The Thin Red Line</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/schindlers-list/\"><i>Schindler’s List</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/saving-private-ryan/\"><i>Saving Private Ryan</i></a> all owe a little something to <i>Come and See</i> in their respective cinematic representations of WWII.</p><p>But as we’ve seen in the <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/622440787795410944/ghibli-goes-digital\">recent surge of Studio Ghibli</a> viewing—and with Soderbergh’s <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/613161636990205952/the-curve-contagion\"><i>Contagion</i> back in March</a>—it’s sensible to hypothesize that the combination of increased media availability and a tumultuous socio-political atmosphere can contribute to the most dramatic of Letterboxd activity spikes.</p><p>Our data shows a clear correlation between <i>Come and See</i> diary entries and screenings of the stunning Janus Films 2K restoration that appeared in select theaters earlier this year—a big spike, in particular, after the screening at New York’s Film Forum on February 21. And Criterion Collection’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31fwtbi\">DVD</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3a4boVd\">Blu-ray</a> and <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/come-and-see\">digital release</a>—a true revelation for those who’ve only ever watched the film via the 2003 Kino Lorber DVD—has positively pushed the film into the stratosphere, with a huge jump in numbers in late June, and holding steady ever since.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b></b></p><p>Given present circumstances—an out-of-control global pandemic with no discernible end in sight; Nazi sentiment and systemic racism still thriving in plain sight—<i>Come and See</i>’s petrifying apocalyptic wallop may not exactly be comfort viewing, but it does serve as a sobering, industrial-strength reminder that this is definitely not <i>The Good Place</i> and we should be concerned. As <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/punchdrunklizzy/film/come-and-see/\">Lizzy asks</a> in her ominous review, “What urges could turn men into such beasts?”</p><p>The film’s original title is the agreeably pointed <i>Kill Hitler</i> (“I think that’s beautiful” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/murielcampos/film/come-and-see/\">Muriel</a>). But its current beckoning, lifted from the Book of Revelation, is the more provocatively accessible invitation of the two: once you come and see, you can’t unsee <i>Come and See</i>.</p>"

The list—<i>Jezebel</i>, <i>Beats</i>, <i>Zombi Child</i>, <i>Blinded by the Light</i>, <i>Selah and the Spades</i>, <i>The Half of It</i>, <i>Dating Amber</i>, <i>Babyteeth</i>, <i>House of Hummingbird</i> and <i>We Are Little Zombies</i>—is by no means exhaustive. But it allows us to look at several things.</p><p>Firstly, that the genre is thriving, considering these titles barely scratch the surface. Secondly, these ten films look a whole lot different than their 1980s counterparts. Six are directed by women. Four tell queer stories or, at least, feature queer characters in a prominent subplot. Seven tell stories about Black people, Asian people, Pakistani people. Only three are from the US.</p><p>And: they’re really good. They understand teenagers as angry, energetic, passionate, confused, desperate and deeply intelligent beings, echoing the nuances that we know to be true in real life, but that can often get watered down on the screen.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jrYO\"><i>Blinded by the Light</i></a></b> <i>(co-written and directed by Gurinder Chadha)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kIp4\"><i>We Are Little Zombies</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by Makoto Nagahisa)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/hMig\"><i>Beats</i></a></b> <i>(co-written and directed by Brian Welsh)</i></p><p>The protagonists in these first three films use music to feel their way through panic, brought on by both internal and external circumstances. Screaming another’s lyrics, furiously composing their own anthems, dancing along and sweating out their fear to the beat, the ongoing beat, and nothing more. It’s salvation, it’s release—when you’re left with your own thoughts, the only way to fight through them is to drown them out.</p><p>Music acts as a source of enlightenment in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jrYO\"><i>Blinded by the Light</i></a>, directed by Gurinder Chadha (who made 2002’s coming-of-age sports banger <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2am0\"><i>Bend it Like Beckham</i></a>). In Thatcher’s Britain, Pakistani-English Muslim high schooler Javed discovers the music of Bruce Springsteen, and his world bursts wide open. The wisdom and fire of the Boss helps Javed to make sense of his own frustrations; that the film is based on a real journalist’s autobiography makes it all the more potent.</p><p>Meanwhile, in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hMig\"><i>Beats</i></a>, a real-life law enacted in Scotland in the 1990s temporarily banned raves: specifically, the gathering of people around music “wholly or predominantly characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. As the UK struggles to contain a youthful, exuberant new counter-culture, the central characters face what it means to enter adulthood. The answer to both: a forbidden rave.</p><p>“I have to say, there’s probably no such thing as teenagers without complicated emotions,” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kIp4\"><i>We Are Little Zombies</i></a> writer-director Makoto Nagahisa tells me. The Japanese filmmaker—<a href=\"https://boxd.it/7cYtq\">who loves the genre, known as ‘Seishun eiga’ in Japan</a>—wrestles with the frustration and hopelessness of the world by giving his film’s four orphaned teens the tools, and the permission, to find solace in something other than their everyday life. Following the deaths of their parents, the quartet create their own catchy, cathartic, truth-bomb music; it’s an instant hit with kids across Japan, but the adults miss the point, of course—that the cacophony of superstardom is filling the silence of their mourning.</p><p>Nagahisa-san’s film is named after a fictional 8-bit Nintendo Game Boy game that the main character is addicted to. “I used to get through my day relatively painlessly by pretending I was a video game character whenever bad shit happened to me,” he explains. Teenagers “are constantly feeling crushed by reality right now… I want them to know that this is a valid way to escape reality. That reality is just a ‘game’. I want them to know they don’t need to face tragedies, they can just survive. That’s the most important thing!” Who else needed to hear that right now?</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lbdm\"><i>Jezebel</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by Numa Perrier)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kgkq\"><i>Zombi Child</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by Bertrand Bonello)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jPxW\"><i>Selah and the Spades</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by Tayarisha Poe)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jZ8C\"><i>House of Hummingbird</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by Kim Bo-ra)</i></p><p>Our next four films turn to technology, mythology, hierarchy and education to animate their protagonists’ lives with a greater purpose. In <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lbdm\"><i>Jezebel</i></a>, nineteen-year-old Tiffany finds her way through mourning with a new job, earning money as a cam girl and subsequently developing a bond with one of her clients. There’s a magnetic aura, one that harnesses grief and turns it into something more corrosive as this teen puts all her energy into it. Similarly there’s mysticism in the air in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kgkq\"><i>Zombi Child</i></a>, in which Haitian voodoo gives a bored, heartbroken teenage girl a new purpose as she searches for a way to connect with the one she lost—and with herself.</p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jPxW\"><i>Selah and the Spades</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jZ8C\"><i>House of Hummingbird</i></a> understand the third-party saviour as more of a structure, that of a school or an inspiring teacher. Selah finds herself by doing business selling recreational drugs to her classmates in a faction-led boarding school. Nothing mends a sense of aimlessness like power. This same framework lets <i>Hummingbird</i>’s Eun-hee, a schoolgirl in mid-90s South Korea whose abusive family invest their academic focus in her useless brother, search for love and find connection in her school books—and from the person who’s asking her to read them.</p><p>The films on this list are not perfect; some might be criticized for specifically following a formula, the tropes of the coming-of-age film, a little too well. <i>Jezebel</i> lets its protagonist rise and fall with familiarity, while Selah suffers the consequences of her extreme actions, and even Eun-hee reckons with a few recognizable pitfalls. But still, the fact that these films exist is “innately radical”, says Irish writer-director David Freyne, whose queer Irish comedy <i>Dating Amber</i> is covered below. The filmmaker describes the coming-of-age genre as mainstream, but in the best possible sense: “It’s a broadly appealing film,” he says.</p><p>This is why, to see these stories reframed with minority voices, with queer voices, is so quietly revolutionary. “The more you see them, the more broadly we see them being enjoyed—the more producers and financiers will realize these stories don’t have to be niche just because they happen to frame a minority voice. Everyone can enjoy it.”</p><p>Film journalist and Letterboxd member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ianamurray/\">Iana Murray</a>, a coming-of-age genre fan, echoes Freyne’s thoughts. “Representation is absolutely not the be-all end-all, but I’d love to see more coming-of-age films that reflect my experiences growing up as a woman of color,” she says, before introducing what I’d like to call the <i>Rashomon</i> Effect. “I see it as like one of those films that tell the same events from different perspectives, something like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a9K\"><i>Rashomon</i></a> or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bWs4\"><i>Right Now, Wrong Then</i></a>,” she explains. “A story becomes even more vibrant when told through a different set of eyes, and that’s what happens when you allow women, people of color, and LGBT people to create coming-of-age narratives.” </p><!--figure[3]--><p><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/nApw\"><i>Dating Amber</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by David Freyne)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/m0T4\"><i>The Half of It</i></a></b> <i>(written and directed by Alice Wu)</i><br/><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/iWDU\"><i>Babyteeth</i></a></b> <i>(directed by Shannon Murphy, written by Rita Kalnejais)</i></p><p>Which brings us on nicely to our last three: wildly different titles, each with young protagonists at war with themselves, trying to make sense of their bodies and minds as best they can. In this context, companionship is everything. Finding a platonic soulmate in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/nApw\"><i>Dating Amber</i></a>, a sexual awakening in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/m0T4\"><i>The Half of It</i></a>, a first love to make a short life worth living in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iWDU\"><i>Babyteeth</i></a>. Each film is directed with a verve and passion that you know must be personal.</p><p>The story of a frustrated boy in the closet in <i>Dating Amber</i> aches with care from Freyne behind the camera, while Alice Wu directs Ellie Chu, the main character in <i>The Half Of It</i>, with patience and the kind of encouragement that quiet girls who live a life between two cultures are rarely given. And with <i>Babyteeth</i>, Shannon Murphy returns Australian cinema firmly to the center of the movie map, with a quintessentially Australian optimism and sense of humor, <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/622865282293268480/wigging-out-shannon-murphy\">which Ben Mendelsohn called “delightfully bent”</a>.</p><p>These perspectives are specific to each teen, but the intensity transcends genres and borders. It manifests musically, verbally, visually, aesthetically. These teens connect with their favorite music and means of entertainment, but also simply to their favorite clothes and accessories—blue bikinis and green wigs, red neck-scarves and floaty white dresses. These details give the characters ways to reinvent themselves while standing still, which certainly feels apt for a life lived, for now, at home.</p><!--figure[4]--><p>Many argue that the coming-of-age genre peaked with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/john-hughes/\">John Hughes</a>, who defined the framework in iconic 1980s films that have his stamp all over them, whether he wrote (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1TEw\"><i>Pretty in Pink</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1MJu\"><i>Some Kind of Wonderful</i></a>) or also directed them (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/27q4\"><i>The Breakfast Club</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1YPY\"><i>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1MJk\"><i>Sixteen Candles</i></a>). Hughes’ world view was of a specifically suburban, white, American corner of the world, which he filled with misfits and ultra-hip soundtracks. “John Hughes was to the genre what The Beatles are to rock and roll,” confirms Letterboxd member Brad, maintainer of the essential coming-of-age movie list <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/moviemaestro/list/teenage-wasteland-a-comprehensive-list-of/detail/by/release/\">Teenage Wasteland</a>.<br/></p><p>After Hughes, the genre tumbled, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Ylk\"><i>Dazed and Confused</i></a>, into the 1990s—notable voices include John Singleton with his seminal <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Ug\"><i>Boyz n the Hood</i></a>, and Gus Van Sant’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Ylk\"><i>My Own Private Idaho</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2ahY\"><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a>. This was also the decade of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Ygk\"><i>Clueless</i></a>, which informed the bright, female-forward fare of the 2000s, like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1VNg\"><i>Mean Girls</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1XCO\"><i>The Princess Diaries</i></a> and the aforementioned <i>Bend it Like Beckham</i>. The last decade has seen new American storytellers step into Hughes’ shoes, including Greta Gerwig (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/dGNE\"><i>Lady Bird</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/aSVk\"><i>Little Women</i></a>), Olivia Wilde and the writers of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/igNS\"><i>Booksmart</i></a>, and the autobiographical voices of Jonah Hill (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/fxIa\"><i>mid90s</i></a>) and Shia LaBeouf (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/ixvm\"><i>Honey Boy</i></a>, directed by Alma Har’el).</p><p>It’s interesting to note—whether it’s the 1860s or the 1980s—that many coming-of-agers from the past decade take place in an earlier period setting. Social media has demanded the upheaval of entire lives, but it seems some filmmakers aren’t yet ready to grapple with its place on screen.</p><p>The audience, on the other hand, is far more adaptable. The way we’re watching coming-of-age films has shifted, and it’s more appropriate for the genre than we could have imagined. On the last day of shooting <i>Dating Amber</i>, Freyne recalls one of the young actors asking, “So, is this going to be on Netflix or something?” This is when cinemas were still open.</p><p>“That’s often how younger people are devouring content now,” Freyne reasons. His film, in the end, was snapped up by Amazon (a US release date is yet to be announced). “It’s creating a communal experience with the intersection of social media: live streams, fan art, daily messages… It’s made us feel incredibly connected, moreso than I think we would have got with a cinematic release.”</p><p>Streaming platforms also cater to one key habit of a younger film lover: the rewatch. The iconic teen films of the 80s embedded their reputations thanks to the eternal allure of the Friday night video store ritual, and constant television replays. These days, it’s only with a film finding a home on Netflix, on Amazon or on Hulu, that a younger person (or, in times of global crisis, any person) can both financially and logistically afford to devote themselves to watching, again and again, these people onscreen that they’ve immediately and irrevocably found a connection with.</p><p>It’s always felt hard to be satisfied with just one viewing of a perfect coming-of-age film—observe how many times Iana Murray has logged <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ianamurray/film/call-me-by-your-name/activity/\"><i>Call Me By Your Name</i></a>. What is it about the slippery, universal allure of the genre? It’s possibly as simple as the feeling of being <i>seen </i>in the fog of intergenerational confusion<i>.</i> Says Nagahisa-san: “Grown-ups think of teenagers like zombies. Teenagers think of grown-ups like zombies. We’re never able to understand what others are feeling inside.”</p><p>“The reaction is always emotive rather than intellectual,” adds Freyne. “There’s something quite visceral and instinctive about coming-of-age films; it’s an emotional experience rather than an analytical one.” That emotional experience is tied up in the fact that we often experience coming-of-age movies just as we ourselves are coming of age, establishing an unbreakable connection between a film and a specific period in our lives. MovieMaestro Brad explains it best: “There is a bit of nostalgia in a lot of these films that take me back to my younger days, when life was simple.”</p><p>But that’s not to say only those coming of age can appreciate a coming-of-age film. On her favorite coming-of-age film, Mike Mills’ <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bqU6\"><i>20th Century Women</i></a>, Murray explains, “It doesn’t see coming-of-age as exclusive to teenagers, because that process of growth is really about transition and change.” (In a similar vein, Kris Rey’s new comedy <a href=\"https://boxd.it/oIva\"><i>I Used to Go Here</i></a>, in select theaters and on demand August 7, meets Kate Conklin, played by Gillian Jacobs, in a sort of quarter-life-crisis, needing to grow down a bit in order to grow up.)</p><!--figure[5]--><p>There is endless praise, conflict and wonder to be found in the ten films mentioned above—and all the ones we haven’t even gone near (Karen Maine’s orgasmic religious comedy <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jaGS\"><i>Yes, God, Yes</i></a>, now available on demand in the US, deserves an honorary mention, as does <a href=\"https://boxd.it/llgK\"><i>Get Duked!</i></a>, Ninian Doff’s upcoming stoner romp in the Scottish Highlands). The thing about this genre is it’s raw, it’s alive, and it’s always in transition. Just when you might think it’s gone out of fashion, it emerges in a new and fascinating form. And yet, there are still so many filmmakers who haven’t tackled the genre. I asked my interviewees who they’d like to see take on a story of teens in transition.</p><p>“I’d love to see Tarantino’s take on a coming-of-age tale,” says master of the genre himself, MovieMaestro/Brad. Murray gives her vote to Lulu Wang, saying, “I love the specificity she brought to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kIky\"><i>The Farewell</i></a>, I think it would transfer well to a genre that needs to escape clichés.” Freyne, meanwhile, wants to see if Ari Aster might have another story about young people in him. Maybe something <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\">a bit less lethal</a> next time.</p><p>Ultimately, “you write from empathy, not from experience,” says Freyne. I think the same goes for watching, too. It won’t be tomorrow, and it might not be this year, but eventually, the world will emerge from Covid-19. What will we have learned from the films that we watched while we were waiting? From the sadness, the angst, the determination, the rage and the passion?</p><p>Nagahisa-san already knows, and his advice is everything we need right now: “You don’t need others’ approval of who you are, as long as you understand and approve of yourself. Do whatever pops up in your mind. Live your life without fear or despair. Just survive.”</p>"

Just don’t get him started on the one action movie cliché that never fails to disappoint.  </p><!--figure[1]--><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>First things first, have you ever had a ride in a helicopter?<br/></b><i>Will Slater: </i>What, do you think I’m mad? Of course I’ve never flown in a helicopter! If I’ve learned anything from watching hundreds of films where helicopters spectacularly explode, it’s that they are a singularly dangerous form of transport. You never know when <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/sylvester-stallone/\">Sylvester Stallone</a> is going to pop up with an <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28TG\">explosive-tipped arrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8NpUCE1W3E\">blow you out of the sky</a>.</p><p><b>I’m going to say the words ‘the definitive action hero/heroine’. Who pops into your head first? No runners-up. Go.<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/294k\">Snake Plissken</a>, no question, for a number of good reasons. First, there’s the look: that eye-patch, the beaten-to-hell leather jacket and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/kurt-russell/\">Kurt Russell</a>’s lustrous <a href=\"https://boxd.it/27xEm\">mane of hair</a>. Second, there’s the attitude: his contempt for authority, the drawled sarcasm and all-round bad-assery. And I also like that he doesn’t have any special abilities. Action heroes generally tend to be either musclebound slabs of beef—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/arnold-schwarzenegger/\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, Stallone—or martial arts specialists—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/jean-claude-van-damme/\">Jean-Claude van Damme</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/jackie-chan/\">Jackie Chan</a>—Plissken is just a pissed-off, angry dude who’s trying to stay alive. He’s very relatable. Plus, I’d argue he pretty much invented the whole anti-hero formula that rules our screens today.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>When did you start your podcast and which film got you into looking deeper into the topic?<br/></b>It was while watching the cheesily bad <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2vqM\"><i>Cyborg Cop</i></a> that I first had an epiphany about the weird and wonderful ways in which helicopters seemed to continually explode in movies. But the film that convinced me to start documenting the phenomenon was <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1C4G\"><i>Stone Cold</i></a>. If you’re not familiar with the film, it was an attempt to turn former gridiron star and mullet-king <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/brian-bosworth/\">Brian Bosworth</a> into the next big action star. It goes without saying that <i>Stone Cold</i> did not transform ‘The Boz’ into the next Arnold Schwarzenegger, but the film wasn’t a total failure as it features <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDYc7oAeh6M\">a helicopter explosion that is as brilliant as it is gloriously stupid</a>.</p><p>And that was the prompt to start the Exploding Helicopter. I launched the <a href=\"https://www.explodinghelicopter.com/\">website</a> in 2009, and the <a href=\"https://explodinghelicopter.podomatic.com/\">podcast</a> followed 2015. Since we started, our aim has been a simple one: to celebrate the strange and inventive ways that helicopters explode in films.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>When did you join Letterboxd? What are your favorite features here?<br/></b>I’ve been around since 2013. As for the features, the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chopperfireball/stats/\">stats</a> are very cool. When you dig into your viewing history, you can learn some very revealing things about yourself. For example, I generally like to think I have a commendably broad taste in film, and watch only the most important and influential works from every decade, genre and country. But then you look at the data and find you’ve watched <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29SE\"><i>Thunderball</i></a> nine times in the last five years, so maybe you’re not as cool as you thought.</p><p><b>We noticed that your profile faves are low-key and explosion-free, given your theme of choice. Why these four and not <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a7u\"><i>Die Hard</i></a> four times?<br/></b>Man cannot live on helicopter explosions alone. Even I need some occasional intellectual nourishment, between watching whirlybird conflagrations. There’s a little bit of nostalgia tied up in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1MzE\"><i>The Ipcress File</i></a>. I first saw it as a kid, and it made a big impression on me. It’s very stylishly directed, has a great <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/john-barry/\">John Barry</a> score and a star-making turn from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/michael-caine/\">Michael Caine</a>. I’m a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/LIM4\">big film noir fan</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29aW\"><i>Sweet Smell Of Success</i></a> is a beautifully sour tale of cynicism and manipulation. To borrow the words of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/burt-lancaster/\">Burt Lancaster</a> in the film, it’s a “cookie full of arsenic”.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jean-pierre-melville/\">Jean-Pierre Melville</a> is my favorite director and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/22ZI\">Le Samouraï</a> was the first of his films that I saw. What Melville does so masterfully in this, and his other crime films, is distil the elements of film noir. Basically, he takes the genre’s iconography—the gun, the trenchcoat, the fedora—and familiar plot tropes—the betrayed assassin, the heist gone wrong, the criminal doing one last job—then elevates them above cliché into something almost mythic. And what do I really need to say about <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b8y\"><i>Taxi Driver</i></a>, other than it’s a masterpiece?</p><p><b>Now you say you shame directors who dishonor the art of helicopter explosions? Which directors did you dirty?<br/></b>Well, one of the biggest names in our hall of shame is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/tony-scott/\">Tony Scott</a>. For a man who specialized in hyper-stylized, pyrotechnic-filled action movies, he flunked every helicopter explosion he filmed. In our eyes, one of the most egregious offences you can commit is failing to show the helicopter explosion. And in both <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Fk\"><i>Spy Game</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Xw2\"><i>Domino</i></a>, old Tony cheats the viewer by having the chopper <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCfPF90BfXQ\">fly out of sight</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRsX1vDAOQw\">before it explodes</a>. Now, I can accept such visual chicanery in a low-budget film, where they presumably don’t have the money to stage the scene, but what’s Tony’s excuse? If you look at his filmography, at one time or another he’s wrecked trains, planes and automobiles in spectacular fashion. But for some reason, he repeatedly couldn’t be bothered to give us a satisfying chopper conflagration. At a certain point, it starts to feel like a personal slight. Tony, what did I ever do to you?</p><p><b>In your immortal words, “<a href=\"https://boxd.it/4sxw\">a film is always improved by a helicopter explosion.</a>” When has this been especially true?<br/></b>When you see lists of worst-ever directors, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/uwe-boll/\">Uwe Boll</a> is a name that always seems to turn up. And, according to the internet, one of his worst-ever films is the video game adaptation, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20Kc\"><i>Far Cry</i></a>. Now, I’m not going to try [to] convince you that the film is a neglected classic, but it does have a very imaginatively staged exploding helicopter scene. It’s too convoluted to explain here, but take my word that it wouldn’t be out of place in a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-fast-and-the-furious-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Fast and Furious</i></a> movie.</p><p><b>What about the unsung heroes; the stunt artists, the pilots, the pyrotechnicians, the VFX wizards who have worked on numerous iconic action moments, all of whom deserve a shoutout?<br/></b>Personally, I don’t understand why the Academy doesn’t have a stunts category. But if they did, I’d be lobbying hard for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/Maxw\">Spiro Razatos</a> to get the first award. These days, he works as a stunt coordinator on the <i>Fast and Furious</i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/captain-america-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\"><i>Marvel</i></a> films, but I’d like to draw people’s attention to some of his early work. Back in the nineties, he did a lot of work with <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mm08\">PM Entertainment</a> films, an independent company that made low-budget action films for the home video market.</p><p>They might not have had much money, but they put every cent on the screen with glorious, raucously inventive set pieces that were often more spectacular than big-budget Hollywood offerings. And remember: this was in pre-CGI times, so every death-defying detail was absolutely ‘real’. Go back and watch films like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/41Eo\"><i>The Sweeper</i></a> or <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3eBq\"><i>Rage</i></a>, and you’ll can see why Super Spiro has now graduated to these more prestigious gigs.</p><p><b>Narrow this list down for us: which is the ultimate most spine-tingly epic “w<a href=\"https://boxd.it/171S8\">e got company</a>” movie moment?<br/></b>As you may have gathered, I do like an action movie cliché. When you encounter one in a film, it’s like meeting an old friend. And one of my favorites is when someone uses this classic line of dialog to signal that a car chase or a gun battle is about to start. I’ve heard people deliver the line in all sorts of ways–funny, scared, angrily and often just badly. But if you want spine-tingly, then you can’t beat <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/harrison-ford/\">Harrison Ford</a> in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/72s\"><i>Star Wars</i></a>. He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjEpLoL0ls\">drops the line during the detention-block scene</a> after failing to bluff an imperial officer. As soon as he says it, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/john-williams-2/\">John Williams</a>’ iconic score kicks in. It gives you the ‘feels’ every time.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>And which action movie cliché can you simply not stand?<br/></b>Stop it: my hackles are raising just thinking about it. For me, the trope that never fails to disappoint is the ‘reluctant’ hero being convinced to take up arms and join the fight. You know the scene. Invariably, the hero has hung up their spurs and is living a bucolic existence ‘off the grid’, when a gruff buddy shows up asking them to risk almost certain death by taking on ‘one last job’. Now, dialog is rarely an action film’s greatest strength, and these beefcake actors generally are not cast for their dramatic chops. Which means we get subjected to the same perfunctory and uninteresting scene over and over again: “I told you, I’m out the game”, “Goddamnit, we need you”, “OK, I’ll do it”. These scenes just never work and are never less than painful to watch.</p><p><b>Which up-and-coming action director are you most excited about?<br/></b>In terms of up-and-coming action talent, I’d pick the director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/stefano-sollima/\">Stefano Sollima</a>. I first noticed his work on a couple of TV series: the fantastic Italian crime dramas, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanzo_criminale_%E2%80%93_La_serie\"><i>Romanzo Criminale</i></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomorrah_(TV_series)\"><i>Gomorrah</i></a>. The way he composed shots really stood out, and it was clear he had a very cinematic eye. He rather reminds me of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/michael-mann/\">Michael Mann</a>. He’s now on Hollywood’s radar and got to direct <a href=\"https://boxd.it/e4fG\"><i>Sicario: Day of the Soldado</i></a> the other year. And he’s lined up to make a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/tom-clancy-1/\">Tom Clancy</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kNyA\">adaptation</a> with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/michael-b-jordan/\">Michael B. Jordan</a>. I can’t wait to see what he comes up with.</p><p><b>Have you witnessed the glory that is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/studio/wakaliwood/\">Wakaliwood</a>—Ugandan DIY action filmmaking—three of which make Letterboxd’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5IwDy\">official top ten films by black directors</a>? Which international films do you feel out-match Hollywood?<br/></b>I love the Wakaliwood films I’ve seen. It’s fascinating to watch action films from around the world and see their different styles and flavors. Recently, I’ve been trying to investigate Indian cinema and, in particular, what are known as ‘<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1QZ4\">masala movies</a>’. These mix action, comedy, drama, romance and dance numbers into one big, crazy, entertaining mess. They’re a unique experience. If you want to check one out, I’d suggest <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1OAa\"><i>Dhoom 2</i></a>. It’s bananas.</p><p><b>Can you believe there are only two <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a1m\">female</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3n1w\">directors</a> represented in your exploding helicopter list? Do you believe that’s due to systemic or thematic reasons?<br/></b>You have to say it’s systemic. Men have dominated filmmaking for more than a century. Until women have the same opportunities to direct and make films as men, it’s impossible to know what their interest may or may not be in blowing up helicopters. [Will has previously written about the search for “<a href=\"https://actionagogo.com/2016/03/08/international-womens-day-time-for-exploding-helicopter-movie-equality/\">true gender equality in the world of exploding helicopters</a>”.]</p><p><b>To address the elephant in the room, how has <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/kobe-bryant/\">Kobe Bryant</a>’s unfortunate death earlier this year changed the way you look at these scenes?<br/></b>Obviously, I appreciate that Kobe Bryant’s death was very shocking and a tragedy for his family and fans. But basketball really is not a thing on these grim shores, so it didn’t register with us unenlightened Brits other than [as] a sad headline about a US sports star.</p><p><b>What was your most anticipated movie event of 2020 before Covid-19 pushed every tentpole back?<br/></b>That’s easy: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/cPX2\"><i>No Time To Die</i></a>. I’m a huge Bond fan and as soon as tickets were available, I booked myself in to see it on opening day at an IMAX. But if the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/daniel-craig/\">Daniel Craig</a> era is synonymous with anything, it’s lengthy delays between films.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>What’s a fond memory you have in theaters related to the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/james-bond-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">Bond</a> franchise?<br/></b>I remember going to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1alk\"><i>Casino Royale</i></a>. I was excited, but also nervous to see it. The <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/pierce-brosnan/\">Brosnan</a> era had ended with the risible <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1a5G\"><i>Die Another Day</i></a>: invisible cars, kitesurfing and, worst of all, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/john-cleese/\">John Cleese</a>’s awful Q. Since that had come out, we’d had <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29cI\"><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/26EE\"><i>Bourne</i></a> and the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Tg0\"><i>Triple X</i></a> films, so it wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility that Bond might be finished. Then the first ten minutes of <i>Casino Royale</i> happened. And while that outstanding <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxNbAwY_rk\">parkour-inspired chase</a> was terrifically exciting, it also hit me like cinematic Valium. I suddenly realised I could sit back and relax, safe in the knowledge that 007 was going to be just fine.</p><p><b>Are you planning on returning to theaters as soon as you can? When would you feel comfortable?<br/></b>I’m taking a wait-and-see approach.

It was not received as such, instead met with huge amounts of ridicule by audiences and critics alike. Pick a Letterboxd review at random, and you get, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/moRij\">for example</a>, “Beautiful direction, so if you put it on mute, it’d probably be great. But nearly every actor is sorely miscast and the script is the hottest garbage.”</p><p> Poor Berkley received a lot of the blame, and although she continued to work, the venomous (and often misogynistic) critiques hindered her career as a big-screen leading lady.  </p><p>Then something funny happened—the film was re-evaluated as a camp classic, driven largely by the queer community, who embraced its over-the-top ridiculousness. The cult has grown considerably over the years, expanding into midnight screenings and even live stage adaptations. Subsequent DVD releases have leaned into the perception by offering commentary tracks that acknowledge the movie’s glorious failings.</p><p><i>Showgirls</i>’ continued presence in the culture has even seen it experience something of an artistic redemption. Its perception is now well beyond that of being simply a camp classic that is so fun because it’s so bad—it’s a genuine cultural touchstone that tells us a lot about how audiences judge films featuring overt sexuality. Indeed, among the many ironies associated with the film is that it was partially designed to highlight American sexual hypocrisy, then failed spectacularly in a manner that effectively highlighted American sexual hypocrisy.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>A brief survey of Letterboxd reviews finds plenty of fans. In a half-star review alongside the exhortation to “please for the love of God watch <i>Showgirls</i>”, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jet852/film/showgirls/\">Letterboxd member Jesse writes</a>: “There shouldn’t be any shame in liking something you know is bad, I don’t have to try and re-codify <i>Showgirls</i> as a secretly good classic just because of how amazing it is. It truly deserves its cult following.” Jesse makes particular mention of the infamous swimming pool sequence, a scene “so unsexy… that it achieves camp euphoria, a pure moment of enlightened cheese that needs to be seen to be believed”.<br/></p><p>“‘So bad it’s good’ it may be for some but I happen to be among the camp that thinks <i>Showgirls</i> is genuine good: a misunderstood work brimming with brilliance,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jaimerebanal/film/showgirls/\">writes</a> Jaime Rebenal, while <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/colonelmortimer/film/showgirls/\">Matt Lynch argues</a> that it’s often mistaken for “a satire of American greed and attendant dreams of stardom, when its true target is the apparatus that sells those dreams to an endlessly returning audience of narcissistic suckers.”</p><p>Or, as Joe <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/zoltarak/film/showgirls/\">puts it</a>, “The Rosetta Stone for understanding this entire movie (if not life itself) is the shot of Elizabeth Berkley angrily slamming a ketchup bottle on the table and causing a bright red stream of ketchup to come flying out.”</p><p>Jeffrey McHale’s ridiculously entertaining new documentary <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/you-dont-nomi/\">You Don’t Nomi</a></i> looks at the cult of <i>Showgirls</i> from a multitude of angles, including the evolving critical and cultural perception of the film, how Verhoeven’s characterization of his intentions have changed over the years, the significance of the film within the LGBTQIA+ community, and how Berkley eventually emerged from the whole affair as something of a hero.<br/></p><p>McHale makes fantastic use of footage from Verhoeven’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/paul-verhoeven-3/\">killer filmography</a><b> </b>to emphasize his points, alongside interviews with a variety of cultural critics. He tells the story of April Kidwell, the writer, producer and star of <i>I, Nomi</i>, a one-woman musical comedy about the life of Nomi Malone before and after her adventures in <i>Showgirls</i>. Kidwell is a fascinating presence in the film, and not just because she also played Nomi in the stage show <i>Showgirls: The Musical!</i> and Berkley’s character in the <i>Saved By The Bell</i>-inspired <i>Bayside: The Musical!.</i><br/></p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>The documentary features illuminating footage from the twentieth-anniversary screening of <i>Showgirls</i> at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, an event that Berkley attended, where she received a rapturous response from the thousands of fans present.</p><p>McHale attended that screening, and told Letterboxd that that’s where his deeper interest in the film was properly sparked.</p><p><i>Jeffrey McHale:</i> I had seen it already, ten years prior to that, but that was the first time I saw it with an audience. I think that was, officially, the largest screening of <i>Showgirls</i> that has happened. There were 4,000 people there. I’m not from LA, but I’ve lived in LA for the last eight years, and I’ve gone to a couple of those Hollywood Forever screenings and I don’t think anyone in our group anticipated Elizabeth Berkley showing up. It felt epic. It was a historic moment in the afterlife of <i>Showgirls</i>.</p><p>I didn’t walk away [from that screening] thinking ‘I should make a documentary’, but I was mostly interested in kind of finding out more. You’re always curious if you can figure anything out about the intentions or what the filmmakers had in mind, so that’s what inspired me to start consuming everything that had been written about <i>Showgirls</i>. I read the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Bb3qg6\">Adam Layman book</a>, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fD77tU\">book of poems</a>, [lots of] articles, and I was just scouring the internet for reviews. And what I found was this wide range of really interesting opinions, theories and people’s relationships with the film. Everything was just so different. You set out looking for answers, and it’s not about getting the answer for it, it’s about this ever-evolving relationship that we have with this piece of art.</p><p><b>At what point did you come to realize the degree to which the queer community had embraced this film?<br/></b>As a gay man myself, it feels like it’s part of the fabric of our culture, ’90s culture. The poet Jeffrey Conway, when I interviewed him, he said it perfectly: it’s just like in your DNA, you know? It appeals to the queer culture community, you cannot explain it but you’re just kind of drawn to it. I thought that was an interesting way of describing the experience of watching something like that.</p><p><b>This film appears to only be widening the cult of <i>Showgirls</i>.<br/></b>It’s been a really fun project, and I’ve been blown away by the response it’s getting. I didn’t really know what the end result would be when I started. I knew that whatever you make, there will be a very vocal and excited and enthusiastic fan base. I’ve been very surprised by the broad appeal. These are people who have never seen <i>Showgirls</i> and are really drawn to it, and find the message and the story, the culture, and the way that we consume media, the way that we critically talk about things. It’s been a wild ride.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>You point out the hypocrisy of how audiences are willing to see Verhoeven’s films as satirical when it comes to the violence (as with </b><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/robocop/\">Robocop</a> </b></i><b>and </b><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/starship-troopers/\">Starship Troopers</a></b></i><b>), but when it comes to the sex, the audience gets prudish.<br/></b>Paul and Joe talked about that on a lot of their press junket interviews: America’s fine with the violence and the violence gets you rated PG13, but then you have something as human as sex, then that’s shunned and discouraged. It was interesting going back and just looking at the way in which Elizabeth was criticized. And the way that Paul was criticized. Just the way she was ripped apart for her physical features and all that, it was disgusting. I think we’ve evolved a little bit further in that sense. I don’t think that you’d see a Gene Siskel review, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz7Jlv1ayy4\">the way that he describes her face</a>, those details, like comparing which one was hotter, it was like: this is what we’re reviewing? Actresses’ physical attributes? It was disgusting. I think we’ve gotten better in that sense.</p><p><b>How did you encounter April Kidwell? She brought a lot to the film.<br/></b>She was one of the later additions to the project, after we’d started reaching out to people. I knew that she was in the musical. Then I found out that she had also done <i>Saved By The Bell</i>. It was really interesting that she played two Elizabeth Berkley characters, to get her opinion on it. From the very first phone call, she was just so open. I was blown away by her story and how vulnerable she was, just putting herself out there. She’s been very open about her experience and the way that it was therapeutic for her. She’s the heart and soul of <i>Nomi</i>. She’s somebody who went through something awful, disgusting, terrible, and now she’s found power and strength, within—specifically—the character. The act of performing Nomi on stage was therapeutic for her. It was an experience that no other person I spoke with had. She’s amazing.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>I loved how you used footage from the other Verhoeven films to provide additional commentary. How did you come to adopt that filmmaking strategy?<br/></b>When I went in, I didn’t how much of that would play into the narrative. I wasn’t familiar with his earlier work. But when I started to go back and watched all of his Dutch films, I was surprised by how all the dots, everything just felt like it was connecting. All these motifs and scenes and shots. And how repetitively these things popped up. So I wanted a visual way, to kind of make it a subplot, where the characters were interacting with <i>Showgirls</i>, where their experience paralleled the contributors, so that was a way to visually tie it back to the argument that people like to think <i>Showgirls</i> sits by itself outside of all of Paul’s other films, like <i>Starship Troopers</i>, <i>Robocop</i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/total-recall/\">Total Recall</a></i>, but tying it into the argument that it’s Verhoeven at his purest, [which is what] I like to think of <i>Showgirls</i> as.</p><p><b>I’m a huge Verhoeven nut and I’d always been disturbed by the dog food subplot in </b><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/spetters/\">Spetters</a> </b></i><b>[in which a takeout van sells croquettes made with jelly-meat], but I had never drawn the connection to </b><i><b>Showgirls </b></i><b>[in which Cristal and Nomi bond over both having once been so poor that they had to survive on dog food]</b><b>. I’d also never noticed how much vomiting is a recurring motif for him.<br/></b>Yeah! Women vomiting! It was always women that were throwing up, which is just bizarre. The doggy chow thing I thought was interesting because [initially] I felt like ‘oh this is a Joe Eszterhas bit’, something from his script that’s just bizarre and weird, but then when I saw that thread from <i>Spetters</i>, it was just like ‘oh my god, you’ve done the whole eating doggy chow thing before’.</p><p><b>I’ve always been interested in Verhoeven’s evolving description of the film himself; how he has recast history a bit to say he was in on the joke, but the funniest thing I thought he ever said about it was that he regretted not putting a serial killer plot in </b><i><b>Showgirls</b></i><b>, because that would’ve distracted the Americans. Had you heard that?<br/></b>I have yes. I think Adam Layman mentioned that. [Verhoeven]’s like: “<i>Basic Instinct</i> was enough of a thriller that people could watch it.” That was something I’d heard a couple of times before. I think he’d actually been considering it, like a death or a murder or something.</p><p><b>Thanks for making your list of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dommer/list/jeffrey-mchales-campy-sequels-to-watch-after/\">Campy Sequels To Watch After <i>Showgirls</i></a>. Talk us through them. What did you make of </b><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/showgirls-2-pennys-from-heaven/\">Showgirls 2: Penny’s From Heaven</a></b></i><b>? I’ve only seen clips.<br/></b>It’s a film that might be better in small doses, not one whole thing, because I think it’s, like, two and half hours long. I think it took me a couple of viewings to get through the whole thing. But it’s interesting because [filmmaker] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/rena-riffel/\">Rena Riffel</a> plays Penny/Hope in <i>Showgirls. S</i>he wrote it, directed it and starred in it, and it follows her character playing off Nomi’s leaving Vegas to go to Hollywood. [Riffel] was in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mulholland-drive/\">Mulholland Drive</a>,</i> so part of me thinks she was trying to do a David Lynch thing. Or a John Waters thing. She’s definitely very aware of the afterlife and the over-the-top campiness of it. So there’s all these little Easter eggs where she’s drawing comparisons to <i>Showgirls</i>. But it’s super low budget, and she kind of embraces that. I would recommend it to hard core fans of <i>Showgirls</i>; it’s definitely not a movie for everybody.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/grease-2/\">Grease 2<br/></a></b></i>‘Cool Rider’—amazing. Christmas-tree dress. I like that the gender roles were flipped. And it’s a fun movie. It’s a fun movie that I always enjoyed as kid.</p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gremlins-2-the-new-batch/\">Gremlins 2: The New Batch<br/></a></b></i>That was another one that I saw late. And I mean, the musical number, Hulk Hogan, just knowing that the director went all out and didn’t hold anything back. I mean—Vegetable Gremlin? There are just so many things it in that are bizarre, and it didn’t follow the traditional 80s/90s sequel formula.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/beyond-the-valley-of-the-dolls/.\">Beyond The Valley of the Dolls<br/></a></i></b>Yeah. You know that Roger Ebert wrote that, right? That’s another one that’s probably closer to <i>Showgirls 2</i> in the Russ Meyer aesthetic of it. But these are all films that had similar [critical trajectories]—it was panned when it came out but got [a] second life. I mean not to the scale that <i>Showgirls</i> has, but I think people revisit it and embrace it for what it </p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/magic-mike-xxl/\">Magic Mike XXL<br/></a></b></i>It feels like they’re more in on the joke, and I kind of found it more enjoyable than the first one, just because it didn’t seem like it was taking itself so seriously. And Jada Pinkett Smith is kind of playing the Matthew McConaughey role. It’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-chill/\">The Big Chill</a></i> meets Chippendales. And as far as the dance numbers go, it feels a lot campier and they’re a little bit more aware of what’s happening. Not as much as like a failed-seriousness kind of camp, but there’s something going on there.</p><p><b>Final question. <i>Showgirls</i>: good or bad?<br/></b>I call it a masterpiece of shit.</p>"

What makes this so special, so fresh—a movie about one day on repeat, released during, you know, a global pandemic, that neat event that makes so many homebound days blur into one—is just how much heart it has. “The little moments, the little cues, the timing,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/neemasadeghi/film/palm-springs-2020/\">Neema Sadeghi </a>points out. “Everything felt so right and my heart was so so warmed.”</p><p><i>The following interview contains discussion of plot points and soundtrack choices, and has been edited for clarity.</i></p><p><b>Could you tell me about your relationship with <i>Groundhog Day</i>, before and after writing <i>Palm Springs</i>?<br/></b><i>Andy Siara: </i>Before and after, I still consider it one of the greatest, if not the greatest comedy of all time. Doing a time-loop thing in this movie was never initially the idea, five years ago when Max and I first started talking about it. It organically evolved to that point. What was helpful to me was thinking about how at the end of <i>Groundhog Day</i>, Bill Murray’s character figures out the meaning of life, to a point, and it ends with the time loop breaking. In our film, Nyles figures out whatever he thinks the meaning of life is, and at the end, nope, the time loop doesn’t break, you’re still stuck here for eternity. So then what do you do? That became the jumping off point. <i>Palm Springs</i> is potentially a sequel to a movie that doesn’t exist, and that helped free myself of repeating too much of what the time-loop genre, and especially <i>Groundhog Day</i>, has done so well.</p><p><b>If the time loop wasn’t the starting point, what was?<br/></b>Nyles. Max and I knew we wanted to do a tiny-budget movie in Palm Springs. We didn’t know what that was, but the first idea was of this character of Nyles. We never outlined anything, so we let the character lead the way. In doing that, I got a full grasp of who he is on a deep level and everything else built from there. We never once were like, “This is a wedding time-loop romcom about two lost souls!” Max and I joked that the earlier version of this was our version of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2amE\">Leaving Las Vegas</a></i>. The story grew from Nyles, thinking: ‘What is the best way to deeply challenge this flawed character?’ And that’s where we came up with Sarah, who became even more fully realized. And the best way to challenge her was Nyles. Putting those two characters together and seeing the friction it causes, the story grew around that.</p><p><b>Their dynamic, and the film more broadly, feels very philosophical. I’m thinking of a line like “Your best bet is to learn to suffer existence”. When you were writing, were there any conscious thinkers you wanted to incorporate?<br/></b>Max and I talked a lot about Albert Camus, and Jorge Luis Borges… but when I got to actually writing, Max gave me his copy of <i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fb62t3\">Be Here Now</a></i> by Ram Dass. His copy, when he gave it to me, had over 100 Post-it notes. We’d talked in abstract ways in a philosophical sense, about individuation and what not. But every day before writing I’d take <i>Be Here Now</i> and open up at any page, read a page to kickstart the day. I think even that idea of suffering existence, that might actually be in <i>Be Here Now</i>…</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>It felt so refreshing to see these characters delivering such epic lines seriously, but the film never becomes somber or dramatic. It stays light. Comedy is balanced with sincere emotion so well—especially when it comes to romance. In a scene outside the cave, when Nyles is giving his big speech, he says, “I’d rather die with you than live in this world without you.” Reading this out of context, it could be from an epic romance. How did you manage to marry the wit with such big feelings?<br/></b>That is one of the lines that, read out of context, could feel heavy-handed, so I appreciate that! From the get-go, it was important to set the tone of this movie, that we will never take ourselves too seriously. Max and I would joke about having one foot on a banana peel and the other in the grave, being able to go from slapstick to serious was always an important tonal shift for us. There’s a silliness to the movie, and so therefore with those lines, my hope is that even in reading the script, by the time you get to a line like that, you as a reader would know what Nyles is like in your mind. Also, I credit Andy Samberg for knowing how to deliver lines like that without them feeling cheesy. When we first met Andy and the Lonely Island guys, he understood this character, by the end better than I did. The character was just words on a page, a figure that existed in my mind. He created this character.</p><p><b>What did you learn from working with the Lonely Island guys, in terms of taking inspiration from their comedy experience while creating something brand new?<br/></b>By the time it got to them, the script was finished to a point that I was happy with. But Max and I didn’t know that much! So those three guys, and Becky Sloviter who was the producer for them, they know so much more than we did. We were able to not only on the practical side make people want to make this movie, but also on the other side, I’d say primarily in third-act stuff, they helped me dig deeper, and find a satisfying conclusion to the movie where the earlier version of the script just wasn’t as satisfying—you still got to the point, but we were able to mess with the mechanics a little bit more. And they got me to dig deeper on the science part too, where I let this journey into the subconscious via a Jungian, individuation approach maybe take hold a little too much!</p><p><b>I’m not very familiar with Palm Springs as a place. What was the appeal to build everything around this specific location?<br/></b>Both Max and I grew up in Southern California, and since the late 1980s I’ve been going to Palm Springs every year—my aunt had a condo out there. The place is a primarily LA retreat, with golf courses and retirement communities. Over the years, it’s just become a place for a lot of weddings to happen. So there’s that side, my own personal history of having seen the change and having gone there so many times over the past 34 years. I remember camping trips to Joshua Tree [National Park]—and I also got married in Palm Springs and went out to countless friends’ weddings there. But then also, I think there are mountain people, desert people, city people. I think I’m a desert person. There’s this mass openness that I find has a magical quality to it. Even if I don’t believe in magic, there’s somehow a magical solitude that comes in the desert. And there’s all sorts of literature, even going into pseudo-science, that is centered around the desert. Specifically the one surrounding Palm Springs.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>It feels like a blank canvas on which anything can happen—and if anything, having more space can make you more anxious about being trapped there.<br/></b>I agree. And I had written two Gram Parsons songs into the script, and he was also drawn to the desert in the 1970s, [the] Joshua Tree area. He wrote a lot there with Keith Richards. There’s some kind of draw to the desert that I don’t totally understand to be honest, it’s on a deeper subconscious level that it strikes that chord for me.</p><p><b>Speaking of the music, the film has so many satisfying needle drops. I’m thinking of Leonard Cohen’s ‘The Partisan’ and then Kate Bush’s ‘Cloudbusting’ in that amazing final scene. Were these written in from the start?<br/></b>A lot of songs were written in from the start that didn’t make it in for various reasons. ‘Cloudbusting’ came up in our first or second meeting with Andy—it was his idea and we were like, that’s perfect! Andy and Max [and I] all wanted to make sure <i>Palm Springs</i> didn’t use songs we had seen a million times in other movies. It was so important to us. And then we also wanted songs that spoke to a more magical quality too. I think the Leonard Cohen one was Cristin’s idea, so it was a very collaborative field, but we all knew what kind of stuff we wanted. It was about thinking, let’s try and find a sonic happy place.</p><p><b>What film first made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aA2\"><i>Jurassic Park</i></a> is my number one. It made me want to do everything.</p>"

How do we start making money again?</p><p>Other Disney executive: It might be nice, it might be nice… to get Hamilton on our side.”</p></blockquote><p>Sure, business. Still, it’s historically unprecedented that a Broadway show of this caliber (a record-setting sixteen Tony nominations, eleven wins, plus a Grammy and a Pulitzer) would be filmed and released to the public while it’s still, in a Covid-free universe, capable of filling theaters every night. Will people stay away when Broadway reopens because they’re all Disney+’d out?</p><p>No chance, reckons <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1epCkn\">Erika</a>. “I’d still kill to see <i>Hamilton</i> live with any cast… I get why producers are afraid that these videos might hurt ticket sales, but I’m fucking ready to buy a ticket and fly to NY one day just to see as many shows as I can after watching this.”</p><p>Not every musical fan has the resources to travel, often waiting years for a touring version to come near their hometown. And even if you do live in a town with <i>Hamilton</i>, the ticket price is beyond many; a daily lottery the only way some of us get to go. So <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1emy4z\">Holly-Beth</a> speaks for many when she writes: “I entered the <i>Hamilton</i> lottery every day for almost two years but I never got to be in the room where it happens… however, this 4K recording of the original cast will do very nicely for now! Finally getting to see the context and performances after obsessing over the music for years was so, so satisfying.”</p><p>“Finally” is a common theme. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ejzN5\">Sydnie</a> writes, “I love this musical with every fiber of my body and it was an extraordinary experience finally getting to watch it in Australia”. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eBimx\">Flogic</a>: “To finally be able to put the intended visuals to a soundtrack that I’ve had on repeat for such a long time: goosebumps for 160 minutes.” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1elH6d\">Newt Potter</a>: “Now I fully understand people’s love for this masterpiece of a musical!”</p><!--figure[2]--><h2>I’ve got a small query for you.</h2><p>Where’s the motherfucking swearing? Unsurprisingly, Disney+ comes with some limitations. For <i>Hamilton</i>, it’s the loss of a perfectly placed F-word.</p><p>“I know Disney is ‘too pure’ to let a couple of ‘fucks’ slip by,” writes <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eol5j\">Fernando</a>, “but come on, it’s kind of distracting having the sound go out completely when they sing the <i>very</i> satisfying ‘Southern Motherfucking Democratic Republicans!’ line.” </p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1emRWb\">Will</a> agrees: “Disney cutting ‘motherfucking’ from ‘Washington on Your Side’ felt like sacrilege akin to Mickey Mouse taking an eyebrow pencil to the Mona Lisa.” </p><p>Nevertheless, sings <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1en0q9\">Allison</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Even tho Disney stripped the story of its f***s,<br/>Don’t think for a moment that it sucks.”</p></blockquote><p>(Yes, she has <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1en0q9\">a vegan alert</a> for <i>Hamilton</i>.)</p><!--figure[3]--><h2>Does it throw away its shot?</h2><p>The crew filmed two regular shows in front of live audiences, with additional audience-less sessions for a dolly, crane and Steadicam to capture specific numbers. The vast majority of you are satisfied. “It’s the most engaging and expertly crafted life filming I’ve seen since <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ygo\">Stop Making Sense</a></i>,” writes <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eoVjB\">ArtPig</a>. “The film does an incredible job of placing you right in the action. It feels like the best seat you could get in the theater. You can see the sweat and spit.”</p><p>“Translates perfectly onto the small screen,” agrees <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1emBn5\">Ollie</a>. “There’s a level of intimacy that feels hard to replicate in any other filmed production. We see those close ups, the passion and gusto behind every actor’s performance.”</p><p>“Shockingly cinematic for something filmed on such a small stage,” is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ejBJz\">Technerd</a>’s succinct summary, while <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1elp7d\">Paul</a> praises director Thomas Kail: “He knows when to back away along with moving nearer when appropriate, and the choices always serve to govern the power and stamina of the performances.”</p><p>Though cast members’ voices were recorded on individual audio tracks, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1epdFZ\">Noah</a> had a few quibbles with the sound quality. “Some of the audio capture is off in the recording, sometimes voices being too soft or too loud. It’s not immersion breaking, but it is noticeable enough to irk me a little in pivotal moments. Some of the shot composition doesn’t fully work either. Of course nothing is going to be as good as seeing it in person.”</p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eJf7P\">Robert</a>, recalling <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jydK\">another recent cinematic escapade of musical theater</a>, lets his poetry do the talking:</p><blockquote><p>“This will do for now until the true movie’s made,<br/>Though if Hooper directs, there’ll be an angry tirade.”</p></blockquote><!--figure[4]--><h2>I think your pants look hot.</h2><p>Hamilton fans have their cast favorites, but something about being able to see Jonathan Groff’s spittle and Leslie Odom Jr’s scowls in 4K has you losing it all over again. Several specific shout-outs we enjoyed:</p><p>“Daveed Diggs the Legend! Go watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hDMw\"><i>Blindspotting</i></a> (2018), it’s one of the best movies ever!” —<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eoEjp\">Kyle</a></p><p>“It’s hard to believe anyone will ever top Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr. I already loved him from the original cast recording, but seeing his full performance in all its glory was just godly.” —<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1epCkn\">Erika</a> </p><p>“Thankful that it was made possible for me to view with such clarity the phenomenon that is Renée Elise Goldsberry and spectacular Phillipa Soo.” —<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eEumP\">Thea</a></p><p>“Daveed Diggs was electrifying and Jonathan Groff was absolutely hilarious. If they interacted together the stage would’ve combusted from the sheer will of their talent.” —<a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eJfMN\">Nick</a> </p><!--figure[5]--><h2>This is not a game.</h2><p>On one hand, the release of <i>Hamilton</i> is sweet relief for music theater nerds riding out the pandemic. A generation of kids knows every word by heart, rapping (this version of) American history like it’s no thing. On the other, the Obama-era musical already feels behind-the-times, even for many <i>Hamilton</i> lovers, and the filmed version has brought that into sharp focus.</p><p>“I listened to the OG cast album about 50 times when it came out, the production is about as good as I’d always hoped,” writes <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1enHm5\">Josh</a>. “Since then however there’s been a very important and broader reckoning with the failures of neoliberalism and the Obama years ([from] which this has to be the most emblematic piece of art) and for me personally a drifting further to the left that has resulted in a very different relationship with the material. So my feelings today are a bit more complicated.”</p><p>“<i>Hamilton</i> is extremely non-committal about its politics,” writes <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1enVjT\">Sting</a>. “It doesn’t examine much of what Hamilton dictated besides ‘he wants complete financial control of the country’ (which would sound like a fucking supervillain in any other context, including reality).”</p><p>That lack of political commitment, reckons <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eEYSB\">Morgan</a>, is what helped <i>Hamilton</i> as a musical become so popular: “It’s fun. It’s catchy. It interweaves trendy and socially relevant artistic tools to infer a subversive subtext, while simultaneously sanitizing and, at times, flat out fabricating the historical narrative and downplaying the brutality of the true origin story, for the sake of appeasing those in power. Classic Bill Shakespeare stuff.”</p><!--figure[6]--><h2>History has its eyes on you.</h2><p>Much criticism lies with the fundamental storytelling decision to make a modern ruckus about America’s Founding Fathers, the men (including Alexander Hamilton) who in the late eighteenth century united the thirteen colonies and co-wrote the Constitution. Undisputed titans of history, they also have blood on their hands, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/_honeyrose/film/hamilton-2020/\">HoneyRose</a> writes that the musical “glorifies these men, and paints them as self-sacrificing heroes, and honestly normalizes and validates slavery, as well as the behavior of slave owners.”</p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eo4C1\">Stevie</a>, who saw the Broadway production as well as the filmed version, confesses: “I’ve tried (I’ve really tried) to understand what makes people lose their minds over this but I’m still completely baffled by the hype… These were horrible men and a romanticism of them through song and dance just seems entirely misguided.”</p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eoE8V\">Sean</a> is not convinced that <i>Hamilton</i> is a hagiography. “I can’t imagine anyone watching all of this and thinking it paints a portrait of the Founding Fathers as anything other than childish, greedy, venal and self-aggrandizing.” <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ep5tr\">Wesley</a> agrees: “I don’t think <i>Hamilton</i> is trying to be a history lesson, so much as a lesson about how we think about history. It’s a compelling human story told in a revolutionary way.”</p><p>That “revolutionary way” is the musical’s central conceit: that of a cast-of-color playing the white founding fathers as they bumble towards independence. Journalist <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eognn\">Jamelle Bouie</a>, who regards the musical as “fun, exciting, innovative and, at points, genuinely moving,” wrestles with the “celebratory narrative in which the Framers are men to admire without reservation. Through its casting, it invites audiences of color to take ownership of that narrative, as if they should want to take ownership of a narrative that white-washes the history of the revolution under the guise of inclusion.”</p><p>It’s complicated for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eEtPL\">Matt</a>, too: “It’s widely agreed upon that the show encapsulates the Obama era better than anything, how it coddles white liberals with a post-racial vision of history in a superficial sense, overlooking the insidious and oppressive systems that they benefit from (hearing the audience clap to ‘Immigrants, we get the job done’ unsettled me). Of course hopefully its legacy will be that it opened up more Broadway roles for POC. But I really think that the show doesn’t make Broadway more appealing and accessible to POC, it just makes hip hop more accessible to white people, a launching pad of course to listening to Watsky or something.</p><p>“No hate though to anyone that’s completely in love with this, it’s definitely worth seeing despite any hang ups.”</p><!--figure[7]--><h2>I wanna build something that’s gonna outlive me.</h2><p>The story doesn’t end, just because the music does. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1eErAf\">Kai_Kenn</a> has a suggestion: “I have been a part of discussions that dissect the culture that created <i>Hamilton</i>, as well as the culture that <i>Hamilton</i> created, and whether or not <i>Hamilton</i> appropriately addresses the modern issues [that] the cult following proposes it does. </p><p>“This is an ongoing discussion that I am trying to be an active listener in and, if you consider yourself to be a conscientious consumer of art, you should too.”</p><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1epdFZ\">Noah</a> is on board with that: “Reflecting on the past and focusing on the future are not two mutually exclusive actions. Both are a must, regardless of who you are or what you do. A five-star experience in a four-and-a-half-star film. I think that’s just fine.”</p>"

I went back and read the play just before we started pre-production, and the thing I really loved in the play—not actually in the production but on the page—was the title chapters, and the through line of these whispers written in, of what the dead said to Milla.</p><p><b>What did you feel when you first read Milla’s story?<br/></b>I was really distraught at the end, but not for the reasons you might think. It was more because I couldn’t handle the idea that I couldn’t spend any more time with these characters. It just devastated me that my time with them was over, like with a really amazing novel, you just don’t want your connection with them to end. I thought that was a really great sign. I’d been looking for a first feature for some time, but I knew it had to truly represent my tone, and the kind of artist I wanted to show the world I was. It’s a really difficult thing to do when you’re not a writer yourself.</p><p><b>I felt so distraught when the film ended, and it does just give you the urge to rewatch immediately—it makes you wish it was longer.<br/></b>That’s so great to hear, I’ve had a few people say that they rewatched it more than once and it’s so exciting to me. That is the aim, that you make something that is worth watching again, because you know you’ll get even more out of it the more you watch it—it’s somehow gotten into your bones.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>One of your actors, Ben Mendelsohn, said <i>Babyteeth</i> is both “delightfully bent” and “beautifully Australian”. What do these terms mean to you?<br/></b>The offset humor is what I’d say he’s talking about, and also the idea to really push through the pain. Australians are really great at saying, “You’ll be alright, chin up.” There’s quite an optimism in our culture. In many ways I really focused on the sound design being really Australian. We shot in February, which is summer, so it was really hot, the cicadas were going crazy, and the birds—our birds sound like people screaming, they’re really intense. It brought such an Australian essence to it.</p><p><b>Could you recommend any Australian filmmakers or specific titles for Letterboxd members?<br/></b>Shirley Barrett’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/4CM\">Love Serenade</a></i> is amazing. <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/Yzk\">The Last Days of Chez Nous</a></i> by Gillian Armstrong. And of course <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/4HM\">Sweetie</a></i> by Jane Campion is a brilliant piece. I also love <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/LBi\">Samson and Delilah</a></i> by Warwick Thornton. [See Shannon’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/shannon-murphys-australian-favorites/\">other Australian film recommendations</a>.]</p><p><b>Moses is such an untraditional love interest, yet so charming. How did you build that character from Rita’s writing, and work with Toby to bring such a physicality to life?<br/></b>It was so important to me with all the characters that you didn’t judge them, despite the behaviors they’re showing because they’re under stress. With Moses it was really important that it wasn’t just about the drug abuse, that it was really about understanding the behavior behind that and why that’s happening. We worked closely with a friend of mine who is a drug and alcohol specialist, and he was always saying, “Don’t talk about the drugs, it’s not what is actually behind this.” We did detail his poly-substance abuse and what he was taking, so that at least Toby and I knew as we were charting the journey.</p><p>Toby, in his audition, was just so generous to all the other Millas in the room. Not once was he really thinking about himself, although the stakes were really high and I knew he really wanted the role. I love that, because to me Moses is a really generous person to Milla. I knew I’d have to transform him physically quite a lot, because he’s a very good-looking guy, and we also wanted to break Moses down a lot. With his skin we did that, with his tattoos, and each of his tattoos has a lot of meaning for Moses. Toby and our make-up artist Angela Conti crafted that together. And he’s a very physical performer, very in his body. Who else can pull off shorts like that, quite frankly? I just loved that about him. He’s fearless.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Toby gives such an amazing performance. I hadn’t seen him in anything before but a friend said she’d seen him in a Netflix show recently in which he was so despicable, whereas he’s totally transformed here.<br/></b>He’s really my kind of actor because you can throw anything at him and he’s up for it. He’s got an incredible range. And the same with Eliza, they can shapeshift so easily. They’re two very intelligent people, they’re able to get out of their heads and into their bodies quite easily.</p><p><b>I have to ask more about Eliza. How did you create Milla with her, physically, specifically in terms of her clothes, her style—I have the image of the blue wig in my mind. How did aesthetics feed into Milla’s psychology?<br/></b>You know what’s so funny? Everyone calls it the blue wig, but it’s totally green. I don’t know what happened in the [color] grade there, but everyone calls it the blue wig. Even Eliza in an interview the other day said the blue wig, and it was totally green! Anyway, hilarious. Everyone is calling it the blue wig so we can stick with that.</p><p>At that age, you are constantly reinventing yourself. Particularly when you meet someone you’re falling in love with, you’re like, who am I going to be to this person? Because this person is also changing who I am and how I see the world. And also she’s completely being a punk, and she’s pushing against her parents, pushing against the world. With her outfits, we spent a lot of time talking about that with my amazing costume designer Amelia Gebler. She’s so bold. We were like, at that age, you just don’t give a shit. You’re trying out different things. Also, the new generation is experimenting with fashion in a way that I think is really impressive. So we wanted to make sure that it felt timeless, and so we did the big pattern clashes for the night out, and also she’s wearing that great unicorn T-shirt, it’s so childlike, but also a bit punk-y when she’s in her home. But then she transitions from the more feminine, girly colors to lilac, which is Moses’ color for the night out. We loved the idea of them both being in the same color for that night.</p><p>And then the different wigs, we called the blonde one the Amy Winehouse wig. We would call it “wig-gate” on set, because you always had to make sure you had the right wig on during the transformations. We talked about how initially she has that cancer wig, which is the long blonde one, which is a real cancer wig from a company that makes them specifically for that. Then we moved to Amy Winehouse for the night out, and then we’d go to the blue wig. It always felt like we were doing it at points when she was really shifting emotionally, and playing different versions of herself in many ways.</p><p><b>What was the first film that made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b>Is it okay if it’s not a film? I was quite obsessed with Jim Henson’s television series <i>The Storyteller</i>. It was such a dark fable that I watched at such a young age. I remember John Hurt being the narrator, I would just get so sucked into these stories. Even still today I can remember so many of them so vividly. They were really creative. Jim Henson was someone who was so out of the box, really pushing our imagination in ways that have stayed with so many of us.</p>"

Huge acclaim, an Academy Award, and growing fandom followed, but the studio has long shied away from making its catalog available for digital consumption, preferring the films to occupy a larger canvas.</p><p>And then, all of a sudden, Suzuki-san announced the digital streaming plan—starting with the whole catalog being made available to own (via download) last December. “We’ve listened to our fans,” Suzuki-san said at the time. “In this day and age, there are various great ways a film can reach audiences.” This turn of events has been a very big deal—both for long-time fans <a href=\"https://boxd.it/10kQVr\">and Ghibli newbies</a>—and we’ve run the numbers to prove it:</p><!--figure[1]--><p>The above chart shows the daily number of entries logged on Letterboxd for each of the Ghibli films, and clearly depicts the February, March, April and late May spikes as groups of titles were released to the two aforementioned streaming platforms (and mini spikes coinciding with weekend watches).</p><p>The Ghibli films included in the streaming deals stretch over four decades of the studio’s output, and include big-hitters like the Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/spirited-away/\"><i>Spirited Away</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/princess-mononoke/\"><i>Princess Mononoke</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/howls-moving-castle/\"><i>Howl’s Moving Castle</i></a> and the whole-family favorite <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/my-neighbor-totoro/\"><i>My Neighbor Totoro</i></a>. All of those films appear in the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/8HjM\">Official Letterboxd Top 250</a>; <i>Totoro</i> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JAY\"><i>Kiki’s Delivery Service</i></a> also made it onto a list of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/its-a-wonderful-life/\">Letterboxd members’ top twenty favorite comfort films</a> in a recent survey.</p><p>To get a sense of what this all means, we went to Letterboxd members <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jakecunningham/\">Jake Cunningham</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nevsky/\">Michael Leader</a>, hosts of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2bv3w\">Ghibliotheque</a>, a podcast dedicated to the studio’s filmography, about the Netflix deal (“none of us could quite believe it when it happened”) and the clues Ghibli films offer us for how to have adventures inside our own homes.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Earlier in the pandemic, when we were all figuring out how to stay home, you hosted a joyous <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> watch-along. What is it about the fuzzy, mythical creatures that feels so helpful right now?<br/></b><i>Michael Leader:</i> In some ways, the world’s mum is in hospital right now. We’re all working from home. There’s the bit halfway through the film where the dad is trying to get on with his work in the study, and [his daughter] Mei is coming up and putting little flowers on his desk. That’s what everyone is doing right now, is trying to get on with their work whilst their kids are milling about, full of imagination and adventures.</p><p>With <i>Totoro</i>, I go back to a guest we had on the show, Helen McCarthy, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BUtfRD\" target=\"_blank\">who wrote the book about Miyazaki</a>. And she described <i>Totoro</i> as something like “kindness and acceptance made furry”, and that’s really what it is. The idea of this creature being there for you, coming out of the surroundings that you live in, allowing you to not only come into a new space that you’re maybe scared of going into, but also dealing with tricky situations that you’re in.</p><p><b>You’re both deeply embedded in the London film scene, but the dynamic of your Ghibliotheque podcast is that Michael is the long-time Ghibliophile, while Jake is the novice. How did that come about?<br/></b><i>Jake Cunningham:</i> Michael and I actually work together, and it came up that I hadn’t seen any of the films and then it happened to come up that Michael was one of the UK experts of these films and was having a go at me for never having watched any. This was the perfect opportunity to work on something with each other, and my ignorance has finally paid off, because all I need to do is watch the film and then I get this amazing history lesson.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i>ML: </i>It was really fun for me, because by that point—this is nearly two years ago now—I’d been writing about Ghibli on and off for almost a decade. There aren’t really many outlets to write about anime, Ghibli and animation in particular, in the monthly film magazines. Jake is the novice we can take through the library and invite people to join us on that journey. We have listeners who are so engaged, sending us comments every week. They had no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p><p>That’s something that was personally for me quite important about the show. We want to show that this is one of the few studios that has ten five-star films. They had this amazing streak from the late 80s through the 2000s, just innovating on every film at the highest level, with multiple voices working in their own different worlds. We’ve really managed to show this whole world and invite people into it.</p><p><b>What did you make of the Netlix flex, and the subsequent explosion in Letterboxd activity around Ghibli films?<br/></b><i>JC:</i> The graph is amazing! I was expecting a boost but not so big. They must be very happy with how well the deal has done for them. I think it’s a good place for Ghibli for sure. I want so many other people to be in the position that I was in two years ago. It is a whole world of pleasure to delve into for audiences. </p><p>I did think it was so funny that they spent fifteen years going “We’re never going to be streaming, this is never going to happen, stop asking us”, and then out of nowhere the announcement that they’re going to be online in two weeks! I think none of us could quite believe it when it happened, but what it’s meant is people are going back to the start of the podcast and listening along, because they can finally watch the films that they hadn’t seen before.</p><p>And it’s so exciting that people might watch <i>Totoro</i>, or <i>Spirited Away</i>, or <i>Howl’s Moving Castle</i>, these bigger tentpole releases, and that’s going to change their algorithm and they’re going to get presented with Isao Takahata’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1KC2\">My Neighbors the Yamadas</a></i> or Tomomi Mochizuki’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1CtQ\">Ocean Waves</a></i>. The under-appreciated Ghiblis are suddenly going to get dragged out again.</p><p><i>ML:</i> I’m really excited about it. It’s an interesting thing: it shines a light on what I think is more of a fandom problem, where something becomes rarified or scarce or special to a certain subculture, and that becomes part of its appeal. Sort of ‘Oh, Miyazaki doesn’t believe in streaming, he will never sell out’, and going on about how Netflix somehow cheapens it—but really they are completely accessible films that should be available in a mass market.</p><!--figure[4]--></a></figure><p>Also, and this is something we wanted to tease out in the podcast, they are business savvy. They’re not crazy geniuses who live in wooden shacks in the middle of nowhere. They’re a real company that needs to keep the lights on. There are so many ways to speculate on what this deal means. I think on the one hand they were happy because in the Japanese market they sell enough merchandise, they have a real home entertainment churn going, that they never really needed to do an international release.</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BiobGR\" target=\"_blank\">There’s a really good book just out by Steve Alpert</a>, who was their first international division lead. He was hired in the 90s to sort out their penetration into western Europe and America. Before the 90s, there were a couple of home entertainment releases and small theatrical runs, but they suddenly saw the business benefits in going global. In some ways I’m very happy for it because it’s a business deal that makes these films more available. They’ll always be special because they’re great films.</p><p><i>JC:</i> The films streaming is extremely exciting, but something that’s gone under the radar a bit is that all of the music is now on Spotify. There are some of Ghibli’s shorts that you can only watch in the museum in Japan, but the scores for those films are now on Spotify, and <i>everything</i> is there. After having the melodies of some of these stuck in my head for months and months, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX7GTqMQDhOum\" target=\"_blank\">you can finally actually go and deal with the earworm once and for all</a>.</p><p><b>Is it possible for you to sum up for us the thematic essence of Ghibli films, and make a case for why Letterboxd members should introduce their children to the catalog? For me, in the context of the pandemic, it’s the corn on the window-sill in <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i>: the idea of presence despite distance; connection through gesture; the significance of nature.<br/></b><i>JC:</i> It’s a lot to do with leaving things in an ambiguous space. Having kids watch things where there’s not a binary answer to everything. The studio moved away from the earlier films where a villain is a villain. In <i>Spirited Away</i> and <i>Howl’s Moving Castle</i>, it’s less clear what a ‘bad person’ is and what a ‘good person’ is. I think it’s important that kids are gonna see that. Even with something like <i>Kiki’s Delivery Service</i>, on the surface it’s one of their simpler films. Kiki goes on an amazing journey and she meets amazing people, and at the end, she learns about who she is and what she can do. I think in a Western kids’ film that would be the end note. But there’s that note at the end of the film where she says that she still feels sad, and she still feels homesick, but that’s okay and that’s part of being alive.</p><p><i>ML:</i> I think Miyazaki’s real magic touch across his films is that he’s able to really look at the world through children’s eyes. I’m not the first person to say that. It tends to be one of the first things that people say about him. The magical things about <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> are when they’re just walking through the house, cleaning the house, cooking together. And for Kiki, when she gets her own [apartment], sweeps up and cooks herself pancakes. It is just as much about the magic of the everyday, about the world that you can see around you, within the four walls of the home.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i>JC:</i> Now that you say that, I’m thinking about <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1S0A\">Ponyo</a></i>, a key scene where the storm is hitting, and Sosuke and Ponyo and Sosuke’s mum just hunker down in their house and they have a generator going and they make instant ramen noodles, and the mum slips in little bits of ham. They also have some honey tea. Even though he’s a fantasy filmmaker, and he makes grand statements about geopolitical situations, these are the sequences now which will play most poignantly to people.</p><p><i>ML:</i> Ghibli offers escapism, right now.</p><p><b>We got a glimpse of the next Ghibli film, Gorō Miyazaki’s fully-CG <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/pu34\">Aya and the Witch</a></i> (see picture below), via the online version of the recent Annecy International Animated Film Festival. What are your thoughts?<br/></b><i>JC:</i> Regarding the new images, I’m not as petrified as some fans have been. On the podcast I’ve mounted my defence for Gorō’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/17ae\">Tales From Earthsea</a></i>, which is very much the black sheep of the family, and I don’t think I’d be doing him justice after that if I didn’t stand in his corner on this one as well. Until we see the style in motion, I think it’s unfair to judge, but it certainly is… different.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>Jake, are you now a true Ghibliophile, or are you still just following along with what Michael’s got you into?<br/></b><i>JC:</i> I would say I am now. I could definitely bore people in conversations with production stories! A lot of people will, I’m sure, have seen a lot of the films, but doing the podcast is the only thing that would have made me watch all of them.</p><p><b>Michael, how proud are you of this achievement?<br/></b><i>ML:</i> Turning Jake into a new Ghibiliofile is really something. When we went to Japan in November last year—we managed to find change down the back of the sofa, and take the team out and visit the museum, visit Studio Ponoc, who are the spin-off studio founded by veterans from Ghibli—the thing that made me most proud was seeing how excited the rest of the team were. I think just out of shot of Jake’s webcam is a poster of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1MR4\">Only Yesterday</a></i> that he bought in Japan. It’s the only thing he wanted to find, was an original 1991 poster of that. There’s a picture of Jake just absolutely beaming with this poster.</p>"

Let’s look at how Ovid, Euripides and Virgil have woven their way into the fabric of each of these stories. (Spoilers ahead!)</p><!--figure[1]--><h2>The Melancholy Experience of Finite Love and the Desire of the Gaze: Céline Sciamma’s <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> meets Virgil’s ‘Orpheus and Eurydice’</h2><p>Virgil’s story of Orpheus and Eurydice is woven so literally and metaphorically into Céline Sciamma’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jkPq\"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a> that it’s interesting to discover how late in the piece it came. Sciamma told me in an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2019 that the story was one of the last elements to be included in the script. When she re-read the myth, she felt it ran perfectly parallel to Marianne and Hëloise’s relationship because the concept of gaze is extremely important for both couples.</p><p>In Virgil’s tale, it was prophesied that the marriage of Orpheus and Eurydice would be short-lived—and so it was. Eurydice dies from a snake bite, and her soul is sent to Hades. While in mourning, Orpheus gets the attention of the gods by singing and playing the lyre.</p><p>Being the rule-breaker that he is, Orpheus travels to the underworld to bring Eurydice back. Hades and Persephone are moved by his music and grant his wish that he will reunite with his wife, instructing him to keep his eyes front while his wife walks behind him into the living world. Unfortunately, he turns around—and loses her forever. We don’t know why he turned around when he was told not to—did he make the poet’s choice, or the lover’s? Perhaps the memory of Eurydice felt more feasible than having her physically.</p><p>In Sciamma’s film, Marianne (the painter), Hëloise (her subject) and Sophie (the maid) are isolated on a small island in eighteenth-century France. The trio carve out a microcosmic community where they are equal peers and status has no power. Hëloise reads the story of Orpheus to her two friends; they discuss whether he makes the poet’s choice, or the lover’s choice. Marianne and Hëloise engage in a romantic relationship, subverting the hostile, patriarchal world they live in. When their time is finally up and Marianne is running to the door to leave, Hëloise requests she turn around to see her one last time, thus imprinting a lasting image in Marianne’s mind. No one dies in their story, but, with a look, their love for one another lasts beyond the physical world.</p><p><b>Watch</b>: Céline Sciamma discusses the myth of Eurydice and Orpheus in <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/23/21299034/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-criterion-clip-celine-sciamma-orpheus-eurydice-exclusive\">this clip from the new Criterion release of</a> <i><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/23/21299034/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-criterion-clip-celine-sciamma-orpheus-eurydice-exclusive\">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a>.</i></p><!--figure[2]--><h2>Reflections and personae in <i>The Neon Demon</i>: Nicolas Winding Refn takes on Ovid’s ‘Echo and Narcissus’</h2><p>The harsh modeling world is the perfect backdrop for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/9AnW\"><i>The Neon Demon</i></a>, which deals with ideals of beauty, deceit and narcissism. The film is also a loose adaptation of the Roman poet Ovid’s story of Echo and Narcissus from Book III of <i>Metamorphoses</i>. Narcissus is the beautiful hunter who upsets Aphrodite when he rejects a low-level goddess in the most asshole-y way. She curses him, and he ends up drowning when he falls in love with his reflection and tries to kiss it over a pool of water.</p><p>In <i>The Neon Demon</i>, Jesse (Elle Fanning) wants to be fashion’s next ‘it’ girl. She has youth and beauty on her side, which invokes jealousy in others. As her star rises, Jesse is consumed by vanity. After her harsh rejection of make-up artist Ruby (Jenna Malone), and going on an egomaniacal tirade, she is pushed into an empty pool by Ruby’s friends Sarah (Abbey Lee Kershaw) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote), thus breaking her neck.</p><p>Two stories from different millennia share a common thread: characters who love themselves to death (literally). What separates them is the queer subtext, particularly in <i>The Neon Demon</i>. Does Refn know his film had queer subtext? Perhaps not, though the film itself is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/416os\">often included</a> in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hZti\">modern queer horror lists</a>. There is an explicit attraction between the main characters, and he does an excellent job examining what that looks like when they are clouded by envy. For the women, this desire manifests in the form of companionship (Ruby), status (Gigi) or consumption (Sarah). This queer interpretation aids Refn’s exploration of relationships that exists outside of the typical portrayal of female desire.</p><p>There is a debate among viewers regarding the queer subtext and the lesbian body horror aspects of the film. Many of the film’s critics denounced the level of sexual objectification of the young women. However, objectification is a hallmark of the story: it’s a movie about the modeling world. What people miss is not only how the external world oversexualizes these characters, but how they objectify one another, and that gaze lends itself to a strong queer asthetic.</p><!--figure[3]--><h2>Outcasts and killer cults in Sweden: Euripides’ <i>The Bacchae</i> as told through Ari Aster’s <i>Midsommar</i></h2><p>In Greek tragedy <i>The Bacchae</i>, Dionysus tells the citizens of Thebes he is the son of Zeus. No one believes him. He is gaslit to the point of shame. With his reputation in a shambles, the spurned demigod leaves Thebes. He soon returns in disguise with a pack of rabid women who call themselves the Bacchae—they kill King Pentheus and burn Thebes to the ground because they didn’t listen. No-one listens to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\"><i>Midsommar</i></a>’s main character, Dani, either.</p><p>Dani is in an emotionally abusive relationship with the gaslighting Christian, and is surrounded by Christian’s friends who reject her and see her as an emotional burden. Imagine how unhappy they are when Dani accompanies them on their trip to Sweden to visit the commune of the Harga people for their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer\">Midsummer</a> celebration. Things spiral out of control when Dani unintentionally rises to godlike status within the Harga cult, which leads to, let’s just say, consequences for her dissenters.</p><p>On its surface, <i>Midsommar</i> is not queer cinema—at the center of the film is a heterosexual couple. However, Dani is an emotional outcast and feels like an outsider no matter where she is; it’s an echo of queer experience that is heightened when the women of the Harga embrace Dani. She gains status within the group and receives cathartic support from the young women of the commune. This allows her to purge the toxicity she’s experienced at the hands of Christian, his friends, and the outside world.</p><p>Sure, the Bacchae and the Harga are both dangerous, insular, microcosmic communities. Those attributes aside, these are two groups that exist separate from society at large, because their way of life is unique only to them.</p><!--figure[4]--><h2><i>The Allure of Inanimate Objects: Zoé Wittock’s Jumbo vs Ovid’s ‘Pygmalion’</i></h2><p>Another story from Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i> features Cypriot sculptor Pygmalion, who swore off women in his city and took to isolation. In his time away from society, he carved a woman out of ivory and fell in love with it. He prayed to Aphrodite to bring the sculpture to life—and she did! Could this be an early case of objectum sexuality? While there is no divine intervention in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iu1o\"><i>Jumbo</i></a> (which premiered at Sundance this year), Zoé Wittock’s film explores the meaning of objectum sexuality, which is a form of sexual or romantic attraction focused on particular inanimate objects.</p><p>In the film, Jeanne (Noémie Merlant—yes, <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>’s Marianne) isn’t interested in human interaction, other than with her mother Margarette (Emmanuelle Bercot). Working for the cleaning crew at an amusement park, she falls in love with the newest attraction, a tilt-a-whirl ride named Jumbo. As Jeanne’s desire grows, the ride comes to life and begins to communicate via colors and sounds.</p><p>Jeanne is a societal outcast who rejects human romance; her relationship with Jumbo subverts what society understands about sexuality and connection. Coming out to her mother about her attraction is also a challenge. Margarette isn’t open to what her daughter is feeling and reacts harshly toward Jeanne by coercing her into engaging in sex with men, and, when that doesn’t work, throwing her out of the house.</p><p>Eventually, Margarette realizes love is love, and as long as her daughter isn’t hurting anyone, she can learn to accept Jeanne’s love for Jumbo. Being pushed to the fringes of society for being honest (like Jeanne), or isolating yourself (like Pygmalion), is a scenario that queer folks are all too familiar with. At least Jeanne and Pygmalion don’t face tragic ends. The odds of being rejected by loved ones is high.</p><p>Coming out to family members is hard enough, especially when your very existence challenges their sense of normalcy. But this is why chosen families are important, and in both stories, the love of an accepting, chosen few is better than the approval of the majority.</p>"

The results, knotty, seductive and disorienting, are electric.</p><p>Produced by Christine Vachon and Martin Scorsese, <i>Shirley</i> carries hints of Decker’s background in performance art, particularly in Moss’s highly physical performance. Film nuts are still getting to grips with Decker’s singular style, but once you’re in, there’s no way of climbing back out. “Decker finds a way to embody the strange, insoluble, unnerving energy of Jackson’s prose in a film that fittingly always seems to be building to a catastrophic rupture,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jakepcole/film/shirley-2020/\">Jake Cole</a>.</p><p>“I am ready to declare her one of the best modern filmmakers,” writes Letterboxd member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/brianformo/\">Brian Formo</a>, while <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/vshefali/film/shirley-2020/\">Vshefali</a> praises how “Josephine Decker is able to paint a picture of the inside of a woman’s brain so beautifully”. It’s true: Decker is concerned with what makes us tick, but also how the mechanics of that ticking work when nobody’s looking, when everything else has moved on and all that you’re left with are your own loud thoughts.<br/></p><p><b>If you’re based in the US, you can <a href=\"https://neonrated.vhx.tv/buy/letterboxd-presents-shirley\">watch <i>Shirley</i> via our virtual screening room</a>—we’re donating 100 percent of our proceeds to <a href=\"https://www.firelightmedia.tv\">Firelight Media</a>.</b></p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>In the adaptation from the novel, what key elements did you and Sarah Gubbins want to remain true in terms of Shirley Jackson’s story?<br/></b><i>Josephine Decker:</i> We were just really interested in making sure these characters felt like full, rounded individuals. For Shirley and Rose, it was about how they met and entwined. We wanted to really feel their separateness and their togetherness. We spent the most time on how to allow you to really feel each of them deeply, because it’s a hard thing to have a dual-protagonist movie.</p><p><b>What was it about Shirley Jackson that attracted you to her?<br/></b>I came on after it was already scripted. The character is just so witty, and kind of cruel, and complicated and messy. I had loved Sarah’s work on <i>I Love Dick</i>, I thought that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/kathryn-hahn/\">Kathryn Hahn</a>’s performance was one of the great female performances of the last twenty years. She just writes such great characters, so it was exciting to be able to dive into the Shirley that she had created. Also, the real Shirley Jackson is such a complicated and fascinating person—I was and am obsessed with her writing. She does in writing a thing that I’m trying to do in cinema, so it was exciting to get to know her work that well.</p><p><b>What things in her work would you like to emulate?<br/></b>You fall from a real place into an imaginary place without really realising it. She’s very good at sliding you into the character’s mind. It’s a witchy thing that makes her writing feel really exciting, that I haven’t seen that much on screen. I feel like in American cinema there’s this clear line between reality and what’s in your mind, but I think with <i>Shirley</i> that line is very unclear. That’s something I love, that I really pursue in my work and get excited by.</p><p><b>I definitely felt that with <i>Madeline’s Madeline</i> as well, it all feels very slippery.<br/></b>Totally.</p><p><b><i>Shirley</i> is the first feature you’ve directed from another person’s script. How was that experience?<br/></b>It took me a minute to get inside of the world. I’m generally pretty process-oriented, but this film was different. There’s usually a thing that happens as you’re writing, I find I’m writing as an excuse to get the words that are in my head out. So to come from words and try to see the images was a very different experience, but also really exciting. With Sarah’s writing, it was interesting how the space was so important, this house was such a major character in the film. Because it’s such a dialogue-driven script, I worked a lot with the actors in rehearsals. I guess maybe some directors would tell you what to do, and you would start, and you would do that, but I didn’t even realise that would have been an option, so I was like, “Well, we have to make the blocking together” because I was also really adamant that I didn’t want the dialogue to be static.</p><p>It was important to me to sculpt some of the dialogue scenes into movement scenes. It was fun to find the dance of the film and allow the actors to choose their own way through the dialogue. They’re all such geniuses. When we would do rehearsals with Lizzie and Michael, it was so fast, they’re so good at working things out themselves. It was just exciting to let them find their own space and then obviously weigh in when I felt like an outside eye was helpful. I feel like a lot of what I’m realising as a director is if you choose the right collaborators, it’s just about getting out of the way!</p><p><b>How would you describe the relationship between Shirley and Rose? It feels thorny—it reminded me of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/e4uc\">Phantom Thread</a></i> in terms of the toxicity.<br/></b>Generally, Shirley’s own work is about these two female characters who are really different—one is a dark, misanthropic genius, but angry, and the other one is a very light-hearted open spirit who is generous and good at baking and making men happy. I think in her biography there was this idea that these two kinds of women were different aspects of Shirley’s own mind, that she was like both of them. So it was about how different Shirley and Rose are at the beginning, and then that their coming together is such a collision, but then they discover they have a lot to learn from each other and they’re more similar than they realized.</p><p>It was about making sure we could understand their motivations. Especially Rose—she could have been a lighter, less-complex character, but I think I felt really committed, and Odessa did an incredible job, to make her a really full human with her own aspirations. And in the novel too, she has her own world going on. So it’s about making sure her goals are still clear, and then that by the end of the film maybe she has new goals, or maybe she realizes that everything she’d been tidying up her life to get in order—get a husband, have a baby—are maybe a little bit at odds with the deeper thing she’s searching for. But they are really slippery characters.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>You mentioned the importance of the house. <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/616876992554532864/human-resources-kitty-green\">I spoke to Kitty Green recently about <i>The Assistant</i></a> and you share the same composer, Tamar-kali, and sound designer, Leslie Shatz, on your films. Both scores are amazing; on <i>Shirley</i> I’m thinking of the cellos and the violins but then also the creaky floorboards in the sound design. How do you think music and sound help build this world?<br/></b>They’re huge tools. I always think sound design can really bring a new element, especially to a film like this where there’s a slide into a surreal realm, into the mind sometimes. So finding a sound that hints that the things you’re witnessing are a little unreal is exciting. Leslie did a lot of playing. He jokes that when we first met I told him to go to town, and then he just went to town and was like, “I hope I went to the right town!” We had a lot of fun. We tried to really use sounds that weren’t too electronic, stuff that felt like it could have been made with the sound effects that would have been available then. Sound is a huge storyteller, I think it’s more impactful than film. I also think Lizzie’s voice is a train that pushes you through the film, in that you understand where she is with the writing by how confident or how confused that voice is.</p><p><b>What was the first film that made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a46\">Monsters Inc.</a></i>, that one’s easy. I had a real revelation in college while watching it. I’d seen it before, it was my second time, but I just laughed like a little baby. I just have so much fun in these Pixar movies, my best friend in college was watching with me and I was giggling and sitting four feet from the television, and she was just like, “You really like this and I think you should do this and this would be a combination of everything you’ve been doing.” It was helpful to have a friend there to tell me that. I haven’t started making movies like that yet, but maybe someday. My next movie [<i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/nKWU\">The Sky Is Everywhere</a></i>] is a YA film, so if I just keep going younger and younger…</p>"

The hypnotic use of Goldfrapp&rsquo;s ‘Lovely Head’ is probably my favorite use of a song in any film ever. Their drug-fuelled dancing was a massive inspiration for Eddie and Amber’s baby steps into Dublin’s gay scene in <i>Dating Amber</i>.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2Kzu\">Weekend</a></i></b> (2011)<br/><i>Directed by Andrew Haigh</i></p><p>I never fail to cry buckets at the end of this heartbreaking gem. It’s small in the best sense of the word. Two people fall in love over one intimate weekend. Their gayness is both incidental and totally fundamental. It’s so delicate and moving. Andrew Haigh is a master.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1CW4\">But I’m a Cheerleader</a></i></b> (1999)<br/><i>Directed by Jamie Babbit</i></p><p>Jamie Babbit’s debut is a brilliant, campy comedy about a cheerleader sent to a conversion therapy camp. I love it for all the reasons many critics (at the time) disliked it. It is subversive, quirky and defiantly upbeat. And it stars Natasha Lyonne and Clea Duvall. Enough said.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1jzg\">Paris is Burning</a></i></b> (1990)<br/><i>Directed by Jennie Livingston</i></p><p>I’m not saying anything new when I say that <i>Paris is Burning</i> is necessary viewing. It’s a hilarious, moving and eye-opening look at the (mostly) Black trans women in New York’s ball scene. It is a glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary people who risked everything to live authentically, for themselves and each other. And at a time when our trans family is so under attack, it is vital to see such iconic figures from our community. You’ve probably seen it. Re-watch it. Also those end notes will make you cry.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Ha0\">Happy Together</a></i></b> (1997)<br/><i>Directed by Wong Kar-wai</i></p><p>As with all Wong Kar-wai’s work, it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. It’s a tough watch, a portrait of a toxic, failing relationship. But it looks beautiful. They’re miserable and co-dependent. It’s abusive and awful. But it’s great. It really is a great film. I’m not selling this one well. Just watch it.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/d6bE\">Moonlight</a></i></b> (2016)<br/><i>Directed by Barry Jenkins</i></p><p>Definitely worth watching after <i>Happy Together</i>. Not just because it will make you feel better, but because Barry Jenkins has noted it as a big influence. Also, <i>Moonlight</i> is a masterpiece. You know that, of course. Side note: I realize I’ll never be able to create a hand-job scene as powerful and tender as Jenkins did here, but, in <i>Dating Amber</i>, I made three comedy hand-jobs. Take that Jenkins!</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/faZM\">God’s Own Country</a></i></b> (2017)<br/><i>Directed by Francis Lee</i></p><p>You can feel Francis Lee in every frame of this film. It’s personal filmmaking at its very best, with wonderful performances from Josh O’Connor and Alec Secăreanu. And it has the most beautifully romantic ending that you only realize we lack for LGBTQ characters when you see it laid out so wonderfully. When we were trying to finance <i>Dating Amber</i> and people suggested it was too Irish, I’d just reference <i>God’s Own Country</i>, which is so defiantly Yorkshire, and they’d shut up. Also, Secăreanu’s jumper with a thumb hole is my style icon. Bring on <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/kQpQ\">Ammonite</a></i>!</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/e7x4\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a></i></b> (2018)<br/><i>Directed by Marielle Heller</i></p><p>Marielle Heller is such a brilliant filmmaker. This film is based on the memoir by Lee Israel who forged letters by famous people to sell. It’s a genre piece that feels like it could have been made in the 70s. But what I love about it the most is that it is a rare example of a film that centers the friendship between a lesbian and a gay man. Why do films usually treat us like we exist in totally separate worlds? Anyway, it’s a joyous watch.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/9QRe\">Tangerine</a></i></b> (2015)<br/><i>Directed by Sean Baker</i></p><p>I’m obsessed with tightly plotted films and <i>Tangerine</i> doesn’t waste a frame. It’s 88 minutes of pure wit, charm and entertainment in line with the best of old-school Hollywood. You instantly forget that Baker’s film is shot on an iPhone and just get swept up in the extraordinary performances of Mya Taylor and Kitana Kiki Rodriguez. It’s such a mystery they don’t work more. (Reader: it’s not a mystery. It’s because they are Black trans women, and the industry is shit.)</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jkPq\">Portrait of a Lady On Fire</a></i></b> (2019)<br/><i>Directed by Céline Sciamma</i></p><p>We all bow at the alter of Céline Sciamma. This film is perfection. The sparse-but-powerful use of music, exquisite photography and extraordinary performances that burn beneath the stillness. The final shots of Adèle Haenel will feed your soul for a year. (Side note: face masks have never looked so stylish.)</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/OlW\">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a></i></b> (1971)<br/><i>Directed by John Schlesinger</i></p><p>This was John Schlesinger’s follow up to his best-known film, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/25Hi\">Midnight Cowboy</a></i>. A middle-aged gay doctor (Peter Finch), and a divorced woman (Glenda Jackson), are both in an open love triangle with a younger, bisexual sculptor (Murray Head). It’s quite low-key and far tamer now than when it was released, but it’s a beautiful film and Schlesinger’s most personal. He was one of the few openly gay directors of his time. And Jackson’s performance steals it.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1VzS\">Far From Heaven</a></i></b> (2002)<br/><i>Directed by Todd Haynes</i></p><p>Todd Haynes’ stunning film will make you immediately go out and discover all of Douglas Sirk’s glorious technicolor melodramas. Julianne Moore’s performance as a wife who discovers her husband is gay will break you. Dennis Quaid is also terrific as her closeted husband.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/RRc\">The Watermelon Woman</a></i></b> (1996)<br/><i>Directed by Cheryl Dunye</i></p><p>Cheryl Dunye’s low-budget debut is a seminal queer film. A video store worker and documentarian (played by Dunye) starts a new relationship while becoming obsessed with ‘the watermelon woman’, a Black actress forgotten by history. It’s lo-fi, funny and a, far too rare, film about race and sexuality.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UhI\">My Beautiful Laundrette</a></i></b> (1985)<br/><i>Directed by Stephen Frears</i></p><p>It may have been the first time I saw gay characters on screen and, at the time, it petrified me. But what an amazing film about love, acceptance and the power to change. Fun fact: Daniel Day-Lewis spent a year as a tumble dryer in preparation for his role.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1V20\">Beautiful Thing</a></i></b> (1996)<br/><i>Directed by Hettie MacDonald</i></p><p>Hettie MacDonald’s coming-of-age film is so lovely, honest and tender. James Harvey adapted it from his own play of the same name. The soundtrack is almost entirely The Mamas and the Papas. I am surprised some cigar-smoking West-End mogul hasn’t attempted a musical adaptation. Or maybe they have, I don’t know.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/6TwM\">Pride</a></i></b> (2014)<br/><i>Directed by Matthew Warchus</i></p><p>Such a purely entertaining film while being urgent, political and deeply moving. Beresford’s script is a masterclass in plotting and if you don’t cry at the end then you are dead inside. Sorry but that’s just science. Also it has the most emotional postscript coda since, well, <i>Paris is Burning</i>.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/7aRW\">Love is Strange</a></i></b> (2014)<br/><i>Directed by Ira Sachs</i></p><p>Ira Sachs is one of my favorite current filmmakers and criminally underrated. I mean, he’s appreciated, but he needs to be lauded. <i>Love is Strange</i> is such a charming and quietly devastating love story about an older gay couple who lose their apartment and have to couch surf with relatives. It’s one of the most effective films in dealing with the rental crisis in big cities, something he does equally brilliantly in the follow-up, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/cXUq\">Little Men</a></i>.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/fcGi\">A Fantastic Woman</a></i></b> (2017)<br/><i>Directed by Sebastián Lelio</i></p><p>Sebastián Lelio’s film is a beautiful story about one trans woman’s grief after the unexpected death of her older partner. But what makes this film so spectacular is the captivating performance by Daniela Vega. We need to see more of her on screen.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/g796\">BPM (Beats per Minute)</a></i></b> (2017)<br/><i>Directed by Robin Campillo</i></p><p>It’s a film about the AIDS activism of Act Up in 1990s Paris. What makes this so incredible is how joyous it is. Strobe-doused dance scenes punctuate this film that will make you want to take to the streets and fight for your rights.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/cElG\">The Queen of Ireland</a></i></b> (2015)<br/><i>Directed by Conor Horgan</i></p><p>This documentary by Conor Horgan follows Ireland’s most famous drag queen, Panti Bliss (aka Rory O’Neill). It’s about his life, a legal battle (a bunch of homophobes sued Rory for calling them homophobes on national TV) and the staging of a show in his hometown. Central to all this is Ireland’s historic vote on marriage equality, something that Panti was a powerful figure in. If you want to laugh and have your heart soar in seeing confirmation of how a once painfully conservative country moved to love and equality, watch this.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/13f0\">The Kids Are All Right</a></i></b> (2010)<br/><i>Directed by Lisa Cholodenko</i></p><p>Lisa Cholodenko’s feature is a warm, witty and realistic look at a lesbian couple and their children. Every performance is pitch perfect. I can’t believe it’s a decade old and that we have had so few similar films since.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/igNS\">Booksmart</a></i></b> (2019)<br/><i>Directed by Olivia Wilde</i></p><p>We need more joyous films with queer leads and Olivia Wilde’s debut is just that. Set over one night of belated partying, we follow best friends Molly and Amy (Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever), one of whom happens to be a lesbian. It is just so much fun to watch.</p><!--figure[7]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/2b9c\">All About My Mother</a></i></b> (1999)<br/><i>Directed by Pedro Almodóvar</i></p><p>I mean this list could just be an Almodóvar filmography, but <i>All About My Mother</i> just happened to be the first of his I saw and it blew my little gay mind. It’s simply about love in its truest sense. Almodóvar said it best with his dedication, “To all actresses who have played actresses. To all women who act. To men who act and become women. To all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother.”</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Oqk\">Female Trouble</a></i></b> (1974)<br/><i>Directed by John Waters</i></p><p>You can’t have a queer film list without John Waters, and this 1974 classic is my favorite of his. It follows Dawn Davenport (played by the legendary Divine) from teen delinquent to the electric chair. It’s hilarious, irreverent and distasteful in the ways only Waters can be.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/l8QA\">Saint Maud</a></i></b> (2019)<br/><i>Directed by Rose Glass</i></p><p>Rose Glass’s debut film isn’t out yet and so technically shouldn’t be on the list. But I saw at a festival last year and loved it, so there. It’s a horror film about a private nurse (rising star Morfydd Clark) who tries to save the soul of her deviant and lesbian patient (the always-brilliant Jennifer Ehle). It’s eerie, stylish and the sort of debut all us filmmakers wish we had. Shut up, you’re jealous!</p>"

I have also started exploring the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/stats/\">world map feature</a> for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pro/\">Pro and Patron</a> accounts more. And recently I found the <a href=\"https://justwatch.com\">JustWatch</a> partnership to be very helpful when my library got a temporary subscription to Hoopla. I was able to filter what was available for my watchlist and prioritize the titles that weren’t available on other services I have access to.</p><p>But the main reason I keep using my account is that it has made it a whole lot easier to share my <a href=\"https://boxd.it/304WQ\">Netflix DVD queue picks</a> for our shared account with my boyfriend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rwg01/\">Rwg01</a>, whom I talked into making a Letterboxd account. He’s become a self-professed “junior film snob” recently, which has been fascinating to see. Before, I was doing the queue by an email chain and I would forget what I had sent him already, so having a list that I could update regularly without throwing in duplicates, so he could see what I had prioritized, was really helpful for us both!</p><p>I’ve definitely expanded what I’ve watched since I’ve been on Letterboxd. I was not a stranger to non-English movies before, but I’ve watched more in the last year and a half, and I’m not sure if I purposely watched a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4bkUs\">Criterion</a> before then.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>Tell us why you have your current profile four? (We also like the idea of keeping track of your <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5oW3G\">old choices</a>!)<br/></b>I definitely like variety, and since I sprung for a Patron account I didn’t want to look at the same pictures over and over, but of my current four it’s a combination of some old and new favorites.<a href=\"https://boxd.it/aLla\"> <i>North &amp; South</i></a> is a short miniseries—it’s only 4 hours—but I actually prefer it to the 1995 Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle<a href=\"https://boxd.it/g97G\"> <i>Pride and Prejudice</i></a>, which might be sacrilegious. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1720\"><i>Phantom Lady</i></a> is a new favorite that I discovered through the<a href=\"https://boxd.it/4wGu4\"> Old Hollywood Movie Club</a>, which I probably wouldn’t have known about otherwise. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1p7C\"><i>The Thing with Two Heads</i></a> is a cult movie that I need to revisit since I haven’t watched it in a long time, but I leave it on my profile because I think it is worthy to have at least one fan. And<a href=\"https://boxd.it/eAMs\"> <i>Lost in Paris</i></a> is a fun Belgian/French comedy that is a modern homage to Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin.</p><p><b>Take us way back: what was the film that sparked your passion for cinema?<br/></b>This is a really hard question, but the first film I went out and bought memorabilia for was<a href=\"https://boxd.it/2a7a\"> <i>The Mummy</i></a> in 1999. It was a Mummy action figure that included canopic jars. The movie made me want to visit Egypt, and it definitely sparked an appreciation for Rachel Weisz on my part, although the entire cast was fantastic. And one of the first films I bought on DVD was<a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aUc\"> <i>Amélie</i></a>.</p><p><b>Your epic <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/tag/women/lists/\">female filmmaker lists</a> are incredible. How is it humanly possible to curate these lists into the thousands?! Explain your process.<br/></b>Thank you! My first two lists—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/written-by-women/\">Written by Women</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/directed-by-women/\">Directed by Women</a>—actually started from me trying to track what was on my watchlist that I could eventually use for a<a href=\"https://boxd.it/4HQKy\"> personal ‘52 Films by Women’ list</a>, and then I just decided one day to start adding everything, even the Hallmark and Lifetime movies, since people tend to turn their noses up at them. You can see the origins from the Directed by Women list, where it is still in a ‘when added’ order. The other lists came from seeing names and wanting to record them in a list to keep track of them. I used to work in a library, so I guess I just feel a compulsion to catalog things sometimes.</p><p>To be honest, my current curation method is mainly ‘seven degrees of Kevin Bacon’ and stumbling onto women who are working behind the scenes, plus adding the ones I already knew. I’ve also noticed some women from the credits in things that I’ve watched, and have also looked at some festival lineups and indie film release lists for new titles.</p><p>I haven’t had a chance to survey all the award nominee lists and women-oriented film websites yet and I have less free time now, so the lists are definitely still a work in progress. The <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/cinematography-by-women/\">Cinematography</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5lSTC\">Composer</a> lists are still very new. I’ve also had help from other Letterboxd members, and one that I’d like to especially highlight is<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/warped/\"> Warped</a>. She’s added a lot of early women-created films to TMDb and has given me a lot of early names for my Written by Women list.<br/></p><p><b>Please take us on a tour of a few of your favorite craftswomen from each list.<br/></b>I will start off by saying that I’m certainly not an expert in women-created media. My best personal tally is only six percent watched for composers, and the rest vary between one and four percent. As I mentioned earlier, the lists I created mainly started with my watchlist, so I’m still exploring them myself!</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/directed-by-women/\">Directors</a>: I’m currently doing a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3Q3LQ\">5×5 challenge</a> that mostly features women directors, so I imagine my answer will change in the future as I watch more films, but my current favorite woman-directed film is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20zy\"><i>Om Shanti Om</i></a>, directed and written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/farah-khan/\">Farah Khan</a>. It’s very much a Bollywood-savvy film, and I’m still a relative newbie to Indian cinema, but I thought Khan did a wonderful job capturing the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TjUXr560Gu0\">musical numbers</a> and showing the sheer spectacle that sometimes comes with filmmaking. And she had to wrangle all those Bollywood stars, which I imagine was not an easy task. I look forward to revisiting it when I’m “more in the know” about Bollywood.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>As far as other women directors go, I look forward to exploring more of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/agnes-varda/\">Agnès Varda</a>’s filmography, I love <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nora-ephron/\">Nora Ephron</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/penny-marshall/\">Penny Marshall</a>, I’m impressed by the sheer amount of women that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mati-diop/\">Mati Diop</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/dee-rees/\">Dee Rees</a> were apparently able to get to work with them behind the scenes on <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hVEK\"><i>Atlantics</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/eCsu\"><i>Mudbound</i></a>, respectively, and I think award winners and nominees like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jane-campion/\">Jane Campion</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kathryn-bigelow/\">Kathryn Bigelow</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/lina-wertmuller/\">Lina Wertmüller</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/greta-gerwig/\">Greta Gerwig</a> are important to note, along with high box-office earners like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/patty-jenkins/\">Patty Jenkins</a>.</p><p>There are lots of interesting up-and-coming directors like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/lulu-wang/\">Lulu Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/rungano-nyoni/\">Rungano Nyoni</a>, and Letterboxd members like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/margot-gordon/\">Margot Gordon</a>, and there are many wonderful directors on the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3ZVxm\">Official Top 100 Narrative Feature Films by Women Directors</a>, past and present. I am also really enjoying the short-film anthologies by women, like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/l9Ni\"><i>Vai</i></a>. There are also many highly rated women directors that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/46NnC\">need some more views</a>! Three of those underseen ladies whose films I recently enjoyed were <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/antoinette-jadaone/\">Antoinette Jadaone</a>’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5AzK\"><i>Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/tang-shu-shuen/\">Tang Shu Shuen</a>’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4VJ0\"><i>The Arch</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/rebecca-taichman/\">Rebecca Taichman</a>’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hzjU\"><i>Indecent</i></a>. However, none of these ladies would be at the level they are today without the trail-blazing of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/alice-guy-blache/\">Alice Guy-Blaché</a>, who was one of the first people to create a narrative fiction film, and is criminally <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iRH8\">little-known</a>.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/written-by-women/\">Writers</a>: I am a big comedy fan, so, a lot of my favorites have also directed, like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/nora-ephron/\">Nora Ephron</a>, but my current favorites are the aforementioned <i>North &amp; South </i>(source material by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/elizabeth-gaskell/\">Elizabeth Gaskell</a>, with a big hat-tip to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/jane-austen/\">Jane Austen</a>, another favorite, and screenplay co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/sandy-welch/\">Sandy Welch</a>), <a href=\"https://boxd.it/jj4y\"><i>1917</i></a> (co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/krysty-wilson-cairns/\">Krysty Wilson-Cairns</a>), <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7DPK\"><i>Carol</i></a> (source material by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/patricia-highsmith/\">Patricia Highsmith</a> and written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/phyllis-nagy/\">Phyllis Nagy</a>), <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/d2hI\">The Favourite</a></i> (co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/deborah-davis/\">Deborah Davis</a>), <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4p9a\"><i>The Heat</i></a> (written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/katie-dippold/\">Katie Dippold</a>), <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29ks\"><i>Bringing Up Baby</i></a> (source material and co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/hagar-wilde/\">Hagar Wilde</a>), <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29oY\"><i>Singin’ in the Rain</i></a> (co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/betty-comden/\">Betty Comden</a>), <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Qg2\"><i>Tokyo Godfathers</i></a> (co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/keiko-nobumoto/\">Keiko Nobumoto</a>) and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1PFA\"><i>Christmas in Connecticut</i></a> (co-written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/adele-comandini/\">Adele Comandini</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/aileen-hamilton/\">Aileen Hamilton</a>).</p><p>Since many of these were co-written, it’s hard to say which portions come from the ladies, but in general, I find women often write female characters with more depth, they include more emotion and well-rounded romance, and also women are very funny.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/cinematography-by-women/\">Cinematographers</a>: One that was very striking to me recently was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/claire-mathon/\">Claire Mathon</a>’s work in <i>Atlantics</i> [Mathon is also the award-winning cinematographer of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/\"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a>]. She did a great job balancing shots between the characters and the adjacent landscape, I thought, and it was my favorite part of the film. I look forward to seeing more of her work, along with more women cinematographers.</p><p>I also had no idea that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6YK\"><i>Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind</i></a> was filmed by a woman—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/ellen-kuras/\">Ellen Kuras</a>—until recently. Since I haven’t seen it in a very long time I cannot talk about the cinematography right now, but it’s one of my favorite films.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/edited-by-women/\">Editors</a>: It’s hard to have a conversation about women editors without <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/editor/thelma-schoonmaker/\">Thelma Schoonmaker</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/editor/sally-menke-1/\">Sally Menke</a> being mentioned since they have worked with Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino long-term, respectively. RIP Sally Menke, gone too soon. </p><p>A recent editing favorite of mine was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/editor/lidia-zonn/\">Lidia Zonn</a>’s work on Kazimierz Karabasz’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6m20\"><i>The Musicians</i></a>, which was a Criterion find. As a lapsed musician, I really appreciated how she touched upon many of the instruments in her editing when they were featured in the music, and juxtaposed it with the conductor at key moments. It gave a great feel for the movement of the musical piece and the practice overall, although I think the whole crew for that title were beasts. I was unsurprised when I saw that Zonn had at least one sound credit in her filmography because you could tell that she understood the subject matter. One thing that I’ve found doing these lists is that many women wear multiple hats behind the scenes.</p><p>I’d also like to mention Midge Costin’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/lXug\"><i>Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound</i></a>. I considered having a list for sound editors and mixers after watching that documentary, but I decided that it would be too hard to find data. I may change my mind in the future. Costin features interviews with several women in the field, in addition to giving a really good overview to sound engineering. I highly recommend it if you are interested in film production.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/composed-by-women-women-lyricists/\">Composers and songwriters</a>: I am still discovering women movie composers—if you know of some, give me a holler! But I have assigned myself works from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/tamar-kali/\">Tamar-kali</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/hildur-gunadottir/\">Hildur Guðnadóttir</a>. However, I have seen several movies that feature music by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/rachel-portman/\">Rachel Portman</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/anne-dudley/\">Anne Dudley</a>, who have been the most prolific composers I’ve found so far.</p><p>Out of the composers nominated for the 2020 Oscars, I had only seen <i>1917</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>, so I can’t really comment on the competition as a whole, but it’s always nice to see women get recognized in very male-heavy fields. As of right now, it seems like there are fewer women composers—at least to me—than the other major behind-the-scenes movie roles, so that makes Guðnadóttir&rsquo;s Oscar win for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/joker-2019/\"><i>Joker</i></a> even more notable, especially since she won as a solo composer.</p><!--figure[7]--><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/top-150-highest-rated-women-directed-documentaries/\">Documentaries from women directors</a>:<b> </b>My current favorites directed by women either bring light to women’s issues or highlight a woman I either hadn’t heard of or didn’t know much about their life. Some favorites are <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/rayka-zehtabchi/\">Rayka Zehtabchi</a>’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/j2oQ\"><i>Period.

The <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/written-by-frances-marion\">Criterion Channel</a> is currently screening fifteen of her films plus a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6ahi\">documentary</a> about her, so I plan to pig out when I have a chance. When women were largely shut out of filmmaking in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s in Hollywood, editors like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/editor/anne-bauchens/\">Anne Bauchen</a>, the first woman Oscar nominee and winner for Film Editing—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/editor/adrienne-fazan/\">Adrienne Fazan</a> for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gigi/\"><i>Gigi</i></a>—and the first woman editor in Hollywood, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/editor/viola-lawrence/\">Viola Lawrence</a>, were still working behind the scenes, along with many women screenwriters, and the few directors like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/dorothy-arzner/\">Dorothy Arzner</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ida-lupino/\">Ida Lupino</a>.

What does that indicate to you?<br/></b>I honestly think a lot of recency bias has to do with easy availability and how people consume media, and also current publicity cycles. Media conglomerates tend to focus on what’s new and hot or popular, and older titles often get dropped in favor of the new—they mainly are concerned with volume, subscribers, and clicks. If people never see something offered to begin with, they may never come across it. Also, some titles get the label of “not commercially viable” on them, so they never get a wide distribution from the get-go. Typically, we all tend to go for what’s convenient, and unfortunately some interesting and worthy things will drop through the cracks.</p><p>For example, the reason I am a weirdo and have a shared Netflix DVD plan is that frankly, what I want to watch is often not available to stream. I also like special features, and those are hardly ever included for streaming. </p><!--figure[9]--><p><b>You haven’t logged <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> yet! We hope you plan to see it soon. How do you feel about its legacy and impact on Letterboxd?<br/></b>I need <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20GE\"><i>Highlander</i></a> to become reality, because I really have too many things slated to watch and I am definitely behind on 2019 releases. I was happy when <i>Portrait</i> made it to Hulu and it’s definitely on my mental list, even more so after I saw <i>Atlantics</i>. Technically, it’s on my <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4ngBA\">Film School Dropouts list</a>. I promise I will see it eventually!</p><p>I’m pleased that it is so highly rated on Letterboxd, although there are some things that have women behind the scenes that are rated even higher! I think a lot of people think of media by and about women as being slight, less important, or just plain bad. I think it’s wrong to paint everything with women creators or about women with that brush, because it is clearly not true, no matter how much some people would like it to be that way.</p><p><b>You’ve participated in many <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/tag/challenge/lists/\">challenges</a>. How do you find the ones you want to participate in?<br/></b>I’ve sorta stopped focusing on challenges as much recently due to limited time and have been spending a little more time on Letterboxd film clubs—<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thefilmclub/\">Film Club</a> and the aforementioned <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4wGu4\">Old Hollywood Movie Club</a>—but usually what I look for is a challenge that will expand my viewing in some way, or will help me tackle my watchlist. Or they just seem like fun.</p><p>Some people who have created and continued some great challenges other than the aforementioned <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/buzzybhn/\">Buzzybhn</a> are: Jason Tucker’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/49nKw\">Comedy Challenge</a>; various challenges by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kynky/\">kynky</a>; the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/qOXg\">Scavenger Hunt</a>, hosted by different people each month, maintained by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lastcooldude/\">Wood</a>; Joakim’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4KB28\">Age of Cage</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/paperinukke/tag/apwill-dafoeth/lists/\">Apwill Dafoeth</a> challenges; Lise’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4vvjW\">March Around the World</a>; Steve Geiler’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4lV0w\">Film School Dropouts</a>; Benjamin Milot’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2VlLA\">Letterboxd Season Challenge</a>; El Cinemonster’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2Rcp8\">Hooptober</a>; DBC’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4obY2\">Animation</a> challenge; Lia’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5etVa\">Zodiac/Cast Chart</a>; Kyle Armstrong’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4gqJ6\">Documentary</a> challenge.</p><p>There are tons of other challenges out there, so if you have an interest in something, chances are someone has come up with a challenge. I listed many more <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lise/list/march-around-the-world-2020-brazil/#comment-5602319\">here</a>, and I’ve found challenges before by using the list sub-search.</p><p><b>What were some of the best film discoveries you’ve made thanks to a Letterboxd challenge?<br/></b>Just recently, I got around to watching <a href=\"https://boxd.it/kIjK\"><i>Love, Antosha</i></a>, and I would’ve never thought a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4RKAi\">Nicolas Cage Challenge</a> would’ve exposed me to such a sucker-punch of a film. [Editor’s note: read our interview with <i>Love, Antosha</i> <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/189023744998/love-anton-garret-price\">director Garret Price</a>.]</p><p><b>And which have been the most difficult or impossible challenges so far?<br/></b>I rarely finish challenges, so they are all approaching impossible, ha ha. I mainly use them to spice up what I watch. But I think it will take me some time to finish my <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4NkCO\">World Project</a> and the Fam(ily) Challenge I made up since they have 100+ movies. And I will diligently chip away on my <a href=\"https://boxd.it/43MeS\">Watchlist Project</a>, but that will probably never end. Also, theoretically, the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/43iP0\">Showdown Challenge</a> won’t be ending, either, I assume. No pressure!</p><p><b>Which movie that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4RjRc\">you fell asleep to</a> have you vowed to give a second chance?<br/></b>I will eventually revisit all the ones I haven’t finished, even <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1FXE\"><i>Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern are Dead</i></a>, but the one I was genuinely interested in while watching it was <a href=\"https://boxd.it/mSas\"><i>Superman: Red Son</i></a>. I was just really tired that day.</p><p><b>You can keep one <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/cats-3/\">cinematic cat</a>. Who do you take home?<br/></b>Ah! You are evil! I guess I will pick Catbus from <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/20eA\">My Neighbor Totoro</a>,</i> if I can only pick one, but I have to give special props to the cats in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aYS\"><i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</i></a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iNoQ\"><i>Diamantino</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1NZo\"><i>The Scarlet Flower</i></a> for being so chill in the face of adversity.</p><!--figure[10]--><p><b>What’s the most underrated film according to Letterboxd average rating? (And tell us why we’re wrong.)<br/></b>I actually think <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7TS6\"><i>London Fields</i></a> isn’t as bad as people have rated it, but I think I saw the better edit. Try the DVD version on for size! The ending is still somewhat questionable, in my opinion.</p><p><b>Which film ranks the highest on your list of shame?<br/></b>Oh, I haven’t seen a lot of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3Wrws\">popular</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3WtBO\">highly rated</a> movies, but according to my boyfriend, I should feel most shameful about not seeing <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2baO\"><i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i></a>. The thing is, I think I have seen it, but I can’t remember for sure.  </p><p><b>You’ve collaborated with our team to add many <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aobh/list/backdrops-added/\">backdrops</a> that we were missing. Why do you feel it’s important that each film has its own artwork?<br/></b>Sometimes the poster can give a good sense of the film, but sometimes it does not. If you are looking for something interesting to watch, a backdrop might sway you. Also, if you are a Patron member, having backdrops for your profile, lists, and reviews is nice. I also have to give a shoutout to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1NbpY\">Kevin Almroth</a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1fJoC\">Drew</a> for their lists and guidance about backdrops, and of course the Letterboxd team for handling the requests!</p><p><b>What’s a feature you wish Letterboxd had?<br/></b>I was actually talking to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/karmstrongkta/\">Kyle Armstrong</a> about sorting for two genres at once last year for a genre challenge, but I don’t know how easy that would be to implement. I’d also love to be able to sort lists by popularity while editing, rather than having to sort them after publication. But I was happy when I got an email recently that stated the ‘uploading your own avatar image to the site’ feature request that I had voted on was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/settings/avatar/\">now live</a>.</p><p><b>Which three members not mentioned yet should we all be following?<br/></b>I follow a lot of interesting, well-written and funny people, but others I’d like to mention are <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/voicelikehoney/\">Olivia</a>, who purposely subjects herself to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3UbYQ\">low-rated movies</a>—one day I will get her to watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4pv6\"><i>Panman</i></a>—as well as classics, and is the only person I’ve seen who regularly <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3ROdS\">writes poetry</a> as part of her reviews. She also runs a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3UOVc\">Chain Reaction</a> challenge. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/reibureibu/\">Reibureibu</a>, who watches a variety of movies on their three monitors and reviews all of them very thoughtfully, and also has a helpful list that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/42xYk\">links some major award winners in the Western World</a>. And Old Hollywood Maven, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/meerkate/\">Meerkate</a>, who has <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5eqFy\">several</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/meerkate/tag/women-in-film-noir/lists/\">interesting</a> <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2R2SY\">lists</a> in addition to her reviews. For those of you in the US, she has a <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4ST3O\">Census in the movies list</a>, which I think is neat and very timely. Go fill it out!</p>"

Just as cinephiles flocked to <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/613161636990205952/the-curve-contagion\">Steven Soderbergh’s <i>Contagion</i> as the coronavirus pandemic began to spread</a>, viewings of the likes of Ava DuVernary’s documentary <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/13th/\"><i>13th</i></a>, Spike Lee’s magnum opus <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/do-the-right-thing/\"><i>Do the Right Thing</i></a> and Raoul Peck’s elegiac James Baldwin essay film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/i-am-not-your-negro/\">I Am Not Your Negro</a>—</i>along with more films focused on Black experience, history and protest—have spiked in viewing and review numbers in the past fortnight.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/malcolm-x-1992/\"><i>Malcolm X</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/selma/\"><i>Selma</i></a>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/daughters-of-the-dust/\">Daughters of the Dust</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gQyg\">The Hate U Give</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/gGhu\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/iXj2\">Just Mercy</a>,</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fruitvale-station/\"><i>Fruitvale Station</i></a>, and more are all enjoying an undeniable surge of viewership—in some cases, an increase of a thousand percent over their historical viewership numbers. And a matching rise in the number of reviews gives us insight into the feelings, or sense of catharsis, people are seeking from these films. Here, we take a survey of recent reactions to the top five—followed by suggestions for digging deeper.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/elNg\">13th</a></i> </b>(2016)<br/><i>Directed by Ava DuVernay</i></p><p>At the time of writing, <i>13th</i> was the current most popular film by volume of activity on Letterboxd. (Within 24 hours of its release, Spike Lee’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/lnXw\">Da 5 Bloods</a></i> jumped into the top spot, with <i>13th</i> now in second place.) It’s easy to see why Letterboxd members gravitated to the film—Ava DuVernay’s 2016 documentary on the loophole of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which effectively allows slavery in the modern day, is comprehensive and convincing.</p><p>Built around interviews with a number of Black academics and a thorough history of Jim Crow laws through to modern-day mass incarceration in the US, it’s an important and effective primer for anyone looking for a basic comprehension of new methods of oppression from the state. Part of the film’s power comes from, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thejoshl/film/13th/\">as member and film critic Josh Lewis puts it</a>, “the way DuVernay sequences this, the way she moves us through the major events, records and timelines with passion and anger, allowing Black voices and art to naturally narrate”.</p><p>As with a number of films from the last decade that examine Black protest, there’s a juxtaposition between modern imagery and rhetoric, and systemic racism from a history that America too often insists it has left behind. It makes clear the repetition of this history of oppression for Black Americans with powerful editing, as DuVernay organizes archive footage from the past through to the present day to emphasise this point.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29gA\">Do The Right Thing</a></b></i> (1989)<br/><i>Directed by Spike Lee</i></p><p>It could be said that the recognition of this repetition is part of why these particular films have proven so popular in recent weeks. Perhaps the most significant part of the engagement with older work like Spike Lee’s (arguably best) film <i>Do The Right Thing</i>, is that the imagery hasn’t aged. As Ashley Clark says in <a href=\"https://time.com/5847912/movies-to-watch-about-racism-protests/\">a recent piece for <i>Time</i> on films about Black history and protest</a>, “…it’s amazing to see those patterns repeat now, specifically in the discourse of people focusing more on the destruction of property than on lives that are lost”. <i>Do The Right Thing</i>’s palpable anger and unending relevance make it one of the best fictional films to watch right now, if not <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tedmarsden/film/do-the-right-thing/\">for understanding and empathy</a> (“I have a lot of empathizing to do,” Letterboxd member <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1clP7Z\">Ted</a> agrees), then for some kind of catharsis.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><a href=\"https://boxd.it/27WE\"><i><b>Malcolm X</b></i></a><b> </b>(1992)<br/><i>Directed by Spike Lee</i></p><p>It’s not just <i>Do The Right Thing</i> either—even just going off the numbers, Spike Lee is a go-to name when it comes to engaging with Black people’s history in America and in American film. He’s been engaging with these subjects of protest and anguish for the longest time, and there are few such prolific directors in the way he broaches the subject, crossing the line back and forth between fiction and non-fiction, readily blending the two together in many cases.</p><p>That status feels evident in the corresponding surges of popularity for <i>Malcolm X</i>, one of his most acclaimed works, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blackkklansman/\"><i>BlacKkKlansman</i></a>, one of his most recent. His latest work, the excellent, galvanizing war drama <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/da-5-bloods/\"><i>Da 5 Bloods</i></a> (streaming on Netflix now), acts as a reminder that institutional racism is not just a symptom of the current establishment, but something deeply embedded in American ideology. It’s a multimedia examination of the overlap of racism and imperialism, its arguments backed up by clips of Angela Davis, Kwame Ture, Muhammad Ali and of course Malcolm X. </p><p><i>Malcolm X</i> is a valuable watch in that it provides a loving and complex portrait of a man often vilified by white liberals as much as white conservatives, an example of the ‘wrong’ way to protest or take action. It’s a counterpoint to the reductive and often-held perspective of the man, who is often presumed to have stood in opposition to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It’s a humanist portrait of a man constantly changing, one brought to life by, as Jaime Rebenal writes, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jaimerebanal/film/malcolm-x-1992/5/\">“one of cinema’s very finest performances”</a> from Denzel Washington (whom, I must reinforce, was truly robbed of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Academy_Awards#Awards\">that Oscar</a>). A long film, but not a minute wasted.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/8jak\"><b>Selma</b></a></i> (2014)<br/><i>Directed by Ava DuVernay</i></p><p>On the flip-side of this is Ava DuVernay’s <i>Selma</i>, which paints an equally complicated portrait of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., focusing on the organized action that lead to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. “As sobering as it is galvanizing” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/film/selma/\">Letterboxd member and correspondent Ella Kemp</a>.<i> Selma</i>’s vision of MLK was of a complicated man, one steadfast in his commitment to peaceful resistance and protest for civil rights, but still a man as opposed to a saint.</p><p>I could talk at length about that supposed saintliness being thrown back in the faces of Black people, as well as the gossip compounded by American institutions to discredit the man’s work—DuVernay and David Oyelowo’s interpretation of MLK saves me that time.</p><p>All beautifully lensed by the—at that point—upcoming cinematographer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/bradford-young/\">Bradford Young</a> (whose subsequent credits include <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/aNGk\">Arrival</a> </i>and <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/bGWs\">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a></i>), and with typically gorgeous costume design from <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/8MHs\">Black Panther</a> </i>Oscar-winner <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/costumes/ruth-e-carter/\">Ruth E. Carter</a> (a long-time associate of Spike Lee), it’s a visual treat as well.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/etXy\"><b>I Am Not Your Negro</b></a></i> (2016)<br/><i>Directed by Raoul Peck</i></p><p><i>I Am Not Your Negro</i>, Raoul Peck’s documentary-slash-adaptation of the unpublished James Baldwin memoir, provides a similar juxtaposition between America’s past racism and its present. Narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, words from Baldwin’s unfinished manuscript ‘Remember This House’ explore American anti-Blackness through a mixture of archival footage and anecdotes from Baldwin, as he recounts the lives of his civil rights leader friends Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Medgar Evers and others.</p><p>As with many other Letterboxd reviews, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/daisoujou/film/i-am-not-your-negro/\">Daisoujou reflects</a> on the persistence of state-sponsored racism, writing that it’s “a movie that feels like it was made yesterday, based on writings from roughly the 80s, which also feel written yesterday, in the most depressing way”. A lot of identifying with films detailing Black protest is to recognize this cycle, the seeming neverending-ness of it all; that engagement with racism is not just something occurring in the present moment but something that carries the weight of history, at all times.</p><!--figure[6]--><p>These are all strong starting points for the beginning of an empathy with Black protest, struggle, history and art on film. But it’s just scratching the surface. The five films above mostly skew towards the recent, when there’s a long and exceptional history of Black cinema.</p><p>It’s important to consider the expansiveness of Black art, that not all of it is about our tragedies, there’s more to witness than our pain, and this deserves attention after crisis as well. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/over-100-years-of-black-defiance-at-the-movies\">K. Austin Collins’ introduction for his <i>Vanity Fair</i> list says it best:</a> “Black defiance on-screen is bigger than <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, however. Black defiance (including but not limited to outright protest), Black anger, Black art: These are vast territories.” As Collins’ excellent two-part list states, the history of our representation and the self-determination of our on-screen legacies of course goes far beyond just the work of Spike Lee and Ava DuVernay.</p><p>You could watch Cheryl Dunye’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-watermelon-woman/\"><i>The Watermelon Woman</i></a> for a film examining just that: how the narrow idea of ‘representation’ has failed so many, that their own histories have to be invented, and how Black people often have to deal with art’s frequent rejection of their own image.</p><p>You could watch the work of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kathleen-collins-1/\">Kathleen Collins</a>, you could watch <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/paris-is-burning/\"><i>Paris is Burning</i></a> for a history of New York City ballrooms and drag culture (and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/paris-is-burning-documentary-drag-jennie-livingston-interview\">here’s K. Austin Collins again</a> with a recent re-reading of that film, in conversation with its white director). The history of Black Britishness also often gets left at the wayside—both Collins and Clark recommend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/handsworth-songs/\"><i>Handsworth Songs</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blacks-britannica/\"><i>Blacks Britannica</i></a> for pictures of Black thought and struggle in the context of Thatcher’s Britain (and many more in their aforementioned lists, both well worth checking out).</p><p>The protests have also, naturally, lead to conversations around representation of Black people across media, in front of and behind the camera. Such discovery is both vital and easier than ever, as the protests have inspired artists and streaming sites to make their library of work more accessible—among those, the Criterion Channel, having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criterionchannl/status/1268982646698323968\">dropped the paywall for much of its collection focusing on Black lives</a>.</p>"

His movie follows in the footsteps of legendary documentaries such as Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper’s 1991 film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hearts-of-darkness-a-filmmakers-apocalypse/\">Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse</a></i>, which revealed the full extent of the already infamous insanity that comprised the making of Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 classic <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/apocalypse-now/\">Apocalypse Now</a>, </i>and used extensive footage shot at the time by Coppola’s filmmaker wife Eleanor (filmmaker spouses are handy to have along for the ride, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/99km\">as Nicolas Winding Refn also knows</a>). And there’s Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe’s 2002 work <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lost-in-la-mancha/\">Lost in La Mancha</a></i>, which detailed Terry Gilliam’s (ironically?) Sisyphean efforts to film an adaptation of <i>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.</i></p><p>In both instances, the films in question were (<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote/\">eventually</a>) made—and released to some acclaim (one considerably more than the other)—but as <i>The Ghost of Peter Sellers</i> shows, the shooting of <i>Ghost in the Noonday Sun</i> was such an epic boondoggle that the unfinished film sat unreleased for years and was much later released to no acclaim whatsoever.</p><p>The uphill battle to make his never-released horror movie <i>Northwestern</i> made indie filmmaker Mark Borshadt an unlikely filmmaking hero thanks to the breakout success of Chris Smith’s 1999 documentary <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-movie/\">American Movie</a></i>. Like with <i>Ghost in the Noonday Sun</i>, the efforts to make a film proved more interesting than the film being made.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>There are several narrative films of note that have successfully captured the specific pandemonium of filmmaking. Richard Rush’s 1980 cult classic <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-stunt-man/\">The Stunt Man</a></i> follows a fugitive who stumbles his way into the titular job on a big chaotic Hollywood production (Peter O’Toole plays the Machiavellian director), while Christopher Guest’s under-appreciated 1989 comedy <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-picture/\">The Big Picture</a></i> stars Kevin Bacon as a hot young director who is roughed up by the Hollywood machine. It’s a notable and often overlooked antecedent to <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-player/\">The Player</a></i>, and like the Robert Altman classic, is more about ‘the business’ overall than the specifics of filmmaking, although in both cases Hollywood proves itself analogically appropriate.</p><p>Playwright, writer and director David Mamet’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/david-mamet-1/\">own filmmaking experiences</a> obviously inform his 2000 comedy <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/state-and-main/\">State and Main</a></i>, in which a Hollywood production takes over and smothers a small town with its singular thinking. It’s not hard to imagine Mamet processing his own filmmaking trauma in <i>State and Main</i>, just as the Coen brothers famously did in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/barton-fink/\">Barton Fink</a></i>, their ode to writer’s block supposedly inspired by the difficulty they had penning the screenplay for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/millers-crossing/\">Miller’s Crossing</a>.</i></p><!--figure[3]--><p>Charlie Kaufman channeled his own creative struggles into the screenplay for the 2002 masterpiece <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/adaptation/\">Adaptation</a></i>, then built on those themes with his wildly ambitious 2008 directorial debut <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/synecdoche-new-york/\">Synecdoche, New York</a>,</i> whose more maddening aspects arguably capture the irrational nightmare that is filmmaking better than any film directly ‘about’ filmmaking.</p><p>With her 2018 documentary <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shirkers/\"><i>Shirkers</i></a>, writer Sandi Tan gained some measure of closure regarding an indie film she had   starred in and written in her home country of Singapore, in 1992. The documentary (which shares its name with the original movie) has her revisiting the footage from the never-released film, which was stolen (!) 25 years previously by its director—and Tan’s filmmaking mentor—George Cardona.</p><p>Back to Peter Medak. In <i>The Ghost of Peter Sellers</i>, which premiered at Telluride Film Festival in 2018 and has just had its virtual screening release, we learn that Hungarian-born Medak was a rising directing star in the early 1970s in London, hot off the Oscar-nominated Peter O’Toole film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-ruling-class/\">The Ruling Class</a></i>. Unable to resist an offer to work with Peter Sellers, then comedy’s reigning superstar—mostly thanks to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-pink-panther-original-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\">Blake Edwards’ <i>Pink Panther</i> films</a>—Medak set about shooting a treasure-hunting pirate film on the island nation of Cyprus in the Mediterranean.<br/></p><p>In addition to the usual production problems associated with shooting on boats, Medak had to contend with the titanically and infamously fickle Sellers, who quickly turned on him and attempted to get him fired. Sellers also antagonized the other actors, then, after failing to get the production shut down, brought in his friend and longtime creative collaborator Spike Milligan to try and salvage the film, but things kept going wrong, leaving <i>Ghost in the Noonday Sun </i>unfinished and Medak with the blame for the production’s troubles.<br/></p><!--figure[4]--><p>Although Medak’s career recovered, he has clearly been carrying around a lot of hurt associated with the experience, and it’s remarkable watching him work through that on screen by revisiting Cyprus, telling the story of the shoot, and talking to some of the people involved. Sellers (who died in 1980) looms large over the film, but it also has interesting content surrounding the great Spike Milligan, who died in 2002.</p><p><b>Why did you decide to revisit this experience with a documentary?</b><br/><i>Peter Medak:</i> Because it’s been haunting me for all these years. Because it should’ve been a really very successful film and I was blamed for everything going wrong, when in fact it had nothing to do with me. It was due to Peter’s changing mind and state of mind, and all kinds of things had physically gone wrong on the film. It was always easiest to blame the director for everything and my career at the time was very high up after <i>[The] Ruling Class </i>and this should’ve been the icing on the cake and it wasn’t.</p><p>It really bothered me for many years afterwards, even though I went on working. I was asked to do it by the producer of the documentary and I originally said “It’s the last thing I want to do”, because it would mean I would have to go back to Cyprus where I shot the original movie and go on the water, and I never want anything to do with water anymore because a lot of the disasters on the film, production-wise, were all connected with shooting at sea, which is totally impossible to do. Then I thought: well, you know, I should just do it and try to explain what happened on the film. And because some of the explanations were funnier scenes than the original film. So that’s why I did it.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>In the documentary, you talk about needing to free yourself from the experience by making this film. Do you feel like you achieved that?</b><br/>Well, I think I did because I had a wonderful time doing it. A very sad time at the same time because when you go back to places where you shot 45 years before, it creates a very strange kind of illusion inside your mind, your heart and everything of the time. And having been there then and then being there again, it’s a very strange kind of a supernatural feeling in a way. It felt like you have died and your ghost is actually revisiting all these things you know. I called it <i>The Ghost of Peter Sellers </i>because it sounds good and also because the original film was called <i>Ghost in the Noonday Sun</i>, and this ghostly feeling of mine of revisiting that island after all these years, it’s a very, very strange feeling and somehow the film captures that emotionally.</p><p><b>Do you feel like the large distance from the shoot was necessary to be able to revisit it?</b><br/>It’s not that I thought about it every day of my life, but I talked about it to all the people who I worked with in my following career. When I was doing <i>Romeo Is Bleeding</i> with Gary Oldman, my darling Gary said to me one day, “You know, we are crazy, what we should do is make a movie about your movie, but I don’t want to play Peter Sellers, I want to play you, with your Hungarian, broken-English accent.” We had a script written but we never did it. That was a good 25 years ago.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>So you had considered doing a scripted version of it?<br/></b>Yeah, but I don’t know quite what we would’ve done. I said to Gary at the time: “I never want to go on a boat again”, and so I thought in my mind that the scenes would start each day [with] the characters getting off the pirate ship and they come ashore—that’s where the scenes would begin. I’m sure we would’ve done something quite wonderful, and it would’ve   maybe   explained the things the [documentary is] trying to explain because I guess that’s what has unconsciously driven me. Because [for the documentary], we didn’t write one word of it, I just completely did it out of instinct. Where I want to shoot, what I want to shoot, and how we should go from here to there. I loved it, so going back on to it was quite easy. It did show me actually what a wonderful medium it is, documentary, because you can do anything with it. It’s a much freer form than scripted movies. Which is rigid. And this is liquid.</p><p><b>Did you have any other documentaries about filmmaking in mind when you went into this?<br/></b>Not really. I knew Terry Gilliam’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lost-in-la-mancha/\">Lost in La Mancha</a></i>, because I love Terry and I love his films and we know each other and knew each other. Terry was very fortunate, because he had so much trouble before on <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adventures-of-baron-munchausen/\">Baron Munchausen</a></i>, that he decided to have a documentary film crew filming the whole process, so he had the material available, which allowed him to make his film. I said to him after [a screening], “You were lucky because you didn’t make the movie. I had to suffer through 90-something days of shooting with Peter [Sellers].” But of course since then, Terry made <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote/\">the film</a>, and he made something slightly different than what he was originally gonna do.</p><!--figure[7]--><p><b>Did any of your subsequent films feel nearly as difficult?<br/></b>Most movies are very difficult to make, and always when you anticipate problems, they never seem to happen. When I did <i>The Changeling</i>, everybody said “George C. Scott is very, very difficult to work with” and he was an absolute angel with me and [it was] the easiest thing to do. It was a wonderful ghost story. I’m very proud of that film. It will live forever. All movies are like your kids, your own children, because you put so much emotion, so much of your soul. That’s what I’m saying to [<i>Ghost in the Noonday Sun</i> executive producer] John Heyman [in <i>The Ghost of Peter Sellers</i>]: the director’s viewpoint is completely different from the producer’s because every frame you set up references yourself and your entire life, so bits and pieces indirectly of your life go into every movie. Because of that it becomes an incredibly personal journey when you put your absolute soul on the line. When it gets criticized or not accepted or whatever, one takes it very personally because the whole thing came from a very personal experience, even though the subject may be nothing to do with you.</p><!--figure[8]--><p><b>Even within the canon of famously difficult performers, Peter Sellers is notorious. How would you describe him to a modern audience?<br/></b>Well he was a genius, there’s no question about it. But he was a manic-depressive person. And it’s a generalization, but most of the great comics are manic-depressive. And he changes his mind all the time. One minute, he loves you, next minute, he hates you. One minute he loves the subject, next minute he doesn’t wanna do it, he wants to get out and all that. So it is very up and down. When you’re running film with a crew of 150 people, and boats on the sea, and weather’s changing and everything, you can’t have that, because you fall behind the schedule and things go wrong. </p><p>At one point very early on, all he wanted to do was get off the movie. And then he did everything he [could] to sabotage the film so the film would close down and he wouldn’t have to finish it. But it didn’t just happen on my film, it happened with all his biggest successes, including the <i>Pink Panther </i>movies. Because if you look into Blake Edwards, each one was an absolute nightmare for the director and for the film company, United Artists. And I was gonna include that in the documentary but it had nothing to do with the <i>Ghost in the Noonday Sun</i> so I didn’t. I actually shot some scenes with one of the executives from United Artists at that time who had to deal with the insanity of Peter and also Blake Edwards. I say ‘insanity’; I didn’t want to say it too much in the documentary because I love Peter, even today. And it’s wrong for me to accuse him of those things because it sounds like I’m excusing myself. Peter <i>was </i>crazy. There’s no other way one can describe it. Touched by God. And so was Spike Milligan. But Spike had the love of goodness. Peter had kind of a nasty streak on him when he turned on people.</p><p><b>There’s a moment in the documentary where you suggest that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/spike-milligan/\">Spike Milligan</a> is more influential than he gets credit for. Do you think he’s under-appreciated?<br/></b>Totally. Totally. Totally. Because his talent was absolutely, monumentally genius. I always say this, but Spike basically created Peter Sellers through [legendary BBC radio programme] <i>The Goon Show</i>. And he also gave him all those various characters and developed those voices for him. It’s all in <i>The Goon Show</i>. The Monty Pythons, they were inspired by <i>The Goon Show </i>and they made it into television. Not story wise, but style wise. That kind of zany, insane humor. Spike was a total genius. Not that Peter wasn’t, but they stood together, completely overwhelmingly wonderfully insane. But Spike was quite something. He was incredibly human, he was incredibly gentle. And incredibly kind. Peter was incredibly combative. And he had that most incredible ego.</p><p>But all our lives come from our backgrounds and what our past was and where we come from, and Peter had a very sad upbringing and a very sad life and he was tremendously influenced by his mother. When his mother passed away, he kept on talking to her for ten years. When he came to Cyprus to make the movie, he arrived with big blow-up [photos] of Liza Minnelli—who he’d just broken up with a week before—and his mum.   And it sounds terrible when one says it, but psychologically, some of the answers are there. But at the same time, both Peter and Spike, I can’t tell you what a gift it was… I mean the reason I did the film is: who could give up the chance of actually working with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan? It doesn’t matter what the fucking script is, you know? It was a wonderful thing and I would do it all over again tomorrow.</p>"

Everyone agrees that the film wears its influences on its sleeve.  <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chainsawmasacre/film/arkansas/\">Chainsaw Massacre</a>  “loved nearly every minute of this deliberately paced descendant of Tarantino and the Coen brothers. [But] comparing it to those […] filmmakers does it a disservice though, because, while you can feel their influence, first-time director Clark Duke does have his own distinct style”.</p><p>While noting that it marks another interesting performance in Vaughn’s recent emergence as a worthy cinematic lowlife, Tummis <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dreamingoffilm/film/arkansas/\">would also</a><b> </b>“like to point out that Liam Hemsworth was great in this”.</p><p><i>Arkansas </i>is available via various digital outlets, as indicated on its <a href=\"https://www.lionsgate.com/movies/arkansas\">official website</a>.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/what-she-said-the-art-of-pauline-kael/\">What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael</a><br/></b>Directed by Rob Garver</i></p><p>Before the Letterboxd era, film criticism was a much more exclusive realm, and no one critic loomed larger in that realm than <i>The New Yorker</i>’s Pauline Kael—so iconic that true cineastes of her time referred to her simply by her first name. So it behooves you, good Letterboxd member, to familiarize yourself with this master of the form via this new documentary.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kmarus/film/what-she-said-the-art-of-pauline-kael/\">a review</a> that feels like it could apply to any number of Letterboxd members, kmarus says “From what I’ve encountered of her criticism, Kael and I disagree on a lot of things, but one thing that is readily apparent to anyone who reads her writing is that she genuinely cares about movies”. </p><p>Letterboxd’s London correspondent (and professional critic) Ella Kemp <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/film/what-she-said-the-art-of-pauline-kael/\">felt personally validated</a> watching the film. “It’s magic, she’s magic, this is why we needed her and why we always need movies, and why I want to keep talking about them. It’s nice if you read me, if you like me or if you agree with me—but even if you don’t, I know I’ll be sticking around for a while anyway.

As member Andrew Chrzanowski <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/v9733xa/film/slay-the-dragon/\">ominously intones</a>, the film is “never more timely than right here and right now” and “demands you to watch, so you may witness in a comprehensive and detailed way the metastasis of the most malignant cancer on our democracy: gerrymandered districts and redrawn borders by Republicans, especially after the 2010 elections”.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/guyatthemovies/film/slay-the-dragon/\">Guyatthemovies says</a> the film “does a phenomenal job of taking a topic that may seem confusing for most who are not familiar and breaking it down to simplistic terms, explaining the impact of gerrymandering [through] well-known examples” and that “this is a must-watch for anyone concerned about the state of politics today”.<br/></p><p>You can support your favorite theater by renting the film <a href=\"https://www.slaythedragonfilm.com/tickets/\">here</a>.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/judy-punch/\">Judy &amp; Punch</a><br/></b>Directed by Mirrah Foulkes</i></p><p>Mia Wasikovska and Damon Herriman, two of the more interesting Australian actors working in film today, and each possessed of a fantastically cinematic face, star in this one-of-a-kind film as a couple operating a marionette show in a town about to bubble over with tension.

It begins with a woman, Maria (Chiara Mastroianni, daughter of Italian-French acting royalty Marcello Mastroanni and Catherine Deneuve) deciding to leave her husband, and taking up residence across the street where she can observe him.</p><p>As Allison M. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/allisoncm/film/on-a-magical-night/\">explains</a>, “like a modernized version of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, spirits living and dead come to haunt Maria to help her make a decision about whether or not she should return to her husband.

Through one long workday, we are witness to the manipulative practices that enable such a figure, without ever landing on a single incident that she can cite as tangible proof of his behavior, which helps detail the impossibility of her—and countless others’—situation.</p><p>While the film’s understated style has thrown some viewers off, that’s entirely the point <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rwalley/film/the-assistant-2019/\">according to Ryne Walley</a>, who says it “aims true with unwavering confidence.

Johanna’s attempts to break into the media boys’ club, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinemababel/film/how-to-build-a-girl/\">CinemaBabel</a> writes, “is sure to resonate with many young women [who] have found themselves with the attention from those they’ve craved, especially men, only to find themselves hollower and [more] alone than they ever were at their lowest point”. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/highlife/film/how-to-build-a-girl/\">Siobhan</a> agrees, writing that the film is “perfect for girls who spent their years dreaming about getting out of the suburbs for something bigger and better”.</p><p>As is the way with adaptations, some aspects of the novel get short shrift in the film (Johanna’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/brez/film/how-to-build-a-girl/\">home life</a>, the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rosiehampton/film/how-to-build-a-girl/\">collateral damage</a> she leaves in her wake).

I mean, she’s like my aunt or sister at this point but I still shake around her because I just love her so much.</p><p>Truly, the way she extends a hand out to young women and says “I’ve got you and I’ve been there and you can own your experience, whatever that experience may be, and that is beautiful” is so special. It was the biggest honor of my life, and the biggest challenge too. Because I’m not from Wolverhampton, England, and I’ve never, you know, walked out in a bikini made of trash bags before!</p><p>It’s really the most beautiful coming-of-age story. So much heart, so much humor, and really touching at moments in a way that I think is unexpected. And it’s really sort of three different movies in one: you have the beautiful family story, you have all the boys at the magazine workplace, and then you have John Kite [played by Alfie Allen], and it just sweeps you off your feet as an audience member.</p><p><b>You are making films that so many girls get to experience as part of their own coming of age. What films did you love, growing up?<br/></b><i>BF:</i> I grew up obsessed with <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1KR2\"><i>Funny Girl</i></a>. Fanny Brice is my idol! But there’s so many that I cherish. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/rac\"><i>Bridesmaids</i></a>, my senior year of high school, was, like, the best movie ever. It was the most memorable theater-going experience of my life. But what I love about <i>How to Build a Girl</i> is that I’ve done so many films about friendship, which I love and cherish and is so important to me, but I feel like it was really interesting to explore what happens when a girl <i>doesn’t</i> have friends at that time in her life. I feel like that’s also a very important story, because not everyone has those people. Not everyone’s lucky enough to find their Lady Bird or their Amy, and so it was very special for me—and also very scary, I’m out here alone!</p><p><b>If there’s to be a film trilogy, are you in?<br/></b><i>BF: </i>Of course! I mean, she’s my girl! I feel so protective of Johanna and I love her so much. </p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>It’s so powerful to see the sex-positivity in <i>How To Build a Girl</i>. It feels like we’re finally getting a run of films that show young, female sexuality in a positive light, rather than as a force of darkness.<br/></b><i>Caitlin Moran:</i><b> </b>Well that was the key thing! I just felt that every film that I’d watched that was about female sexuality was like, the women would be punished for it. Like, you either get bummed over some bins or you just regret it or it just becomes very sour. I just wanted to see a girl who’s in control of her sexuality, who’s curious, who wants to go out and have sex adventures. She’s a ‘lady sex pirate’, that’s her whole thing. She just wants to go out and have adventures and gather her memories. Beanie looks incredible in this. You’ve never seen a girl that looks like Beanie, wearing her clothes and owning her sexuality and owning her physicality. It’s joyful in every single way. It makes my heart sing.</p><p><b>The soundtrack is soaked in 90s bangers. Did the songs make it to the soundtrack because you insisted they be in there? Did you personally ask the artists for their permission?<br/></b><i>CM: </i>Oh, absolutely. We wrote the whole script with all the music cues in it and 90 percent of those are in [the film]. It’s set in 1993 in London, so it’s an incredibly exciting time for rock’n’roll. We’ve got Elastica in there, we’ve got Happy Mondays, Primal Scream, Manic Street Preachers—this big rush of music.</p><p>And then John Kite is a singer-songwriter, and a very talented one. And we were like, “Oh my god, we’re going to have to get songs for him to sing!” And so I rang my friend Guy Garvey from Elbow and said, “Could you write us a song?” And he wrote us a song called ‘Day-Making Girl’, which, on his first day on set, Alfie had to sing a capella to a thousand people and absolutely nailed it in one. So it turns out Lily Allen isn’t the only rock star in that family. He sings like an angel!</p><p><b>You’ve written newspaper columns, books of essays, novels, and now your first screenplay (with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/john-niven/\">John Niven</a>). Which screenwriters’ work have you loved through the years?<br/></b><i>CM: </i>Oh my gosh. Who do I really love? If you read the scripts of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/bruce-robinson/\">Bruce Robinson</a>, who did <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Qa4\"><i>Withnail and I</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Npg\"><i>How to get Ahead in Advertising</i></a>, those scripts read beautifully. If you actually read them as scripts, all the description is there, he describes the sky looking the color of burnt sugar, and that’s someone who’s really enjoying writing and you feel that vivacity come through on the page and in the character of Withnail, so I love Bruce Robinson’s scripts.</p><p>More recently, who do I love? <a href=\"https://boxd.it/210a\"><i>Juno</i></a> was my favorite film of the last ten years—just the way that that story was told just made me incredibly happy. I just love Diablo Cody so much. When you read her stuff you feel her heart, sometimes her groin! And her massively exploding soul! So that’s what I’m always looking for. I just want to see things on screen that look real, that someone went, “I’m going to have to write this or bust.” I hate films that look like someone went, “Oh, we’d better make a film that looks like a film.” I want people to have sat down and done a list of things where they’re like, “What would I like to see on screen that I’ve never seen before?”</p><p>And that’s what we tried to do with <i>How to Build a Girl</i>. When I was writing the book, it was just a list of things that I’d never heard anybody talk about with girls. At the time that was, like, masturbation, sexual experimentation, optimism, confidence, being working class and making your way up from scratch. Finding a rock star that isn’t a clichéd druggy rock star. He’s actually a good, working-class boy who becomes a great friend. I’ve never seen that. Usually if a rock star character turns up in a film or a book, they’re going to be a bad ’un. And in our John Kite, he’s just a good boy and a friend. So yeah, I just ticked everything off both with the book and the film: “Yeah, we’ve done all these things.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>What was the moment you knew you had to option Caitlin’s novel?<br/></b><i>Alison Owen: </i>When I read her first book [of essays], which was <i>How to Be a Woman</i>, for me it was like the freaking Bible or something. Caitlin’s writing is every argument I’ve ever had with anyone at dinner or at a party. I thought, ‘If I just carry this book around with me the whole time, every time I have a row with someone about feminism I can pull it out and I can just quote it to them and I’ll have the answers.’ She’s much more articulate and intelligent than me!</p><p>But of course <i>How to Be a Woman</i> was quite tricky as a conversion into a film or a television series as it’s more of a how-to manual than it is a story. So I was really excited about <i>How to Build a Girl</i> because there’s a real story there. It’s got a spine and a shape that you can make into a movie. So I was like, yes, that’s the one we’re going to do.</p><p>The moment I read <i>How to Build a Girl</i>, I wanted to option it, but that was already optioned. And then by the time her second one came out [<i>How To Be Famous</i>], the option on that first one had lapsed, and so I scooped in and optioned all of them.<br/></p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Did you always imagine the very Californian Beanie Feldstein as the one to play this teenager from Wolverhampton?<br/></b><i>AO:</i> Well that was crazy. Obviously, we assumed we would be on a kind of street search, because we knew we weren’t going to find a ‘name’ to play a sixteen-year-old girl from Wolverhampton. Shaheen Baig, our casting director, was doing workshops and street casting and open casting and casting calls and this was all going on and we kept finding really good people, but nobody that would hold a movie for 100 minutes.</p><p>And then, I am on the board of the Savannah Film Festival. I went to Savannah and there was an early screening of <i>Lady Bird</i>, and the second I came out of that cinema I called Coky and I was like, “I found Johanna!” And she was like “What do you mean? We’re trying to cast a sixteen-year-old from Wolverhampton! You’re trying to cast a 25-year-old girl from California? What are you talking about?!” I said, “Just wait till you see it. She’s Johanna.”</p><p>We got Beanie to Skype with Coky, and Coky was bowled away straight away. She really just has all the qualities of Johanna. That kind of boundless joy and optimism and wonder that you need from that character. She’s got to be quite horrible, so you need someone who is innately likeable so that you don’t go off her at that point. You’ve got to keep hold of that washing line all through that movie.</p><p><b><i>How to Build a Girl </i>is all about a young woman discovering who she is, both professionally and personally. With your abundant screen credits, what advice do you have for young women wanting to step up into producing?<br/></b><i>AO: </i>I think just believe in yourself and be tenacious. You know, it’s such a young industry. That’s what I always say when I speak to students or young people and they’re like, “How do I ever get to do what you do?” I’m like, “You’re much better placed to do it than I am! I’m 58! Nobody wants me anymore!” You guys, you know what you’re watching and what all your friends are watching and the things that are going to turn you on. Believe in those, because that’s what’s going to sell. It’s a market.</p>"

I’m in my living room in the Lower East Side of New York, where I am every day, and I’m doing okay because I&rsquo;m throwing myself into this film release. It’s been a real relief to have something to do instead of just reading the news and being trapped at home. The timing is uncanny, but I’m seizing the moment. I’m very happy to be participating and doing lots of virtual events and promoting the film so that people will watch it, because I hope that it will give some perspective for what we’re going through.</p><p><b>That’s the next obvious question: how did your work on <i>Spaceship Earth</i> prepare you for this extraordinary moment, and what advice do you have for those of us sheltering in our own tiny biospheres?<br/></b>It’s funny. My producer Stacey Reiss says the Biospherians were in their world for two years; we were in our filmmaking bubble for two years, too. And so, we could relate in that way but we never thought we would relate so vividly to that experience. And I think, you know, talking to the Biospherians, something that they relayed was that it really was a transformative experience, because they were responsible for creating their own atmosphere, for producing the food they needed to eat, and they really couldn’t take anything for granted—even a breath of fresh air. So when they came out they felt a renewed connection to the larger world, and a different sense of responsibility and consequence for their actions.</p><p>I hope that in some ways we all feel transformed by this experience, and it allows us to engage with the world in a different way, because we’re going to have to think and act differently now that we really understand in a visual sense how fragile the world really is.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Yes, it feels like the Earth is breathing. It’s such an interesting time.<br/></b>Yeah. I think we need to make a connection between climate change and what’s happening now. If we don’t change how we behave, the threat of long-term catastrophe is inevitable. Not to take this to a dark place, but it’s true.</p><p><b>From a filmmaking perspective, we’re living in a time where, with social media and smartphones, we are creating our own content every second of every day. One thing that’s endlessly fascinating about archive-based films like yours, is how lucky we are to have had people—who were not necessarily filmmakers themselves—</b><b>document these extraordinary experiences. What was it like when you first started diving into that footage?<br/></b>I’m actually always on the lookout for stories that have a strong basis in archival material that can help activate them and bring them into the present. I was certainly determined to tell this story; it was extraordinary and I knew there was a great deal of media coverage. But when I went to meet the Synergists at their ranch, I was brought into this temperature-controlled room that had hundreds of 16mm film canisters, analog video cassettes, thousands of images; it was astonishing that they had had the foresight to not only document what they were doing but also to preserve it in such a meticulous way.</p><p>To me it was an indication that they recognized that what they were doing was history, but also kind of poignant because nobody had taken an interest in that archive and tapped into it, so it felt like an incredible opportunity, but also a responsibility as well. It would have been a much less potent film had we not had that material as well as the video diaries that Biospherian Roy Walford shot inside.</p><p>For me, it is unprecedented to be able to tell a story—particularly a story with so many narrative twists and turns—that has archival footage that covers literally every beat of the story. I don’t expect that to happen often in my filmmaking career! This was an extraordinary situation.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Okay Matt, you’re heading into the Biosphere, with no internet, and you can only take ten films with you. What are the films that you’d pack to take? To help you choose, we’ll give you some guidelines. What’s the movie you’ve watched the most?<br/></b>I would say the movie I’ve watched the most, ever, is Todd Haynes’ movie <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/superstar-the-karen-carpenter-story/\"><i>Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story</i></a>. It was a movie made with Barbie dolls about Karen Carpenter’s life. I have just watched that movie over and over and over again, and it’s a bootleg movie because the Carpenter estate suppressed it. It’s one of those things made of lore, in which people exchanged low-quality file transfers, and I got my hands on a high-quality restoration recently. I love showing it to people who haven’t seen it, and it’s a total joy to watch that movie. That is the movie that I would definitely need to have access to if I could never see anything again.</p><p><b>Can you name a favorite documentary; one that has meaning for you?<br/></b>Every once in a while I watch this documentary that really is in some ways my favorite. To me it’s like taking a bath to watch this film, a bath for my brain. It’s called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-skin-too-few-the-days-of-nick-drake/\"><i>A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake</i></a>. I’ve only been able to find it on YouTube; it’s not in distribution. I’m a fan, but the film is just made in such a delicate and visually precise way. It represents the type of filmmaking that I really love. It’s seemingly straightforward as a documentary, but I think in its subtlety it is really just a soothing and absorbing film.</p><p><b>What’s the film you’d take to entertain your fellow Biospherians on a Friday night?<br/></b>One of my favorites from when i was a kid that I think would be fun to watch on a Friday night is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/troop-beverly-hills/\"><i>Troop Beverly Hills</i></a>. If you want just like cotton candy, that would be my version of that.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>A film for the inevitable long, lonely, insomniac nights?<br/></b>If I was feeling depressed and lonely, and like really leaning into those feelings of isolation, maybe like Fassbinder’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ali-fear-eats-the-soul/\"><i>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</i></a>. I remember that as being a film that was at once devastating but also comforting. Just about human connection and human alienation. I just think it’s so deep and true.</p><p><b>What about a film that you like to impress people with because of the way it looks, or makes you feel?<br/></b>One of my favorite movies that I just love to show to people because it’s so amazing—well, there’s two that fit into that category, movies that are fun to show people because they are unbelievable and true. One is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hail-the-new-puritan/\"><i>Hail the New Puritan</i></a> by the artist Charlie Atlas. It’s a documentary about Michael Clark, a kind of punk ballet dancer from London in the 80s, who collaborated with Leigh Bowery and The Fall. Charlie, the filmmaker, made it in the model of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/29LS\">A Hard Day’s Night</a></i>, the Beatles vehicle, and it follows this gay punk ballet dancer on his nightlife and pseudo-celebrity adventures through 80s punk London.</p><p>And then my other film that is too good to be true is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-bigger-splash/\"><i>A Bigger Splash</i></a> [the 1973 Jack Hazen documentary, not the 2015 Luca Guadagnino feature], which is a similarly constructed documentary about David Hockney that feels like a fiction film staged with all the characters from his orbit during the height of his popularity in swinging London. It’s such a great depiction of an artist’s life and it’s completely baffling how the filmmaker was able to generate such access and to construct a film that feels so dramatized.</p><p><b>What film has had the biggest impact on you, whether for its meaning or for its execution?<br/></b>One of the films that had a big effect on me and that I really think the communal experience is central to, is Derek Jarman’s film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blue-1993/\">Blue</a>.</i> He made it when he was dying of AIDS and it’s a lush soundscape with a kind of like non-linear stream of thoughts coming from Derek Jarman, and a beautiful soundscape, with material from Brian Eno. It’s a feature-length film where the screen is just blue. Every time that film screens in the cinema, I take the opportunity to go because it’s almost a religious experience. A cinematic religious experience. I feel really moved by it but it also is something to share with other people, in an unusual way.</p><p><b>And a film that’s stuck with you since you were young?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/an-american-family/\"><i>American Family</i></a>—the documentary series that gave birth to reality TV. In the 1970s Alan and Susan Raymond made this epic PBS cinema-vérité series that followed this upper-middle-class San Diego, Californian family. In one episode, their son <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lance-loud-a-death-in-an-american-family/\">Lance Loud</a> moves to New York and is living at the Chelsea Hotel and his mum comes to visit and he comes out of the closet. It is a unique, different world, many of the Andy Warhol superstars are there. It [felt like] the first time a gay person had appeared on television and the drama unfolds over many episodes.</p><p>It was this huge controversy, people thought they were disgusting and perverse for putting their lives on television like this, but it also is kind of mundane and boring, just like a lot of the early cinema vérité, but it really laid the groundwork for what would become reality television, except it’s not constructed for the camera in the way that we expect these shows to be. I like watching serialized family stories like that, and this is the foundation of it.</p><p><b>What’s a recent queer film you’d take in with you?<br/></b>There’s this movie I was obsessed with. I just thought of it the other day: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/saint-laurent/\"><i>Saint Laurent</i></a>, by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/bertrand-bonello-1/\">Bertrand Bonello</a>. It came out a few years ago and it’s a completely narcotic, kaleidoscopic biopic, and I think it’s so rare that biopics actually inhabit the psyches of their famous protagonist and that the actors don’t just feel like they’re doing pantomime. This film really captures not only the disintegrating psychology of Yves Saint Laurent, but also the context of the gay subcultures of Paris in 1970s and the 80s. It’s this super-vivid depiction of subculture, but through a very narcotic lens. I just was obsessed with that film. It’s not really considered ‘queer film’, I think it’s more considered a biopic, but to me it’s one of the more interesting depictions of queer culture in recent years.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>And finally, a fond, family-viewing memory?<br/></b>I always loved <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory/\"><i>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</i></a>. I mean, I wouldn’t say it’s one of my favorite films but every time I see it, it’s like, “Oh, I get why I was obsessed with that as a kid”. I love the visual world and Gene Wilder is so bizarre and a little creepy. If you look at it as an adult there’s something kind of perverse about it, but I love a kind of analog fantasy world! So that film is, you might say, delicious.</p><p><b>You could say <i>Spaceship Earth</i> is a kind of analog fantasy world—the Biosphere itself is a living fantasy. I’m interested to know what you’d say to younger film lovers of today about what they might get out of seeing these avant-garde theater-makers-turned-Biospherians of yesterday?<br/></b>This film <i>is</i> more targeted towards younger people. I feel like there is a certain cynicism amongst adults that completely discounts young people and their ability to reimagine the world in creative ways. This is something I really dealt with in my film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/teenage/\"><i>Teenage</i></a>, the history of the invention of teenagers: adults always try to control young people. They corral the inventiveness of young people and the languages that they speak and invent. Young people all fight back, trying to define the world on their own terms, and this is really a film about a group of people who came together in their 20s and decided to reimagine and redefine, literally, a new world. There are all sorts of forces of establishment that tried to stop them and question and discount them.</p><p>We live in a world that’s pretty cynical and brings a lot of skepticism to people who try to do things differently, and I think as a 20-year-old you might see yourself in the idealism of these unusual people. Don’t you think that’s true? That, like, 20-year-olds aren’t as snarky and cynical? I feel like 20-year-olds are earnest and sincere and idealistic. Maybe I’m out of touch, but that was my experience and part of what I’ve observed in other young people.</p><p>I just feel like that ‘snarkiness’ that is often represented in the media is the cynicism that comes with the bitterness of life experience. And when you’re young and don’t have hardships and disappointments that have maybe hardened you with a certain kind of cynicism, it is possible to think more expansively and more optimistically about the world. We really need to tap into that energy. It’s not really helpful at this moment to, I don’t know, to shoot down anyone who’s trying something new. I hadn’t thought about that, but I&rsquo;d be really curious what young people think of the film.</p><p><b>That’s a useful perspective, and makes me think of how, over the last couple of years, we have seen so much grassroots activism from young people, and now with the global lockdown there’s been a quieting of the youth climate movement, at least out there on the streets.<br/></b>You’re totally right. It was this big loud wave of activity and now with the pandemic it has really been washed over. But what they&rsquo;re talking about is long-term consequences, and if we don’t address the underlying issues that have related to the collapse of our society as a result of uncontrollable environmental factors, the survival of our species is threatened.</p>"

What spoke to you about these four films?<br/></b>The pragmatic reason for these four is that they were the last films I watched that got full marks from me. So the four favorites on my profile keep changing as I come across more films that I think deserve five stars. About the current ones: <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jaws/\">Jaws</a>,</i> of course, is an absolute classic, maybe even Spielberg’s greatest. How he creates that much tension with minimal exposition is masterful. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner-2049/\"><i>Blade Runner 2049</i></a> baffled me, especially on an aesthetic level. I love how the story slowly unravels in probably one of the best world-building efforts of the last couple of years. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring/\"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i></a> doesn’t need much explanation, I think. Peter Jackson did what was generally thought impossible and in a way that had me walking out of the cinema in awe of the spectacle and production design. Last but not least, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind/\"><i>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</i></a>. I’m a huge fan of the Studio Ghibli films and this one, [as well as] being the studio’s unofficial first, is probably my favorite. You can just tell that they worked years to get Hayao Miyazaki’s life’s work to the big screen.</p><p><b>Let’s get down to brass tacks: for the past six and a half years, you’ve been running the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/list/official-top-250-narrative-feature-films/\">Official Letterboxd Top 250</a>, one of our most popular and important lists. What prompted you to start the list? Did you think you’d be keeping it going this long?<br/></b>At least part of the credit goes to someone else on Letterboxd, because even my list is a cloned one! A great deal of thanks goes to a member called The Caker Baker, who sadly isn’t part of the community anymore, for having the idea of doing this list even before me. On the exact day Letterboxd introduced a sorting option by average rating on the Films page, he created the first top 250 list.</p><p>I decided to clone that list [Dave has archived it <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5ob3E\">here</a>], because I wanted to filter out the documentaries, shorts and miniseries. As long as I am interested in film and won’t have completed the list, I do see myself keeping it. I feel the overall quality of the list is outstanding and for my taste and film-watching experience it’s probably the best combination of blockbuster hits, timeless Hollywood classics, non-English spoken gems, and some pretty obscure entries.</p><p><b>What’s involved in keeping the top 250 up-to-date? What’s the hardest thing about it? Have you ever found the responsibility a burden—your ankle chained to Letterboxd each week? (We’re grateful!)<br/></b>These days it isn’t much of a bother at all, actually. I’m still so grateful for you guys introducing the ability to sort lists by average rating when editing them a while back. That was a huge relief, I can tell you! And apart from the odd comment when I’m a bit late on my weekly update or when I’m on a well-deserved holiday (yes, even the ankle chain comes off once in a while), I don’t feel like it’s a burden at all.</p><p><b>Let’s unpack it a bit. What are the best films you’ve discovered because of the list? Shoutout to my choices: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-special-day/\"><i>A Special Day</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/harakiri/\"><i>Harakiri</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-man-who-sleeps/\"><i>The Man Who Sleeps</i></a>.</b><br/><i>Harakiri</i> is an excellent choice! If it wasn’t for Letterboxd’s top list, I would probably not even know about it today, although it also cracked IMDb’s top 250 last year. What a beautiful film. If I have to name two other, one would be <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cranes-are-flying/\"><i>The Cranes Are Flying</i></a>. I’ve rarely seen a film about war being depicted so beautifully. The other is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/its-such-a-beautiful-day/\"><i>It’s Such a Beautiful Day</i></a>, the animation by Don Hertzfeldt about a stick figure you get to care deeply about in a time span of just over an hour. Very different films that, without Letterboxd, the chances are next to zero that I would have checked either of them out. Joining a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1072409840/hertzfeldt-on-blu-ray\">Kickstarter</a> to finance my own Blu-ray edition of the latter was special too.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>So, what’s your percentage-seen of the top 250? Which films rank highest on your list of shame? Are there any that you don’t think you’ll ever watch?<br/></b>At this moment I’m at 175 of 250, so 70 percent. I rarely consider films as being on a ‘list of shame’, but as I scroll through the unseen ones, there are a few that stand out. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/la-dolce-vita/\"><i>La Dolce Vita</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/satantango/\"><i>Sátántangó</i></a> [Editor’s note: recently re-released in 4K, nudge nudge] are ones that I feel I should have watched by now. Both are magnum opuses from legendary foreign filmmakers. Don’t really know why I haven’t though, but all in good time. Any that I think I’ll never watch? There’s not much I wouldn’t watch, but some are just so daunting in their runtime, that I’m not sure if I will ever feel up to the task (yes, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/la-flor/\"><i>La Flor</i></a>, I’m looking at you). Probably also the reason I never popped <i>Sátántangó</i> in.</p><p><b>Has the way Letterboxd’s membership has changed and grown affected what’s in the top 250 in any interesting or unexpected ways?<br/></b>That’s not a very easy question to answer, because different people will be surprised about different things. However, you do see a trend—surprising or not—of traditional western cinema classics giving way to more non-English language films doing well on the list. Asian and Brazilian films have skyrocketed to great heights, often at the expense of western classics. Films that are traditionally doing great at IMDb, such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pulp-fiction/\"><i>Pulp Fiction</i></a> or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/\"><i>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</i></a>, were in Letterboxd’s top ten for a long time, but have both dropped out of the top twenty. Beloved classics among film critics such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/citizen-kane/\"><i>Citizen Kane</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sunrise-a-song-of-two-humans/\"><i>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/casablanca/\"><i>Casablanca</i></a> aren’t even in the top 100 anymore.</p><p>We now have a top ten with three Japanese films, one Taiwanese, one Russian, one Brazilian and a South Korean film at the very top. The only English spoken films left there are the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/the-godfather-collection/by/rating/size/large/\">two <i>Godfathers</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/12-angry-men/\"><i>12 Angry Men</i></a>. I do tend to suspect that the growing community causes more diversity while also fuelling the more traditional moviegoers to broaden their interests. I personally think that’s a great development.</p><p><b>How did you feel when <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/\"><i>Parasite</i></a> overtook <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-godfather/\"><i>The Godfather</i></a> to become <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/189121662338/bong-hit-parasite\">Letterboxd’s highest-rated film of all time</a>? Do you think it’ll ever sink at this point?<br/></b>To say I was surprised is quite the understatement. For something to even come close to <i>The Godfather</i>’s record borders on sacrilege, let alone dethroning it. What you usually see is that new movies with overly positive reviews enter the list’s higher ranks with a bang, but when they are introduced to a bigger crowd, they slowly descend. For example, fellow acclaimed Best Picture nominees <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/12-years-a-slave/\"><i>12 Years A Slave</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/her/\"><i>Her</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/call-me-by-your-name/\"><i>Call Me By Your Name</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/roma-2018/\"><i>Roma</i></a> all peaked in the top twenty and only <i>Call Me By Your Name</i> is still in the list, at number 232 for now.</p><p>In these days of ready availability it is extremely hard to create something that has such a large following. That’s why this takeover by <i>Parasite</i> is so extraordinary. Seeing it rise day-by-day—even after the masses took it in—was something I didn’t think possible. I, for one, am very slow to watch new films, so when I got to watch it, it was already in first position. Safe to say my expectation level was through the roof, which probably wasn’t really fair. While I thought it was an excellent film, I personally wouldn’t rank it among my favorites. However, it’s not only the highest-ranked film on Letterboxd, but also the most popular one [a measure of the amount of activity for a film, regardless of rating]! So don’t expect to see it sink lower any time soon.</p><p><b>The top 250 is home to the largest comment section on the platform. Congrats! What’s monitoring that mammoth thread like?<br/></b>Thank you! Although that’s hardly an achievement on my part. I have to be honest, I don’t read everything in the comments section anymore. I try to keep up as much as possible, in order to respond to people who have an actual question. However, when I sign in in the morning and see dozens of new notifications, most probably about <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-dogs-will/\">A Dog’s Will</a></i> being in the top ten or about recency bias or about objective quality versus subjective quality, I let it pass me by every so often.</p><p><b>What <i>is</i> your take on <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-dogs-will/\">A Dog’s Will</a></i>’s rise to Letterboxd stardom? (At the time of writing, the 2000 Brazilian film from director Guel Arraes holds the number eight spot in the top 250.)<br/></b>Ah, there it is: the elephant in the room… My honest answer is a politically correct one, but also the truth: I haven’t seen it yet, so it’s impossible to pass judgment. However, from the comments section on the top 250, it seems clear that there are two camps: the Brazilians, who adore the film and continually claim the importance it in their cultural heritage. And there’s the other group, mostly non-Brazilians of course, who think it’s a fine film at best, but in their opinion not deserving of a top-ten spot. I’m quite impartial: if the statistics say that it is one of the best-rated films of the Letterboxd community, why would it not deserve to be there? I am curious though if more non-Brazilians will see it and if so, if that will have a significant effect on its rating. We can only wait and see.</p><p><b>Are there any films you’re surprised to have stayed in the list for so long? Conversely, what are some films that we’ll be surprised to hear have never made the list?<br/></b>If I have to name one film that I’m surprised about, it’s one I haven’t seen yet: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/paddington-2/\"><i>Paddington 2</i></a>. Every time I scroll past it, I find myself asking: “wow, this one still in?” It’s probably because I haven’t seen it, but it always strikes me as an odd one. I really have to seek it out some time. Some films that might shock people never having made it… Well, if you look at IMDb’s list for reference, you could say it’s shocking that a film like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/forrest-gump/\"><i>Forrest Gump</i></a> never made it onto the list, but that might not be as much of a shock to Letterboxd members. Other popular crowd pleasers that never made it include <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/et-the-extra-terrestrial/\"><i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gladiator-2000/\"><i>Gladiator</i></a>, all of Disney’s non-Pixar animated classics, and one of the films that also sparked my interest in movies, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-usual-suspects/\"><i>The Usual Suspects</i></a>.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>I’ve actually been working hard on completing the list during quarantine and I finished it yesterday. Has anyone else gotten to 100 percent yet or am I the first?<br/></b>I have no idea, to be honest! There will probably be others who have, but I wouldn’t be able to name one. I suspect <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jakk/\">Jakk</a> might have reached 100 percent at some point.</p><p><b>My completist streak will need a new avenue. What are your next most essential top lists?<br/></b>If you ever feel up for a challenge, I recommend Top10er’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/top10ner/list/2020-edition-top10ners-1001-greatest-movies/\">1001 Greatest Movies of All Time</a>. He combined the average ratings of critics and users from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and Letterboxd, and then weighted and tweaked the results with general film data from several services. I have no idea how, but it’s a terrific list. Also, the directors’ favorites lists that are on Letterboxd are awesome. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/edgar-wrights-1000-favorite-movies/\">Edgar Wright’s 1,000 favorites</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ben_macdonald/list/guillermo-del-toros-twitter-film-recommendations/\">Guillermo del Toro’s recommendations</a> are especially worth your while.</p><p><b>The top 250 list is the tip of the iceberg for the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/lists/\">lists on your account</a>. What is it you enjoy about keeping ranked lists?<br/></b>It’s a compulsion. I just really enjoy making lists, ranking films by certain directors, franchises or studios. Not really useful, mostly just fun to do! And I’m not the only one, it seems. Although, of course, lists like the Letterboxd Top 250 will always be an inspiration for finding well-rated films I haven’t seen yet.</p><p><b>Which films got you hooked on cinema?<br/></b>I do have a few titles that were important in terms of my film-watching development. Films like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/terminator-2-judgment-day/\">Terminator 2<i>: Judgment Day</i></a></i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jurassic-park/\"><i>Jurassic Park</i></a> came out when I was an early teenager and those were the ones luring me to the cinema to see and experience things you just couldn’t in the real world, both with groundbreaking special effects—I’m a sucker for those. Not much later, titles like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shawshank-redemption/\"><i>The Shawshank Redemption</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pulp-fiction/\"><i>Pulp Fiction</i></a> were popular and that’s probably around the time that IMDb’s list got my attention. That top 250 gets a lot of criticism, but the overall quality is fine and for me it was the perfect step in broadening my film-watching.</p><p>So, for a long time I watched a lot of films on that list and went to the cinema for your usual blockbusters, probably until Letterboxd arrived. That’s when I started watching the artsier stuff and foreign cinema of which, of course, all classics eluded me up till then. It was films like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/seven-samurai/\"><i>Seven Samurai</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/persona/\"><i>Persona</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/werckmeister-harmonies/\"><i>Werckmeister Harmonies</i></a> that sparked that particular period. Now I just watch everything that comes my way that seems interesting or entertaining, from the new Marvel instalment to classic Godard.</p><p><b>Tell us about <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/films/ratings/rated/%C2%BD/by/date/\">the one and only movie</a> you’ve given a half-star.<br/></b>Ha, that’s an odd one… Once there was a challenge on the site that you could ask a fellow member to pick the next ten films for them to watch. I participated once and, of course, there would be underseen gems or personal favorites on that list, but also one or two that would be almost unwatchable. In my list that was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/film/santa-and-the-ice-cream-bunny/\"><i>Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny</i></a>. If that title alone doesn’t give away how bad it was, watching the first five minutes will.</p><p><b>In your opinion, what’s the most underrated film according to Letterboxd average ratings?<br/></b>One that comes to mind, which was in the top 250 once, but has dropped substantially in the last few years, is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gravity-2013/\"><i>Gravity</i></a>. I also have a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/list/letterboxd-top-250-films-history-collected/\">list</a> where I collect all the films that were once in Letterboxd’s top 250 and it’s at the very bottom there. For me, seeing that film in a theater is what cinema is all about—finding new ways to immerse your audience into a movie experience they have never had before. Oh, did I mention I’m a sucker for special effects?</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>As a Dutchman, please educate us: what are the greatest <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/country/netherlands/\">Dutch</a> films people should see?<br/></b>The Netherlands doesn’t really have a thriving movie industry that brings its films across borders. If I have to give the essential tip, it would be <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-vanishing/\"><i>Spoorloos</i></a>, which was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-vanishing-1993/\">remade</a> starring Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock and was not half as good. Other than that I would recommend Paul Verhoeven’s early work, such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/soldier-of-orange/\"><i>Soldaat van Oranje</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/turkish-delight/\"><i>Turks Fruit</i></a>, and the two Dutch films that won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, 1986’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-assault/\"><i>De Aanslag</i></a> and 1997’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/character/\"><i>Karakter</i></a>. And to top it off, I want to mention two Dutch filmmakers worth your time, Alex van Warmerdam, director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-northerners/\"><i>De Noorderlingen</i></a>, and Martin Koolhoven, director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/winter-in-wartime/\"><i>Oorlogswinter</i></a>.</p><p><b>What comfort movies are you watching whilst in quarantine? Are you working on any viewing projects?<br/></b>I actually am in a viewing project at the moment. One of mine and my wife’s guilty pleasures is superhero movies! So currently we are, again, on a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/list/ranked-marvel-cinematic-universe/\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> rewatch streak. They just provide a wonderful form of escapism and are definitely deserving of the term comfort movies. Some are better than others of course, but the perspective of rewatching <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-avengers-2012/\"><i>The Avengers</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thor-ragnarok/\"><i>Thor: Ragnarok</i></a> or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy/\"><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></a> after a while still tends to fill me with excitement. In a way, there’s still a bit of the twelve-year-old in me that was so thrilled to see <i>T2</i> or <i>Jurassic Park</i>.</p><p><b>How do you plan on inducting your kids into the cinephile life?<br/></b>Well, most important is that they just enjoy going to the movies like I did when I was young. Let’s hope we will be able to do so again in the near future. They are still young, but their access to screen time with Netflix, Disney+ and (mind-numbingly stupid clips on) YouTube is so different than the days when we were young. So having them watch some <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/list/ranked-studio-ghibli/\">Ghibli classics</a> is already quite a step. And then I think the rest should come naturally. If not, so be it.</p><p><b>Which, for you, are the most useful features on Letterboxd?<br/></b>Did you know they have a list with the 250 best rated narrative feature films? That’s basically all you need to know… All kidding aside, just reading reviews once in a while by fellow members whose opinions I value is still the heart of the service to me. That and the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/stats/\">statistics</a> pages. And browsing other lists.</p><p><b>Does anyone in your real life know that your list is kind of a Letterboxd big deal?<br/></b>Not really! Mostly because I don’t exactly feel that way about it. I mean: my wife knows, but other than that it’s pretty much still my pet project. To me, it’s still just a film enthusiast’s list that so happened to become the site’s official top 250. I do have to say that it is humbling to see the numbers of new followers every day—especially when Letterboxd mentions the list on her social accounts—and to realize that apparently almost 23,000 people around the globe have taken a liking to it.</p><p><b>Please name three other members you recommend we follow.<br/></b>Fellow countryman and longtime member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dirkh/\">DirkH</a>. He is not as active as he was before, but writes beautifully personal reviews, always with his trademark witty humor or sometimes cheeky sarcasm, not always to the liking of everyone.

Nevertheless, seeing the film in a cinema in ‘the before time’ highlighted for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rhefs/film/the-assistant-2019/\">Alyssa Heflin</a> the ocean of different opinions that can come from misunderstood subtext: “Watching this in a room where you can hear people snickering at the girl and asking what the point of all this is adds a certain extra… incendiary level to an already deeply angry viewing experience.” Indeed, discomfort and crossed wires seem to define the messages at the core of <i>The Assistant</i>.</p><p>Kitty Green talks to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/\">Ella Kemp</a> about the influence of Chantal Akerman, the infinite watchability of Julia Garner, and the oddness of growing up with a Nazi-free edit of <i>The Sound of Music</i>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b><i>The Assistant</i> is your first fiction feature. The subject matter feels so immediate—what made you choose to not make a documentary of this, given your track record in that realm?</b><br/><i>Kitty Green:</i> I went to fiction film school, and I made fiction short films. I then found work in documentary, so I made two feature-length docs. With this one, I was looking at exploring the micro-aggressions, the tiny moments, gestures, looks, glances, behaviors that often go overlooked when covering the #MeToo movement. We often talk about the bad men and the misconduct, but this is more about a cultural, structural problem. So I was hoping to amplify the more quietly insidious behavior that we need to address if we really want things to improve. A fiction film allowed me to hone in on details—close up—and the way you can take an annoyance through the emotional experience, putting the audience in the shoes of the youngest woman in a toxic work environment.</p><p><b>How did you decide to keep the timeframe to just one day in Jane’s life rather than fleshing it out over a longer period?</b><br/>The lead character is in such a complicated position. It’s such a difficult set of circumstances, the machinery that this predator has created around himself. I wanted to untick that, to discuss how difficult it is to be a young woman in that environment. So the day, the routine, was really important. What she was experiencing, how she was experiencing it; every task she did I gave equal weight to. Whether she was photocopying, binding something suspicious, you experience it as you would if you were in her shoes. That was important to me.</p><p><b>I had my fists clenched the whole time, when she’d be eating cereal, or washing up mugs, waiting for something awful to happen.</b><br/>Totally. It’s exploring misconduct, but it’s also looking at a whole spectrum, from gendered work environments, toxic work environments, through all these environments that support predatory behavior. I was interested in what the entry points are, without conflating those issues and being able to explore all the cultural systemic things we need to unpick to move forward.</p><p><b>The film is so focused on Jane, played by Julia Garner. How did you choose her?</b><br/>The script is pretty bare when it describes who she is, she’s just Jane. I didn’t have anyone in mind, really. I told my casting agent that we’re watching this character do the most mundane tasks, so it was important that she was striking. I said I needed someone infinitely watchable. I had seen Julia in <i>The Americans</i> and I remembered being struck by her, so I immediately wanted to meet her. She really understood the script, it worked out beautifully. We got to create the character together, we had a month of rehearsals where we really went through where she was emotionally at any given point, and Julia is wonderful so it was great.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>And <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/matthew-macfadyen/\">Matthew Macfadyen</a>—his character feels so crucial and his performance so pivotal, even in just one scene. What were you looking for when casting him?</b><br/>I’ve been a fan of his for forever, but I hadn’t seen <i>Succession</i>. Apparently the character has some similarities? I’ve only watched <i>Succession</i> in the past week… Somebody had to send me a clip to prove he could do an American accent! Matthew really brought something to that character and took it to another level. It’s so insidious what he does. He and Julia worked so beautifully together, it just got better and better every time.</p><p><b>How did you feel watching <i>Succession</i> now and seeing Matthew as Tom Wambsgans?</b><br/>Tom still feels different somehow. But I’ve had a good time watching it, he’s so great. There are parallels for sure!</p><p><b>The language you use in the film is so careful, so much is in the subtext. How do you build tension from these empty spaces?</b><br/>We had a great visual team who were lighting it in an interesting way. There was a lot of oppressive fluorescent lights. The sound was also very important—we had an amazing sound designer, Leslie Schatz, who does a lot of Todd Haynes’ stuff and Gus Van Sant’s. He’d done <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/elephant-2003/\">Elephant</a></i>, which I thought was phenomenally sound designed. He sent out a team to record every kind of buzz, hum, whir, and we created a lot of tension in that soundscape. It heightens these moments when you can really feel the hum of the fluorescent lights or the alarm of the copier. Things like that are authentic to the world, so it doesn’t feel like you’re manipulating an audience, but they do add a dramatic tension.</p><p><b>During <i>The Assistant</i>’s various film festival screenings so far, audience reactions have been quite varied. Some people find it uncomfortable, some have found it funny. What would you hope an audience member would take from it?</b><br/>Who found it funny…? That’s a strange reaction, and a little terrifying. I think it makes some men uncomfortable and maybe their reaction is to laugh as a way to hide that discomfort. I get a lot of men come up to me afterwards and say, “There are things in that film that maybe I have done.” Those conversations are really important. There’s a scene where the men lean over Jane’s chair and correct her email, little things like that which can be quite patronising even if a lot of men think are helpful. But there’s a point where they cross a line, where maybe it isn’t helpful anymore and it’s a little insulting. I’ve had a few people who are bosses with their own assistants who have watched the film and have said they’re going to treat them a little better, and that maybe they’re wrestling with their own guilt. I think those conversations are great.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What is your favorite one-woman-show performance, where one female actor entirely carries the film?</b><br/>A big influence on <i>The Assistant</i> was Chantal Akerman’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles/\">Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</a></i>. It’s just one woman going about her housework. I remember seeing that in film school and being bowled over by it, I’d never seen anything like it.</p><p><b>Do you have a favorite scene that has ever taken place in an office environment?</b><br/>Offices… I mean, I love <i>The Office</i>? I watched it in preparation for this, even though there’s seemingly nothing in common except for the ways of the photocopier…</p><p><b>It’s important to inhale that kind of comedy while working on something more intense, right?</b><br/>For sure, that helps.</p><p><b>What is your favorite on-screen argument?</b><br/>I watched a lot of them to prepare for the HR scene, as it’s a confrontation between two characters. There’s a scene in Steve McQueen’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hunger/\">Hunger</a></i>, which is a seventeen-minute dialogue. It’s an incredible scene. It’s not an argument but still some sort of confrontation. I was interested in scenes like that which are really long and stand out from the rest of the movie. James Schamus, one of my producers, made a film called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/indignation-2016/\">Indignation</a>,</i> which has a confrontation between two characters, which also influenced the structure of what I was doing. I also just watched the latest episode of <i>Better Call Saul</i> in which there’s a sixteen-minute confrontation, which I thought was pretty remarkable.</p><p><b>What was the first film that made you want to be a filmmaker?</b><br/>To be honest I’m not sure. I got a video camera when I was eleven, and I started playing with it in our backyard, making little movies. It wasn’t that I saw a film and tried to replicate it necessarily. But I do have a strange story…</p><p>I had a copy of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-sound-of-music/\">The Sound of Music</a></i> in which my father had edited out the Nazis, because he was worried I’d be scared of them as a kid. So I have this strange 40-minute version of the film that ends at the wedding scene… And I always thought that was <i>The Sound of Music</i>, and then in high school I figured out there’s this whole other storyline I never knew existed. I guess that taught me the power of editing! I had to go back and rewatch what I’d seen, and it definitely made me think of the craft more as a viewer.</p>"

If you wish, you can change the default in your <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/settings/\">profile settings</a> screen to one of two new options: <b>Friends</b> (only people you follow may post replies) and <b>You</b> (this effectively closes comments to everyone but you, as you’re free to post to your own threads any time).</p><p>The account default only affects other members’ ability to post <i>new</i> replies to your reviews and lists (including replies to existing content and any new content you add). Changing the default <i>does not</i> hide or remove comments that have already been posted (but see below for other useful options).</p><h2>Overriding the default</h2><!--figure[2]--><p>From time to time you may wish to change who can reply to a particular list or review to something other than your account default setting, so we’ve also added a per-thread option to override your default choice. For example, if you write a personal essay and don’t wish to have anyone comment on it, you can select the <b>You</b> option for just that review—meaning no-one else will be able to reply—while leaving the rest of your content open for replies.</p><p>The new reply setting for each review or list is displayed below the comment thread (if you are the content owner) and includes four options: the same three options as for your account (<b>Anyone</b>, <b>Friends</b> and <b>You</b>) and an option to use your account’s default setting. All new reviews and lists use this fourth option, unless you change them.</p><p>Once again, changing the reply setting for a single thread controls who can post <i>new</i> comments and does not affect any comments that have already been posted.</p><h2>Deleting comments</h2><p>When it comes to removing unwanted comments from your reviews and lists <i>after</i> they have been posted, you have previously had two courses of action: report the comment to a moderator or block the comment’s author, thereby removing <i>all</i> their comments posted to any of your content.</p><p>Now, to give you further control of your own space on Letterboxd, we are adding the option for members to delete individual comments that have been posted to <i>their own</i> reviews and lists by others, no matter when those comments were posted (you can already delete your own comments). We’re putting more power in your hands—to use as you deem necessary—and thus we are unlikely to respond to reports lodged by members whose replies get deleted. Be cool, be polite; don’t spam, antagonize or harass, and you’ll be fine.</p><p>The account default and per-thread reply settings, and the option to delete comments from your own content, are <b>available now</b> on the web and in the latest versions of our iOS and Android apps, rolling out for all members today.

The pale blues of Studio Ghibli, Wong Kar-wai’s passionate reds, the pastels of Netflix Original breezy romances. Like some kind of cinematic ikebana, countless Letterboxd members have mastered the art of arranging film posters. There are standouts: the staggering oeuvre that is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/fxckitdude/list/my-favorite-movie-posters/\">Gordon’s chromatic roundup of favorite posters</a>; the comprehensive color-graded history of women directors via their best posters, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/michaelhaneke/list/films-directed-by-women/\">courtesy of Vanessa</a>; and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/matthew/list/the-cream-the-bone-the-off-white-the-ivory/\">the penchant for beige in the year 2015</a>, as spotted by Letterboxd co-founder Matthew Buchanan.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>But when I see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sarahsen/list/movie-posters-with-white-backgrounds/\">these 300 examples</a>, color-coded by typography and accents by Sera Ash, I recognize that white movie posters are the ones most likely, in this very strange time, to take care of me. I see it in three distinct filmmaking periods: Disney animations from the 1940s and 50s, the video marketing for cult comedies of the 1980s and 90s, and the alternative marketing materials of my favorite films of the 2010s. Each poster is straightforward and inoffensive. It captures the story, but never dares to impress or intimidate beyond basic description.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>In 1937, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/\">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></i> announced the birth of Walt Disney’s feature-length empire. While its <a href=\"https://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2010/06/snow-white-movie-posters-one-sheets.html\">original theatrical poster</a> is also mostly white, it is represented on Letterboxd by a 1975 re-release poster depicting a peek through the keyhole: a curved triangle framing Snow White, the dwarves, and the two sides of the jealous queen, against a vivid green forest. In the bottom corner, a castle. To the left, the title—her name in red cursive, theirs in black. These simple images come together to present an elementary summary of the ingredients within. The white frame showcases the seminal animation craft without suggesting the viewer diverts their eye anywhere else.</p><p>This technique was common across other animated titles, collected in lists like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dantebk/list/disney-animated-classics/\">dantebk’s Disney animated classics</a>. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pinocchio/\"><i>Pinocchio</i></a> toys with the hyperreal relationships between characters alive and wooden, human and animal—but does so on a plain canvas, so that the magic remains within reach. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dumbo/\">Dumbo</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bambi/\">Bambi</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/cinderella/\">Cinderella</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/peter-pan/\">Peter Pan</a></i>—each follows suit. Whether with the mustard yellow of a circus tent, the faint sketches of grass tufts, the gold dust of an enchanted fairy godmother or the ink blue of a midnight starry sky, these colors (indicative of each defining scene-setter or mood-maker) only pepper a blank background, and so make their significance ever greater with the most sporadic touches.</p><!--figure[4]--><p>Live-action knockouts from these decades—films like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shop-around-the-corner/\"><i>The Shop Around The Corner</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-red-shoes/\"><i>The Red Shoes</i></a>—embrace painted recreations of their protagonists (Margaret Sullivan and James Stewart as festive lovers in the former, Moira Shearer as a tortured ballerina in the latter) and use the color red as a signifier of romance, against a plain white page, to set the mood. Slashes and splashes of red have been used to create a vibe in genre cinema for many decades—a trend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/springbreakers/list/black-and-white-movie-posters-with-accent/\">deftly chronicled in this list by Rocks</a>.</p><p>As far as we know, the underpinnings of digital photography began in the 1950s, and the first published color digital photograph dates back to 1972, when Michael Francis Tompsett shot a photo of his wife Margaret for the cover of <i>Electronics</i> magazine. Consumers got their hands on the gear in the late 1990s, but movie studios really started to make the most of sharp digital photography and stark white backgrounds for their striking posters from the late 1980s onwards. Because, never mind the multiplex, the video store is where you wanted your comfort fare to stand out in the 1980s and 90s.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ferris-buellers-day-off/\">Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</a></i> (1986) and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/say-anything/\"><i>Say Anything…</i></a> (1989) form a handsome, trend-setting 1980s pair. While the theatrical poster for Cameron Crowe’s <i>Say Anything…</i> deigned to include John Cusack’s co-star, Ione Skye, by the time of the film’s video release, the focus is clearly on pre-<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/high-fidelity/\"><i>High Fidelity</i></a> Cusack, as proud underachiever Lloyd Dobler, smouldering lopsidedly under the weight of a boombox. It’s the singular image of the film to this day.</p><p>Meanwhile, Matthew Broderick as Ferris-slacking-Bueller is making the most of his title activity, arms behind his head, a proud smirk on his face. Nothing else matters except that these charismatic young stars are stepping up to leading-man status. The white background accentuates the star power of these new boys in town, embracing the limelight in one fell swoop.</p><p>Star power is everything: beautiful people doing simple things against empty backdrops, because what could be more important than the regularity of symmetrical bone structure, of familiar charm? The trend boomed in the 1990s and 2000s, in films widely embraced by casual moviegoers. The sort who list “watching Netflix” as a Sunday activity on dating profiles and use the Christmas holidays to rewatch comedies they have memorized over dozens of half-attentive viewings (absolutely zero judgement here!).</p><p>The vast majority of these films have white posters. Who is your soothing cup of charm: Tom Hanks on a bench, nothing more nothing less, from 1994’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/forrest-gump/\"><i>Forrest Gump</i></a>? Or Heath Ledger, effortlessly cool, leaning on the brown corduroy armchair Julia Stiles sits in for the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/10-things-i-hate-about-you/\"><i>10 Things I Hate About You</i></a> poster from 1999? (The 90s harnessed the increased appeal of having two lookers just sitting and posing against a plain background, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sloanepeterson/list/the-classic-couple-poses-in-front-of-a-white/\">as demonstrated in this chilling list by Ashley</a>.)</p><!--figure[6]--><p>Will Ferrell had been earning his stripes as an actor for years, but he changed the movie comedy game as Buddy the Elf in 2003. There’s plenty of visual humour in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/elf/\"><i>Elf</i></a>, but Ferrell’s coat-stand posture bedecked in festive green velvet and those tights is… enough. A white background lets the ridicule slide, just.</p><p>How many Disney series really deserve a whole movie—and one that stands the test of time? Lizzie McGuire, resting on her tiptoes with a swinging suitcase in hand, sells <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lizzie-mcguire-movie/\"><i>The Lizzie McGuire Movie</i></a> like no idyllic views of Rome ever could. It’s reaching out to an audience loyal to the character, one who will follow her to the ends of the Earth, or at least to another continent. Hilary Duff could be doing almost anything on this poster and it would achieve the same effect—so long as the white background remains plain enough to keep eagle-eyed fans on the main event at all times.</p><p>It’s surprising that the star-making system only let Meryl Streep appear in a tiny box, one of four character tiles, on the poster for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-devil-wears-prada/\"><i>The Devil Wears Prada</i></a> in 2006. But the design here taps into 1940s animated sensibilities, giving prominence to a devilish red Macguffin larger than the humans. It still achieves the same function—a glossy, glamorous design with the accessible sell of a quotable, star-fuelled comedy.</p><!--figure[7]--><p>Red may be the color of romance and the devil; it’s also <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ewantough/list/comedy-films-with-posters-featuring-a-white/\">the color of comedy</a>. Exhibit A: the 2007 gross-out comedy <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/superbad/\"><i>Superbad</i></a>, whose star power—marking the emergence of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera—is used to an opposite and impressive effect on its poster. The awkwardness of these teen boys—lanky, unkempt, insecure—is what cinches the comedy. The simplicity of the poster design, with their uncomfortable posture against, well, nothing at all, further anchors their incapability of facing the world in any confident way, shape or form.</p><p>There are countless more examples, like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/marley-me/\">Marley &amp; Me</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bridesmaids/\">Bridesmaids</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/27-dresses/\">27 Dresses</a></i> (notice how the red type is replaced by pink when the film’s plot veers toward the altar). But to understand the curious and timeless appeal of the white movie poster, what happened to it in the 2010s cements its adaptable strength.</p><p>As the art of graphic design has continued to bloom, the aesthetic argument for the colorless color-block movie poster has shifted to embrace a film’s context. Consider Danny Boyle’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/steve-jobs/\">Steve Jobs</a>,</i> the enjoyable 2015 drama that provided Michael Fassbender one of the most under-celebrated roles of his career, playing the late Apple co-founder. The poster turns the canvas into a blank screen: the title is typed, the text insertion point poised, waiting for the next key press. As Jobs, Fassbender occupies the bottom right corner, in profile, thinking.</p><p>This starkness makes sense: what’s next, Steve? It offers a rare example of a poster from the past decade that fully leans into the monochrome aesthetic entirely on purpose—to serve the restrained and unequivocal need for white. (And it’s interesting to compare with the marketing narrative for an earlier film about another tech leader: observe how Jesse Eisenberg’s Mark Zuckerberg eyeballs us from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-social-network/\"><i>The Social Network</i></a>’s dark-mode poster.)</p><!--figure[8]--><p>Comfort movies don’t own the white poster, of course. Jordan Peele’s <i>Get Out</i> toys, both in its marketing and its delivery, with the binaries of black and white. It’s deployed on-screen with sophisticated horror, and this extends to its two most graphic poster variants.</p><p>While one poster sees Daniel Kaluuya’s character, Chris, sat on a chair split vertically between black and white, the all-white poster allows only a center-frame letterbox to reveal Chris’s enormous eyes, accompanied by an all-caps type treatment. The vast expanse of white only makes the image more menacing, framing the claustrophobia so effectively. The landscape crop is a device that defines stern dramas as much as arthouse comedies, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hajiabdulkarim/list/lets-make-poster-by-putting-one-picture-or/\">as documented by Haji Abdul Karim in their expansive list</a>.</p><!--figure[9]--><p>But back in the ‘comfort’ realm, we’re seeing more and more that the marketing wants to have it both ways—the negative with the positive; the art house audience <i>and</i> the multiplex crowd. As genres blend, demographics collapse and audiences become more fluid, a film’s advertising needs to speak more languages.</p><p>Two ultra-comfort films from last year demonstrate this idea well. <a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2019/judy_ver2.html\">The poster for <i>Judy</i></a> sees a backlit Renée Zellweger finding her light, receiving her applause. Black is the key color, right down to the classic little black dress; the eye is drawn to the title, spelled out in red sequins. It’s showbiz, it’s drama. Though the film itself fudges a few of the more uncomfortable facts of the star’s story, it’s still honest about her addictions.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/judy-2019/\">In the white-background version</a>, which was more widely distributed, Zellweger, in a floral dress, turns away from the light. The name still sparkles, but in softened gold. There’s no less glamor, the stakes in the film are just as high, but she’s perhaps more accessible like this. The focus, as it was in the 90s, 80s, 40s, returns to the main event.</p><p>Greta Gerwig’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-2019/\">Little Women</a></i>, too, played with dark and light. The indie queen released her previous film, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-bird/\"><i>Lady Bird</i></a>, via design-conscious distributor A24, and Gerwig’s singular aesthetics promised that her <i>Little Women</i> remake would be worlds away from all the others. But when the first images for the film were released, the marketing campaign was questioned by die-hard Gerwig fans.</p><!--figure[10]--><p>Both of the group posters are curiously stripped back, freezing Louisa May Alcott’s beloved March sisters in a moment. In the darker image, they gaze out a window, secure in their festive domestic bubble, but set on what’s beyond. There’s more to life, and the film, than this room. It feels more lush, painterly, certainly more dramatic.</p><p>Whereas <a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2019/little_women_ver2.html\">the white poster</a>, at first, seemed like a mistake. It took one of the first images teased from the film and just&hellip; dropped it onto a poster. The March sisters look as if solidified by clay, entirely undynamic and at odds with the fluidity and warm soul Gerwig had made herself known for in her filmmaking.</p><p>And yet, nothing matters more than these characters. Beth, Jo, Meg and Amy are holding each other, happy, each in their own favourite color, and there is nothing more to fight over. The white-poster alternative lets the 2010s viewer stay attached to the most important part of the film.</p><p>The lessons here? A white poster is a vital sign that you’re safe here. You’ve made the correct choice. Attention spans are dwindling, options are expanding, focus is difficult. The promise of a white frame tells me what matters, what is good, where I should place my time and my value. For now.</p>"

It’s currently topped by 2020 Oscar Best Picture winner <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/\">Parasite</a></i>, a film Letterboxd members were rabid about loooong before it become fashionable.</p><p>And there’s our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/list/official-top-100-documentary-films/\">Official Top 100 Documentary Films</a> list, also maintained by Letterboxd crew member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/\">Jack</a>. The film currently at the top of that list is the singular Brazilian work <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/twenty-years-later/\">Twenty Years Later</a></i> (<i>Cabra Marcado Para More</i>), <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/joelc/film/twenty-years-later/\">described</a> by member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/joelc/\">Joel</a> as a film that “at times … feels like the most important documentary ever made”.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>Filmmaker favorites</b></p><p>We recently invited some of our favorite filmmakers to send us their lists. Writer and director Edgar Wright, the genius behind such classics as <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shaun-of-the-dead/\">Shaun of the Dead</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hot-fuzz/\">Hot Fuzz</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/baby-driver/\">Baby Driver</a></i><i>, </i>created <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/edgar-wrights-100-favorite-comedies/\">this stellar list of one hundred of his favorite comedies</a>, spanning nine decades of mirthsome cinema.</p><p>It’s a bountiful list that gives considerable insight into Wright’s creative mind. In addition to featuring a bevy of bona-fide classics, it shines a light on some mildly under-appreciated recent comedies—films that are loved by everyone who sees them, but that perhaps haven&rsquo;t been seen by quite enough people: Stephen Chow’s insanely charming <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shaolin-soccer/\">Shaolin Soccer</a></i>, rom-com spoof <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/they-came-together/\">They Came Together</a></i> and Lonely Island masterwork <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/popstar-never-stop-never-stopping/\">Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</a>.</i><br/></p><!--figure[2]--><p>After we published Wright’s list on his behalf, he challenged fellow filmmaker Rian Johnson (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-the-last-jedi/\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/knives-out-2019/\">Knives Out</a>) </i>to make a list, and Johnson very much stepped up to the plate with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rcjohnso/list/70s-musical-extravaganza/\">70s Musical Extravaganza</a>!. The list itself, which includes one film per year, is of considerable note, but even more fascinating are <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rcjohnso/list/70s-musical-extravaganza/detail/\">the notes</a> Johnson wrote alongside each entry. That’s where you’ll discover that Johnson hasn’t actually seen Brian De Palma’s cult classic <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/phantom-of-the-paradise/\">Phantom of the Paradise</a></i>—he is holding off doing so until he can watch it in a cinema. Bless.</p><p>Johnson passed the baton to Natasha Lyonne, the actress, writer and director behind last year’s break out Netflix series <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/feverdog/list/russian-doll/\">Russian Doll</a>. </i>She posted <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/animal666/list/i-love-dreams-even-when-theyre-nightmares/\">a list of films </a>guaranteed to mess with your head. These are movies most assuredly not for the faint of heart. (If you’re in a sexier mood, Lyonne’s spicy 1999 rom-com <i>But I’m a Cheerleader </i>appears on film writer Justine Peres Smith’s list of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/MMMO\">best horny movies for quarantine</a>.)</p><p>For families, a raft of award-winning Pixar filmmakers gave us some very helpful lists for families seeking lockdown entertainment, separated into three categories: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/pixar-directors-recommend-films-for-families/\">all ages</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/pixar-directors-recommend-films-for-families-1/\">7–12 years</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/pixar-directors-recommend-films-for-families-2/\">12 years and over</a>, and we cross-checked their selections with the good folk at <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/\">Common Sense Media</a>.

What brought you back? We note that you restarted with your third viewing of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davechen/film/1917/\"><i>1917</i></a>!<br/></b>I am pretty active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davechensky\">Twitter</a> and I started seeing a bunch of screen-capped reviews go viral there. But to be honest, much of social media can be exhausting to me these days. What I realized recently about Letterboxd was that much of it is free of the negativity. It’s just a bunch of folks who love movies sharing thoughts on those movies, but it also feels like a real community of people. There are filmmakers on there who share their thoughts on films and their favorites, and that’s of course endlessly fascinating (such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lilfilm/\">Sean Baker</a>). Even the negative reviews can be fun to read. There’s a lot of pithiness and wit on the site, and its design really helps facilitate that.</p><p><b>Okay, take us way back, what was the film that got you hooked on cinema?<br/></b>My first cinematic true loves were the films of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/john-woo/\">John Woo</a>. I’d watched action movies before but I was introduced to John Woo ironically by a counselor at my church youth group! I became dazzled by movies like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-killer/\"><i>The Killer</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hard-boiled/\"><i>Hard Boiled</i></a>. It was then that I realized that things I had seen dozens of times (e.g., a shootout in a warehouse) could be elevated by sheer craftsmanship.</p><p><b>What keeps you from sharing your four favorites on your profile?<br/></b>A few reasons. For me personally, it takes months if not years for my thoughts on a film to really crystallize. My relationship with a movie doesn’t end when the credits roll—its ideas and themes and images are often clanging around in the back of my head for months if not years afterwards. As a result, my favorite films of all time change pretty frequently and I didn’t want to have to think about maintaining my four favorites over time.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>Is there any film you could say is your all-time number one?<br/></b>If I had to name one though, it’d probably be <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/children-of-men/\"><i>Children of Men</i></a>. It combines all my favorite things into one movie: science fiction, action, Michael Caine and a heartfelt message about how humanity has to be kinder to one another if we are to survive the challenging days ahead.</p><p><b>Your <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davechen/list/movies-in-which-a-highly-respected-auteur/\">most</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davechen/list/movies-based-on-franchises-that-had-a-popular/\">popular</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davechen/list/movies-starring-ewan-mcgregor-in-which-all/\">lists</a> are weirdly specific and fun (but true!). What are some other weirdly specific lists on Letterboxd that spoke to you?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davechen/likes/lists/\">All the lists I like</a> fall into that category. I love it when people make connections that I never otherwise would’ve thought of. To make a funny list, I think you need to be able to juggle extremely specific pattern recognition with a description that makes people feel like they are learning something about the films or their subjects. While the vast majority of the time these are just for fun, sometimes they actually can lead to insights about filmmakers, actors and the specific themes they try to bring to life in their work.</p><p>Also, shout out to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ijsthay/lists/\"></a><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ijsthay/\">Thijs Meuwese</a>, who is leading the way on creative lists.</p><p><b>What is your favorite or most useful feature on Letterboxd?<br/></b>The <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davechen/stats/\">Stats</a> page [generated for all <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pro/\">Pro and Patron</a> members] is a beautiful visualization of the history of my film watching. As I continue to build out my watch history, I’m curious to see the trends that will arise.</p><p><b>What’s a movie where you don’t understand why Letterboxd members love or hate it so much?<br/></b>To answer this question, I took a look at some “worst-rated films on Letterboxd” lists and here’s a totally random one for you: the teen romantic comedy parody <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/not-another-teen-movie/\"><i>Not Another Teen Movie</i></a>. It’s rated a 2.6 and a lot of the humor of this film has aged poorly but there are some amazing gags in here and it features Chris Evans in a performance that will likely be the apex of the comedic phase of his career. My brother and I still quote this movie to each other. Don’t sleep on it.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Your feature film, Stephen Tobolowsky’s one-man show <a href=\"https://boxd.it/aKPo\"><i>The Primary Instinct</i></a>, has a Letterboxd page and a pretty solid rating, congrats! How do you feel having that livestream of instant reactions to it?<br/></b>I’m glad that the ratings are decent, but to be honest, I can’t bring myself to look at them! As part of the filmmaking process, I’m totally open to constructive feedback from people I know and trust, but I’m not sure I can handle the same from strangers. Nonetheless, I’m grateful some Letterboxd members have seen fit to watch the film and take the time to rate it! Perhaps if I make more films in the future, I’ll feel better about checking out the reviews for an individual one.</p><p><b>Among your other skills, you are a talented <a href=\"http://www.davechenmusic.com/\">musician</a>. Can you tell us about some of your favorite film scores? Any cello-heavy scores or composers you find particularly influential?<br/></b>While not really cello-specific, the music of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/nicholas-britell/\">Nicholas Britell</a> makes amazing use of strings (see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moonlight-2016/\"><i>Moonlight</i></a> and [TV series] <i>Succession</i>). His music is achingly beautiful and is often in rotation in my playlists.</p><p>More generally, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/hans-zimmer/\">Hans Zimmer</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/john-williams-2/\">John Williams</a> are both legends and I’ve always found their work to be very interesting. In recent days, I’ve been quite taken with the work of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/daniel-pemberton/\">Daniel Pemberton</a>, whose work on films like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword/\"><i>King Arthur</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-man-from-uncle/\"><i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i></a> have a great populsive energy to them. Finally, when I’m into something more moody, atmospheric or modern, I appreciate the work of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/composer/cliff-martinez/\">Cliff Martinez</a>.</p><p><b>Are you self-isolating right now due to Covid-19? Discovered anything great and new to you to pass the time? We hope everything is alright otherwise!<br/></b>Yes, I&rsquo;m quarantining due to a “stay safe and healthy” order in Washington State right now. Like many people staying at home, I’ve been watching a lot of TV, which includes things like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tiger-king-murder-mayhem-and-madness/\"><i>Tiger King</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/devs/\"><i>Devs</i></a>, <i>Better Call Saul</i>, and <i>Dave</i> (the show on Hulu). These are the things that give me comfort and distraction these days.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What are your go-to comfort movies that you recommend to people at this strange and difficult time?<br/></b>This is a weird recommendation, but I’d say Steven Soderberg’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/contagion/\"><i>Contagion</i></a> is a great choice. <i>Contagion</i> depicts a virus far more deadly than Covid-19, and how it eventually leads to the deterioration of the social order. But it’s also a deeply hopeful movie. You see governments come together to try to figure this thing out. You see the people on the front lines risking their lives to fight the fictional virus and I think it’s a great way to help people understand how courageous and valuable all our medical workers are in times like these. It’s “competence porn” in an era where I think we need to be reminded of what competence looks like.</p><p>[Editor’s note: Dave isn’t alone, <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/613161636990205952/the-curve-contagion\"><i>Contagion</i> has consistently been in our 20 most popular films</a> for the past month.]</p><p><b>When the universe is allowed to go back to the cinema, where do you prefer to sit?<br/></b>As close to the center of the theater as possible, with my eyeline at about halfway up the screen.</p><p><b>What’s in your ‘hall of shame’—the movies you haven’t seen and know Letterboxd will boo at you for missing? Don’t worry, we’ll protect you.<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-1920/\"><i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/say-anything/\"><i>Say Anything</i></a>. Also <i>Firefly</i>, the Joss Whedon show which I don’t think is on your website anywhere. Many people have been complaining to me about this oversight in my viewership for years so I think it’ll do well if we can list it here.</p><p><b>Which film from the past ten years that went by fairly unloved do you think will be a future classic and you’ll fight to the death for loving?<br/></b>I’m going to cheat a little and list a movie that’s eleven years old: Tony Gilroy’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/duplicity/\"><i>Duplicity</i></a>. This movie didn’t do super well at the box office when it was first released and currently has a 2.8 on Letterboxd. But it was one of my top ten films that year. I think Clive Owen and Julia Roberts have great chemistry, but I think the film’s depiction of corporate espionage is outlandish, fun and irresistible. These characters are playing a &ldquo;triple game&rdquo; and it’s so much fun to see the layers upon layers of deception that they’re creating, and the cascading impacts they have on their relationship. Also, how can you say no to a movie that has Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson as competing CEOs literally going at each other?</p><p><b>And finally, please name three other Letterboxd members you recommend we follow.<br/></b>I collaborate with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/oneaprilday/\">Melissa</a> on YouTube/podcast reviews and she is incredibly thoughtful and articulate. I always appreciate <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/khoi/\">Khoi</a>’s thoughtfulness. And <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/shutupmikeginn/\">Mike Ginn</a>—this guy is hilarious.</p>"

So we’ll say it for them: please explore all the films of our contributing filmmakers: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/angus-maclane/\">Angus MacLane</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/domee-shi/\">Domee Shi</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kristen-lester/\">Kristen Lester</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/daniel-chong/\">Daniel Chong</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/peter-sohn/\">Peter Sohn</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/valerie-lapointe/\">Valerie LaPointe</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/brian-fee/\">Brian Fee</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/enrico-casarosa/\">Enrico Casarosa</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/andrew-stanton/\">Andrew Stanton</a>. Thanks, you wonderful people.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>Since many of us at Letterboxd HQ are grateful parents, this feels like a good moment to reflect on the enormous importance of ‘family’ films—so we pulled in our friend Nicola Marshall for a chat. She’s the founder of the <a href=\"https://www.square-eyes.co.nz/\">Square Eyes</a> film foundation, a curator of children’s film festival content, and a friend of the Henson family (not long ago, she created a live show with The Muppets and Flight of the Conchords’ Bret McKenzie).</p><p>Like most of us, Nicola is currently in self-isolation, after the hasty wrap-up of the 23rd annual <a href=\"https://nyicff.org/\">New York International Children’s Film Festival</a> (of which she is an advisory board member).</p><p><b>We’re living in an extraordinary time. How do movies help kids work out what’s going on in and around their lives?<br/></b><i>Nicola Marshall: </i>Films are an essential way to unpack big feelings during big times. Like all of us, kids are expressing, and suppressing, all kinds of emotions right now, and are sponges for absorbing the emotions of the adults around them. Using a familiar medium to help unpack all we’re feeling, no matter how old we are, feels like a great plan to me. Art always supports processing and groundedness in uncertain times.</p><p><b>What’s your overall impression of the choices made by our Pixar friends for these lists?<br/></b>These are brilliant, eclectic selections—what superb curators these remarkable Pixar creators are, right? An excellent mix of films made for young audiences, and titles bound to appeal to them.</p><p>I’m thrilled to see, alongside some beautiful surprises and unknown gems, a lot of long-time personal favorites (<i>Ernest &amp; Celestine, Millions, Ponyo, The Muppet Movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Red Balloon, My Neighbor Totoro, The Kid, Gerald McBoing-Boing, Wallace &amp; Gromit, Modern Times, The Iron Giant, The Phantom Tollbooth, Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory, Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday, Yellow Submarine, Bicycle Thieves, </i>Megan Follows as <i>Anne of Green Gables…</i> they go on!).</p><p>While the lists lean heavily on a canon of western-produced films, there are some terrific international cinema choices in the mix here (<i>The World of Us, Good Morning</i>), and a bunch of lesser-known historic titles I’m super eager to check out (Preston Sturges marathon, here I come!).</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Some of the Pixar directors included horror films—<i>Get Out</i>, <i>It—</i>and some Hitchcock thrillers in their 12 Years and Over lists<i>.</i> These selections are for older teenagers, clearly. What are your thoughts on the role of scares in kids’ viewing experiences?<br/></b>I’ve always been interested in the psychology of frightening films. Personally I’m too much of a big scaredy-cat for horror to be a genre that generally works for me (self-censorship all the way!), but there are a whole bunch of people out there who really love a good freak-out; kiddos included.</p><p>As a kid I think you’re always testing and readjusting your limits on where your fear boundaries are. One of the highly anticipated and super popular NYICFF collections each year is &lsquo;Heebie Jeebies’—short films that go out of their way to freak and fright. Kids (and the adults who attend alongside them) adore this collection and the expectation of being spooked.</p><p>I think humans love experiencing extreme feelings in small doses, to feel alive, whether we have big sensation-seeking personalities or not—and seeing something terrifying on screen has a certain safety to it. I also think scary films in collectively tricky times offer catharsis and adrenal release, and give us permission to scream long and loud, when that’s all we really feel like doing!</p><p><b>The New York International Children’s Film Festival wrapped up suddenly as the coronavirus pandemic began its march into the United States, but you did manage to screen much of the program. Other film festivals weren’t so fortunate. Would you like to take a small moment to celebrate the main takeaways of this year’s fest?</b><br/>NYICFF was so lucky to share three of the planned four collective viewing weekends, just ahead of a swift city-wide shutdown. I’m a tad biased, but I really do feel you only have to look to <a href=\"https://nyicff.org/2020-program/\">NYICFF’s annual programming</a> to get a genuine sense of the state of the world for young people globally; the issues they face and what themes are currently resonating.</p><p>Our programming director Maria-Christina Villaseñor consistently curates a remarkable selection of films that speak to the experience of young people, valuing their views and voices, always insightful, and never condescending.</p><p>This year saw a number of films—feature and short—that depicted stories of kids determined to make a difference and taking self-guided steps into activism and action. My faith in our future is pretty darn solid right now thanks to the optimism and commitment of these kids—and the filmmakers giving voice to young audiences and speaking to big themes and shared cross-cultural truths.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What can the rest of the movie industry learn from all-ages creators and studios?<br/></b>I wish that there was greater wider-industry acknowledgement of the massive contributions that content for family and kids audiences make in terms of moving the overall film industry forward, both artistically and societally. As well as showing us fresh, meaningful and authentic ways to tell stories, the genuine commitment to diversity and inclusion in this space is meaningful, often to the point where it feels completely natural, unforced and expected in content for this audience, rather than some kind of box-ticking effort.</p><p><b>What do you think this pandemic will offer the storytellers of the future?<br/></b>I think we will come out of this time ready to offer stories with even greater connectedness and empathy. I think our collective slowing will allow, if we let it, an incredible development incubator. How we make our way through this uncertain time as adults and work through our relationship with fear and the unknown will hugely resonate with the kids we’re sharing our lives with. I think we can use art and story and myth and expression and feeling to navigate us all through.</p><p>For all those hunkered down with small people, what better time to share your favorite screen stories, and discover new films together. What we chose to watch and to share and to rewatch; to talk about and unpack our feelings around and distract ourselves with through this weird, big time will make a real difference to the kids in our lives, and their innate imaginative-storyteller selves, now and future.</p><p><b>Finally, what are your favorite Pixar movies?<br/></b>Pixar has always excelled at making incredible films with grown-up sensibilities squarely aimed at young audiences—truly cross-generational cinema, my very favorite kind. I love <i><i>WALL·E</i></i> for its seamless mix of art and heart, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brave-2012/\">Brave</a></i> for its representation of girl-strength, and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/inside-out-2015/\">Inside Out</a></i> for exploring the shared humanness of feeling things deeply, and for reassuring us how valid and essential sadness is.</p><p><h2><i>Related content</i></h2></p><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/pixar-shorts-ranked/\">Pixar’s short films ranked according to Letterboxd community ratings</a>. </i></p>"

I mean, obviously, the same thing happened in Spain. It’s a bit of a mess there as well and Greece. But yeah, the housing crisis really is an ongoing thing.</p><p>We made <i>Foxes</i>, a short film, in 2010 roughly but the time it was finished was 2011 and that was already reacting to something that was happening around 2005 which was just increasingly just getting worse. And since making that, made another film, <i>Without Name</i>, which is sort of about a property developer as well. It’s very different, about a guy who’s a surveyor who’s sent out to measure a piece of forest for a shady developer and the forest has a kind of spirit that protects it from this person and it gets psychedelic and weird.</p><p>And then by the time we came around to doing <i>Vivarium</i>, which we’d been working on for a few years just between things and gradually building the script up, it was all back again. We’d come full circle and it’s the exact same problems all over again. So within the film, the film has this kind of cyclical arc to it. It opens with footage of birds that have that kind of lifecycle as well and it seems that we just keep on repeating the same thing as well. It’s the cycle of strangeness.</p><p><b>My partner made an observation about the film, which was when you take away the contemporary issues it’s a very bleak analysis of what it means to be a family or what your purpose in life is.<br/></b>Yeah [laughs]. That’s the existential dread part [more laughs].</p><p><b>How’s your existential dread?<br/></b>I don’t know—we were just tapping into the anxieties of young people to kind of shake them up a little bit. That was an intention. I remember when we started into the script we were thinking what is it that scares people in their late 20s, early 30s these days? What is it that actually scares them as opposed to some sort of big monster? Godzilla was a product of the fear of atomic energy or nuclear war.</p><p>We were trying to coming up with a version in a stranger way of a monster, like the estate agent who would lead you to your doom. And people have this anxiety of moving to the suburbs and getting kind of trapped there and losing all sense of purpose and their life just sort of dwindling away while they repay the mortgage.</p><p><b>You had quite a sort of negative slant on the concept of mortgages.<br/></b>Yeah. That you just pay it off until you die.</p><p><b>Right, you can just dig that hole. Just dig that hole, keep digging that hole.<br/></b>Yeah. Dig the hole. Yeah. Keep on digging. Yeah. I mean to me it’s a big sick joke—the film—in a way. I don’t think it’s necessarily saying you shouldn’t do this, it’s just sort of highlighting how odd it is that we do it and that it’s not a necessarily the only society possibility. There’s other versions, other outcomes could happen. The little girl at the start of the film, Molly—she says she doesn’t like the way things are. So she’s like hope for the next generation.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Your casting of the other child that arrives in Yonder is amazing and you make some really interesting choices of what barriers you present to the audience to make us not really sympathise with the kid. Particularly the modulation of that voice. That voice is fucking weird.<br/></b>It was written as being weird. A weird kind of mimic of them but not quite right. And because he doesn’t have anybody else to copy, it’s kind of a hybrid of voices and we did have to dehumanise him because the real kid did sound quite sweet. He had a lisp as well [laughs]. He’s brilliant.</p><p>So we edited the film with the real kid’s voice and were just thinking about ways of what we’re going to do. And then we had the idea—myself and the editor—that what if we use Johnathan Aris as the voice of the kid because he’s the first estate agent that comes in. And so we got him in to do a little demo and he just did a few lines. And it really worked. It was really weird but it worked. It wasn’t quite right yet but we thought, “Okay. That’s what we’re going to do. when we finish it.” So then when we did we got him in for a whole day and he did the entire film as ADR and then we spent a lot of time in Denmark with the sound mix designer and tweaking that and kind of shifting the pitches and syncing it to his lips and adding in little bits of the little boy on either end of the word like coming in and coming out accenting his lip smacks so that it would sit into his mouth more. It was really tricky but I think it was worth the effort.</p><p><b>I was thinking about how the uniformity of the town of Yonder must have been a real advantage when it comes to shooting. Did you go into this going, “This is great. We’ve got all these advantages because we know we can just reverse this and do that and…”<br/></b>No. No. It was more like a terrible nightmare [laughs]. It’s like being dropped into this thing where you’ve got barely any time to make the film and this is all you have to make what you thought was going to be much bigger. Yeah. It was pretty stressful. It had all been storyboarded and planned a certain way which all had to change there and then with the clock ticking. Actually, on the very first day, there was a power cut because they hadn’t got a generator in Belgium. They were going off the local power and this massive warehouse—there wasn’t a sound stage—and, yeah, the power went for half a day. So we lost half a day the first day which meant the whole schedule was messed up and the storyboards were no longer viable for what we had to shoot. So we had to figure out how to rearrange shots, minimise the amount of coverage to be able to shoot the scenes.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>So much is unseen in the film and that really works to the advantage of the audience. Was it a limitation thing for you or did you know that you could make it more interesting that way?<br/></b>We thought about showing how the whole thing works and all that. We do have our version in our heads, how it all works underneath and the whole lifecycle of these other things. But I found it more interesting to just give little bits of it than show it. What we’d show wouldn’t be as good as what you’d imagine anyway, probably.</p><p><b>I guess it helps if you are on the same page, that you have a bit of architecture in mind.<br/></b>Yeah, exactly. You know what the rules are to the place and all that kind of thing. Like with the weird fluffy clouds. It took people quite a while to get on board with that [laughs]. I was like, “No, it will look good.” And it needed that sort of storybook aesthetic to me anyway, that it’s this sort of surrealist painting, being trapped in that world. Do you remember <i>The Witches</i>—the Roald Dahl film that Nick Roeg directed—and there’s the little girl who’s trapped in the painting by a witch? That had some sort of profound effect on me when I saw it, it looked really creepy to be trapped in something that looked like a painting.</p><p><b>You mentioned <i>The Quiet Earth</i> last night and so I have a parochial responsibility to ask what resonates for you with that film.<br/></b>Well, actually the last sequence part of <i>Vivarium</i> was inspired by that. And also just maybe some of the kind of crossfading or aesthetic. I know it was ’85 or something like that but it had a sort of 70s vibe to it. And the quantum strangeness of <i>The Quiet Earth</i>… <i>Vivarium</i> has that quantum element, things shifting and changing and loops and kind of thing. And the idea of being alone in kind of suburban environments, with nobody else. When we were in development, we were watching everything—all those sci-fis that dealt with similar themes and we really liked <i>The Quiet Earth</i>. Very good performances all and the lead character just being a normal-looking guy which they used to do in the past instead of these kind of Gillette models.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>So this film was obviously, a very difficult process for you. How do you feel about doing more at this point? Did you get PTSD from this experience?<br/></b>I actually probably did for a while, yeah. But yeah, it’s a weird masochistic compulsion. You make a film, you go through agony and then when you finish it you just want to go and do another one. But the next one is potentially less complicated. A little bit more in the real world with elements of the supernatural, and then another one that is a little bit insane, with a location that’s augmented to extend it and make it into sort of an environment but not creating an entire environment. The tricky thing with <i>Vivarium</i> is it always had to have a certain vibe to it and for Yonder to have no wind, no rain, artificial light, and feel very synthetic but at the same time tangible. So I don’t think they’ll be doing another one with quite as limited kind of environment to create and build. Not for a while anyway.</p><p><b>I threatened to bring up <i>Nathan Barley</i> when we first sat down. It feels like an increasingly prescient kind of work. I think sort of an amalgam of sort of cynicism and futurism. What did you take away from your time working on that show and just around Charlie Brooker projects in general?<br/></b>I mean I wasn’t really on <i>Nathan Barley</i>. I went to set a few times and I had to dress up as a lampshade in one episode. Actually, I think it was the first time seeing a director working. It was Chris Morris directing that. I remember he was closing his eyes for a while, thinking about the scene, then he was like, “Okay,” and then got stuck into it again. I thought that was really interesting.</p><p>I did do graphic design in college but I kept on doing narrative work and things. I don’t know why, I just kept on doing things were sort of sequentially telling a story. And then when I was working with those guys, we got hired to make the first mobile video content for video phones that had to come preloaded with content. Charlie’s company had won some sort of contract to make comedy for these phones, both live-action, and animation, but they had tiny budgets. So we were a team of two writers, a designer, an animator, me, and a producer and we had to make all this stuff. I was just supposed to be a runner and then I started editing with them and then we were shooting and then I’d go and have to do some stuff on <i>Nathan Barley</i> and other shows that the production company was doing.</p><p>But I ended up having to make a lot of these live-action comedy sketches and be in them—act in them, shoot them, and edit them, and all that kind of stuff—which was cool because it was like going back to college again, but now making films and doing the kind of opening graphics and all that kind of stuff. So it was a great experience. And nobody saw it anyway [<i>laughs</i>]. I was sent on a course to learn how to use PD150. It’s a little Sony mini-TV camera, and that was that. Got really into making stuff and editing it and all that kind of thing. Good fun.</p>"

Burns, has been floating near the top of Letterboxd’s ‘Popular This Week’ list for the past couple of months. This week, with infection rates soaring and borders closing, it took the top spot.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><!-- more --></p><p><i>Contagion</i> was a solid, fairly well-received film that made decent box-office when it was released a decade ago. Critics noted its focus on the public servants working to identify and lock down the mystery virus, rather than sensational dramatics. (“Feels more like a PSA than a narrative,” observes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jeremiahrivera/film/contagion-2011/\">Jeremiah</a>.) </p><p>Jude Law’s Australian accent aside, the <i>Contagion </i>scenario represented a reality that experts had told Soderbergh and Burns the world should expect from a major new virus. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeryan/status/1238207633837916160\">Speaking to journalist Mike Ryan at the time of the film’s release</a>, Soderbergh—who hasn’t so far commented on <i>Contagion</i>’s revival—said the most disturbing thing in researching the film was that “<i>everyone</i> you spoke to said ‘we’re due for a big one’.”</p><p>And here we are.</p><p><blockquote></p><p>“Last year I reviewed <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/createnopain/film/contagion-2011/\"><i>Contagion</i> </a>and said the scariest part of watching it was that in the back of your head, you know that this could really happen. Well… fuck me.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/createnopain/film/contagion-2011/1/\">Brett</a></p><p></blockquote><!--figure[2]--></p><p><i>Contagion</i>’s<i> </i>resurgent popularity can be seen as a compliment to Burns’ and Soderbergh’s diligent foot-work. <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/contagion-writer-scott-z-burns-reassures-us-about-covid-19.html\">As Burns told <i>Vulture </i>last week</a>: “There’s been some strange shit going on in my social media, where people I’ve never met have done everything from accuse me of being able to travel to the future, to having access to God, to being a member of the Illuminati.”</p><p>Burns has none of those gifts. What he does have, he told <i>Vulture</i>, is relationships with well-respected scientists, including epidemiologist Dr. Larry Brilliant (who was on the team that managed to defeat smallpox) and Columbia University’s Dr. Ian Lipkin, who refused to take part “unless what we did was scientifically authentic and verifiable. So from the beginning, I knew that I had to stay within the lines of what was possible.”</p><p><blockquote></p><p>“<i>Contagion</i> makes real life less scary in the sense that Covid-19 is way less dangerous than the fictional virus. But it makes life more scary because Jude Law’s character is basically the President now.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bberg/film/contagion-2011/1/\">Brian</a></p><p></blockquote></p><p>Reading recent Letterboxd reviews, it’s easy to understand why we’re all watching <i>Contagion</i> right now: to figure out our current reality; to understand how Covid-19 has spread; to learn what our responsibilities are; to  marvel at the sight of comedian Demetri Martin in a hazmat suit; and to put faces to the many thousands of health workers, scientists and government officials who will help us out of this crisis. (“It’s like competence porn,” says <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ianamurray/film/contagion-2011/2/\">Iana</a>.)</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>What’s interesting in more recent reviews is the shift in attitudes towards <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jakepcole/film/contagion-2011/1/\">the film’s style and structure</a>. When <i>Contagion</i> was first released, audiences and critics often pushed against the clinical plotting, not to mention Soderbergh’s plainly brutal camera technique—isolating characters in the frame; jump-cuts to quickly advance a character’s fate. Whereas now, it’s exactly this hyper-realism that’s giving us, if not comfort, then at least the dose of frankness we need to be able to stick to our necessarily isolated lifestyles, and avoid the mistakes made in the movie (there’s plenty of food to go round, yo—no need to ransack the local grocery store).</p><p><blockquote></p><p>“How this movie has a 3.3 here baffles me. This is a 4.1—a non-stop, ‘who’s-who-of-Hollywood’ pulse-pounder that worked even before every scene became highly relevant to our pandemic. Its filmmaking feels like a virus; it moves fast and exponentially—without empathy or hand-holding. Characters appear and disappear like tweets—here one moment, dead the next. Wash your hands.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aneeshchaganty/film/contagion-2011/\">Aneesh Chaganty</a></p><p></blockquote></p><p>Indeed, Burns told <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2020/03/contagion-movie-coronavirus-interview-screenwriter-scott-z-burns.html\">Slate</a> last week, “one of the beautiful things I learned while doing my research is what public health really means. What I came to understand it to be was an obligation we have to each other.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>“Until we have a pharmaceutically generated or a scientifically generated cure, <i>we</i> are the cure. We can be the cure. It means listening to public health officials and being conscious of your obligation to your fellow humans.”</p><p>But Letterboxd reviewer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jordanmagill13/film/contagion-2011/\">Jordan</a> needs <i>Contagion</i>’s<i> </i>popularity to settle down now. “I need people to stop reviewing this movie. This is the social media platform I’m using to escape thinking about the coronavirus.”</p>"

It also has a contemporary thread, and that just became a prologue and we settled into the 1820s. We found the main mechanism, the cow, which doesn’t exist in the novel—in the novel they’re selling the oil from beaver glands to China. So once we had the narrative element of the cow, we could work our own way into the script while still using a lot of the themes and stories from John’s novel. And the other thing John did, which was great, was to combine two characters from the novel. King Lu is actually a fusion of two people in the novel.</p><p><b>On paper, <i>First Cow</i> might seem like a straightforward Western but in practice it feels much softer. How do you see it in terms of genre?<br/></b>I didn’t feel any limits by a genre, and I wasn’t really thinking of it as a ‘big W’ Western. I actually see it as a heist film if anything. When I made <i>Meek’s Cutoff</i>, we were dealing with bonnets and wagons and the desert and people crossing West. That felt like having to deal with the whole history of the Western while we set up the camera, but I didn’t feel like that at all here. I just felt like we were telling an intimate story about two people. We were in the minutiae of trying to find out as much as we could about the Multnomah tribes that lived on the Columbia river, and we had fashioned Toby Jones’ character—the Chief Factor—after John McLoughlin in the [retail business group] Hudson’s Bay Company. It was more about researching the beaver trade and definitely taking artistic liberties, while also really trying to stay pretty true in the details to the period. It was such a little world we were building, I didn’t really have the feeling that I was confined in a genre at all.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>You work with outdoor landscapes a lot, particularly in Oregon. There are similarities with <i>Meek’s Cutoff</i> but also with <i>Wendy and Lucy</i>—the nomadic loners, the animal companion… What keeps you coming back to these places?<br/></b>I’ve actually worked outdoors much more than I’ve worked indoors. It’s really the indoors which was really fun to shoot here, because with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/production-design/anthony-gasparro/\">Tony Gasparro</a>, who was the production designer on <i>First Cow</i>, he and I were able to design these cottages and interiors and build around what [we] wanted to shoot, which is really great and a first for me. But outdoors is where I’m usually mostly shooting. It was recognizable to me at different points in the film that we were recalling <i>Old Joy</i> and <i>Meek’s Cutoff</i> and <i>Wendy and Lucy</i>. It was like the ‘Best Of’ of my movies.</p><p>There were some echoes of the other films for sure. It’s interesting to think how that’s happened. Because really, John’s novel <i>The Half-Life</i> is the first thing I ever read of his, and I wrote to him asking if he had any short stories—because I knew the novel was too big back in 2004—and he sent me <i>Old Joy</i>, the short story, which became the first thing we did together. But in between all that we’d been musing together for a decade, whenever there’s a lull in whatever we’re working on, we’d ask ourselves how we could do <i>The Half-Life</i>. It’s been cooking on the back burner for a long time, so maybe it’s bled into other films along the way.</p><p><b>Would you ever consider working in the city?<br/></b>I’m definitely ready to do something contemporary. It could be anything. I will just say on the practical side I do enjoy going away with a crew and feeling somewhat off the grid while making a film, separate from everyday life. When you say a city, I immediately think of New York. Never say never, but it’s just the practicalities of it… even if you can hire the crew you want, it doesn’t jump out at me as the most inviting thing.</p><p><b>In <i>First Cow</i>, your central characters are two men. Did you encounter different things in delving into male psychology after shaping so many rich female characters across your filmography?<br/></b>I don’t think of it in terms of gender, more in terms of personality. Maile Meloy’s short stories that I was working off for <i>Certain Women</i> focus on isolated women, a theme in some of her writing. But it’s really more about getting down to details on all levels of filmmaking for me. You have at some point the bigger picture, but I like to get down to the nitty gritty of things, in the story I’m telling and the people I’m making the story about and not worry about what gender anybody is. It’s more about who are these characters. A big draw to <i>The Half-Life</i> was that the Cookie character was so great. King Lu was totally fascinating as well. So it was more about keeping track of what they wanted, what they were to each other in the minute-by-minute, more even than in the big sense.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Evie, the titular cow, is a terrific performer. What is your favorite animal performance on film?<br/></b>Oh god… Lucy! My own beautiful dog in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/old-joy/\">Old Joy</a></i> (2006), actually. No, of course there’s others. The animal that probably made the biggest impression on me as a kid was in Mike Nichols’ <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-day-of-the-dolphin/\"><i>The Day of the Dolphin</i></a> (1973). That dolphin was everything. You’re always afraid the animals are going to come to some demise. There’s [Vincente] Minnelli’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/home-from-the-hill/\">Home from the Hill</a></i> (1960), which has the tragic hunting dog there. But it’s such a beautiful film. Whenever a film is named after the animal, you know it’s bad news for the animal.</p><p><b>Do you have a favorite film to teach your students?<br/></b>I’ve been teaching since 1998 so I wouldn’t call anything a favorite, but one film I’ve used in a sound class a lot is the opening scene of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mccabe-mrs-miller/\">McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</a></i> (1971), where we’re just listening to the sound, and we turn off the image and the students describe the space. And so by doing that over the years I have René Auberjonois’ voice so firmly planted in my head, as he’s the bartender in the opening scene. I had the great pleasure of working with him on <i>Certain Women</i> and we wrote a little part for him [in] <i>First Cow</i> where he’s the cranky guy in town with the raven.</p><p><b>What is the film that made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b>When I was a kid and I saw <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/what-ever-happened-to-baby-jane/\">Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</a></i> (1962) on TV, and there was a scene on a beach at night that happened in black and white. It was the first time I’d seen the ocean in black and white—I grew up in Miami. It was the first time I became aware that people could do something as far as film went. I think when I was in art school, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/stranger-than-paradise/\">Stranger Than Paradise</a></i> (1984) came out, and it probably opened the door to a lot of people’s minds—like a lot of people who saw the first band who played their own music and not cover tunes, like, ‘maybe I could tell my own story on film’. It made something seem possible, for myself anyway.</p>"

What drew you back to Georgia and those difficult circumstances?<br/></b><i>Levan Akin:</i> I come from a background of making bigger projects, and this wasn’t obviously what a person like me should be doing next. I did a lot of Swedish TV, but I had grown tired of working the way I did. I started working for [Swedish film and commercial director] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/roy-andersson/\">Roy Andersson</a> when I was 22 and then I went into TV—I never went to film school. I applied twice and I didn’t get in! I was brought up in the SVT [Swedish public broadcasting service] way of making TV series. You have a script, you break it down, sometimes you write it yourself, sometimes you don’t, you do the shot list, you work with the actors, you block the scene and you move on and that’s all fine and good.</p><p>But after my previous film I was very tired. I was 36 then, and had sort of forgotten why I was making films. I had seen this Pride parade, the one where they were attacked in Georgia in 2013, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So I went to Georgia and did some research with my own little camera, and it very organically developed into this film. I never sat down and thought I’d write a story about this dancer. I used what happened around me, and I found a lot of real people. We often weren’t allowed to film in places a lot of the time—we made up stories about what we were doing. We had to have bodyguards, we’d lose locations on a day’s notice. It was insane, so I couldn’t plan out the movie like I would normally.</p><p>I wanted to make a very classical story, a very universal story and have the motor be [Merab’s] first love for Irakli and that setting him free. And then I filled it with things that happened while I was working. I’ve never worked like that, but I think it’s the best film I’ve made, and it’s really been a rejuvenation of my creative energy. Someone told me, “You are one person when you make the film, another when it’s over”. And that’s really the case with this film, it’s changed me fundamentally.</p><p><b>One character in <i>And Then We Danced</i> says, “Georgian dance is based on masculinity”. What are the defining traits of masculinity in Georgia?<br/></b>The definition of masculinity is so different in different cultures. In Sweden, where I live, if two men just hug too much or walk arm in arm, it’s considered super un-masculine. It’s like the whole thing about how young boys fight each other because that’s the only way they can be close in Western society. Whereas in Georgia, you can sit in someone’s lap and it’s not considered gay or un-masculine. Over there, traits like being very poetic, being a dancer, being a good singer, things that might be feminine in our culture are considered very masculine.</p><p>I thought that was interesting for the film because the regular story might have been, “I want to be a dancer but my family doesn’t want me to because it’s considered to be a feminine job”. Whereas here it’s the opposite, it’s, “I am a dancer, and I can’t be gay”.</p><p><b>Why was it important to use dance as a narrative vehicle to show these changing identities?<br/></b>What they say in the film is that Georgian dance has evolved. It’s based on old folk dances from different regions of the Caucasus, other Caucasian countries too, as well as Georgia. The dances from Batumi have a lot of oriental influences, originally even more than now. And the Kintouri dance was originally created by a queer group of people who lived in Georgia 100 years ago, and they were people working in service jobs.</p><p>Men wouldn’t take those jobs because it was considered unmanly, so the ones who worked in those jobs were gay guys or queer, some were even trans. They developed this dance and it’s sort of like a <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/paris-is-burning/\">Paris Is Burning</a></i>. Everybody knew they were gay. That’s what the teacher says in the film, when he says “they were softer but we made them harder”, because then these dances were appropriated by three big ensembles, and they did alterations to them.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>How did that influence the message you ultimately wanted to share?<br/></b>The film is about finding your own place in a traditional society, and not letting anyone tell you what your traditions ought to be, or how you ought to define yourself, to be accepted as a Georgian. That discourse is all around us now. I’m really frankly tired of people telling me that, for instance, I’m not really Swedish because my parents came from Georgia, and I have a Muslim background. Also, Georgia is 90 percent predominantly Christian Orthodox now, so a lot of Georgians think you can’t be Georgian if you’re not a Christian.</p><p><b>There are two major contemporary music cues in the film—ABBA’s ‘Take A Chance on Me’ and Robyn’s ‘Honey’. How did those two come to be?<br/></b>During the Soviet Union, there was an ABBA concert on TV and I think that was one of the only one Western pop concerts that was broadcast in Soviet. I think it had to do with Sweden being social democratic, and we had sort of a good relationship with the Soviet Union so they thought, “Ok, we can show this, at least it’s not American”. It would be on every New Year’s Eve and it would be like a tradition.</p><p>So when the Soviet Union fell, ABBA had a new market with new people who also loved ABBA. So ABBA is actually very popular in Georgia! Of course ABBA is super-expensive to [license], and we had literally no money when we made this film—it was a very hard shoot. But <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/ludvig-andersson/\">one of the producers of the film</a> is the son of Benny Andersson of ABBA… I figured if he likes the film, for them it’s not a big risk. I thought, I’ll try it in the rough cut and either he’ll like it and say yes or he won’t—but he loved the movie, he was crying afterwards.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>I’d also taken a risk with Robyn because that album had just come out, and we all love Robyn. We just hoped she’d like it and accept it, because we couldn’t pay her very much. Thankfully she did, and also we actually got help from Jen Malone. She’s a music supervisor and she’s so talented, and she’s the one who does the music supervision for [bands including] Euphoria, Creed and so on, so once she also got in touch she made it work for us. I’m eternally grateful to Jen.</p><p><i>[The following answers contain spoilers for several of the movies mentioned by Akin.]</i></p><p><b><i>And Then We Danced</i> has many beautiful dance sequences. Which specific dance scenes, or dance movies broadly, inspire you?<br/></b>I love <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg/\">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a></i> as a whole, and it has dancing in it, so that’s an easy one. In <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dirty-dancing/\">Dirty Dancing</a>,</i> I love the last dance, I can watch it over and over. It’s an amazing scene in every way. I also love the scene in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ex-machina-2014/\">Ex Machina</a></i> where [Oscar Isaac] is dancing. It’s so nice, and so sexy.</p><p>I don’t know if there was dancing in it but I really want to mention this film—I love <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl/\">The Diary of A Teenage Girl</a></i>. Marielle Heller is a genius. And Bel Powley and Alexander Skarsgård, they’re just so good in those parts. He was incredible! That should have won all the Oscars. In my films I never have clear antagonists, even if there are characters antagonizing the main character. I love them all, there’s no clear moral compass, everyone is just trying to do their best with the circumstances. It’s the same with this film. I love that you understand and love Alexander Skarsgård, and the guilt Minnie must have been feeling. It’s just so sensitively directed, with such a precise feeling of how to not veer in any one direction. If anyone is just shaking somewhere in that film, let’s put it in this ranking!</p><p>There’s this amazing documentary made by a Swedish documentarian, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/martha-niki/\"><i>Martha &amp; Niki</i></a>. It’s about two friends who are dancers, two black girls from Sweden. Their friendship is really complicated, and they’re competing in a special dance, and you just follow them as they’re touring and competing. One of the girls is from Uganda, if I remember correctly, and another one is adopted, so they also have very different social backgrounds. I saw it in cinemas and I was just sitting and crying.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>What are your favorite on-screen gay love stories?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brokeback-mountain/\">Brokeback Mountain</a></i>. I saw that movie in New York in 2005 and I was so shocked. I just thought, “What the fuck have I just been through”? The ending… Nowadays, I would never want to kill off a character in a gay movie, but then, it’s so vague that you don’t even know what happens to them. It breaks my heart, it still does.</p><p>I really enjoyed <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gods-own-country-2017/\">God’s Own Country</a></i>. I thought it was really moving and touching. Josh O’Connor is a revelation, and the other guy [Alec Secareanu] is amazing too. They have great chemistry. It’s just so delicately made.</p><p>I also love the Wachowski sisters’ <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bound/\">Bound</a></i>. I remember when I saw it, oh my god. Back then, seeing that was really something. I love Jennifer Tilly, what a star!</p><p>In terms of a movie that gay communities really love: <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/romy-and-micheles-high-school-reunion/\">Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion</a>.</i> I’ve seen it literally a thousand times, I just rewind it and watch it again. It’s so amazing. When we were younger, 50 percent of the lines we would say would be lines from that film. It’s hilarious. It’s such a great story about friendship. If you haven’t seen it, congratulations, you have so much to look forward to!</p><p>And how did I almost forget <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/my-own-private-idaho/\"><i>My Own Private Idaho</i></a>?! I saw that as a kid in the 90s, and it’s just so amazing. River Phoenix. What a movie.</p><p><b>Could you give the Letterboxd community a primer to some great Georgian films?<br/></b>I love <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/my-happy-family/\">My Happy Family</a></i>, a film by Simon Groß and Nana Ekvtimishvili. They’re a directing couple. They did another film called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/in-bloom/\">In Bloom</a>;</i> about a teenage girl, it’s sort of autobiographical I can imagine, as it feels very lived. It’s about a Georgian girl in the 90s. Both films were at Sundance—<i>My Happy Family</i> was there three years ago and I think it won an award. [It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize, and was Georgia’s entry for the 2013 best foreign language Academy Award]. Netflix bought it, so it’s on there now.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>It really shows this thing in Georgia where there is no private sphere. Families live together inter-generationally for life for many reasons—financial ones for sure. It’s the story of this woman who lives with her mother, her father, her children, everybody is in that house. She decides that one day she wants to move into her own apartment, and it’s the most shocking thing anyone has ever heard of. She says she just wants to sit alone and read books and have her own space, and everyone is so provoked by that because that can’t happen in Georgia.</p><p>There’s another Georgian film I love called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/street-days/\">Street Days</a></i>, by Levan Koguashvili, which came out in 2010. It was one of the first new-generation movies in Georgia showing the reality of Georgia the way it was then. It’s the story of a man who is struggling to support his family, but he’s also a drug addict. It sounds really bleak but it’s made with such dark humor.</p><p>To go really far back to the directors working through the Soviet time, there’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wishing-tree-1976/\">The Wishing Tree</a></i> by Tengiz Abuladze. So many shots from that film are so, so beautiful. It’s set in the rural parts of Georgia, and it’s about a young girl who falls in love with a boy, but they can’t be married because she has to marry an older person because it’s better for the family. And the boy she was in love with was killed by the husband. She goes insane, because she keeps thinking about it all the time; she’s talking to his ghost. This old woman in the village hears her and thinks she’s cheating on her husband, so they decide to do this ritual where they stone her. It’s so sad and so beautiful, and there’s a woman in the village who’s like the town fool but she’s the only one making sense. It’s so poetic.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/sergei-parajanov-1/\">Sergei Parajanov</a> is another of my all-time favorite directors—I love <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-color-of-pomegranates/\">The Color of Pomegranates</a></i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ashik-kerib/\"><i>Ashik Kerib</i></a>. He’s a great surrealist director and has inspired many directors since, such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/tarsem-singh/\">Tarsem Singh</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mark-romanek/\">Mark Romanek</a>, who did a lot of music videos in the 90s. Madonna’s video for ‘Bedtime Stories’ was really inspired by Parajanov. He worked a lot with tableaux, and it’s so queer. [Parajanov] was gay and he was imprisoned for it many times. He was very close friends with<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/andrei-tarkovsky/\"> [Andrei] Tarkovsky</a> and he attributes his artistry to being inspired by him, saying that Tarkovsky released his creativity. They were close, but they’d also fight a lot. One time Parajanov told Tarkovsky, “You can never be as amazing a director as me, because you’re not a homosexual”, which is funny!</p><p><b>Finally, what was the film first made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b>I love that question. It feels like I’m closing a circle because I think the movie I’m thinking of has some similarities with my movie. It’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/some-kind-of-wonderful/\">Some Kind of Wonderful</a>,</i> [written] by John Hughes and directed by Howard Deutch. It’s not one of the most famous John Hughes movies but it’s one of the first ones I saw in the cinema. I think I was seven years old, I went with my older sister who was eleven at the time.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p>It’s a love triangle between Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson and Lea Thompson. Stoltz plays this working-class kid, he lives on the wrong side of the tracks, the classic perspective that’s always in John Hughes movies. He’s in love with the popular girl in school, Amanda Jones. She is also from his part of the town but is dating the rich guys. He’s really in love with her, and his best friend is played by Masterson, she’s called Watts but her nickname is Drummer Girl, and she’s a tomboy. When I was little I thought she was a boy who was a gay character. I didn’t understand that she was a girl because I’d never seen a girl like that as a kid. It’s just a great movie, it was a love triangle before love triangles were boring. I don’t know if it consciously made me want to direct films, but it was the first film that I saw that that stuck with me.</p><p>We didn’t have a lot of movie culture in my house, my parents emigrated to Sweden in the late 60s. My father read a lot, but we didn’t come from any culture. The films I’d find were the ones you could rent in the local store. Mostly American movies. The more highbrow stuff came later when I was older and could search them out myself.</p>"

I rely on ratings to add stuff to my watchlist, and I rate to let others know if I liked the film. I don’t read reviews for films I haven’t seen, so without user ratings I’d be snookered.</p><p><b>Tell us about your</b> <b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lise/list/march-around-the-world-2020-brazil/\">March Around The World challenge</a>, in which Letterboxd members sign up to watch and review 30 films from 30 different countries during the month of March</b><b>. How did it come about, and what’s involved?<br/></b>I took over the challenge from Berken, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bruckbruck/list/may-30-days-30-countries-challenge-or-around/detail/\">who created it and hosted it for the first year</a>. I thought it was a brilliant way to explore the world on the cheap. The review component is important because it expands Letterboxd’s database, especially for under-seen films. It’s been a great success. Many participants <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tag/30-countries-2020/lists/\">like to create lists</a>, and if they can’t watch them all in March they go at it for the rest of the year, which is great. The most important rule about the challenge is to forget the rules and watch international films during the month.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>What are some of the interesting statistics you’ve noticed from your Marches Around the World?<br/></b>I <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KH81xLik5BCYII7Mf4KSm1ZSk700NMz7q-GjPC00KII/edit#gid=0\">consolidated all of the spreadsheets</a> I’ve created for each challenge, and there were some surprises. The most viewed film is <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/touki-bouki/\">Touki-Bouki</a></i> from Senegal (average rating of 3.7). Less surprising is that our most-viewed director is Ingmar Bergman (although I was happy to see Aki Kaurismäki from Finland in second place). The most-viewed countries are France, Japan and South Korea. Another surprise, the best decade is the 1920s (with the 1950s in a close second).</p><p><b>How has March Around the World enhanced your life?<br/></b>I’m not the sentimental type but when we get a new participant in the challenge I get the warm and fuzzies. If the genie were out of the bottle I would request that all overcome the ‘one-inch barrier’ (subtitles). Watching films ‘from away’, as our East Coasters would say, is one of the simplest ways to combat fears and/or prejudices about other peoples/nations/ways of life that we often don’t realize we have. Every time we identify or root for someone who is ‘other’ it chips away at the walls, and as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/maya-angelou-and-still-i-rise/\">Maya Angelou</a> has said so eloquently, we discover that “We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike”.</p><p><b>What are the responsibilities involved in hosting a Letterboxd challenge?<br/></b>It doesn’t have to be complicated. A challenge can be as simple as “watch ten films from your watchlist this month”. It’s all about tags. Define a tag, have people add it to their films and their lists, and then you can easily search for and filter those tags. Easy peasy. Mine is a bit more challenging because it has so many requirements, but thanks to some fantastic Letterboxders who volunteer to help with my spreadsheet (you know who you are), it all gets done in a timely manner.</p><p><b>How do you find the time to watch all those films in a single month?!<br/></b>Jonathan and I have never completed the challenge! Our best year was around 26. That year we got up earlier in the morning and watched the films with coffee, before going to work. That was the best. Nice and fresh and open to anything. Bonus is that we got to think about the film all day and the review-writing in the evening was easier. If it were up to me that’s the way I would watch films all the time.</p><p><b>What other challenges have you taken part in, and how have they enhanced your experience of watching films?<br/></b>Back in the day everyone was making a list tagged with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tag/list-of-shame/lists/\">List of Shame</a> that you filled with all those “You seriously haven’t seen that yet?!” films. I’m still chipping away at it, but of course for every film you watch there are ten more you have to see. To help with the List of Shame I participated in Mr Dulac’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6gTY\">5×5 series</a>, where you selected five films from five directors and watched them at your leisure. It was a great way to complete filmographies. I still go to that list when selecting a film to watch.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>What are your four favorites on your Letterboxd profile, and why?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/in-the-mood-for-love/\">In the Mood for Love</a></i>, because forbidden love is the saddest thing ever, and I could watch Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung go up and down those noodle-shop stairs all day long. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-thin-red-line/\">The Thin Red Line</a></i>, because it provides a great sense of place and it’s about the soldiers, not the war. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-whispering-star/\">Whispering Star</a></i> because it is so quiet and touching.</p><p>I keep my fourth slot open for a rotating new favorite film that I want everyone to see. I could change these for a different set, but, oh, who am I kidding. I always feel terrible at the thought of ‘demoting’ a film.</p><p><b>What is your favorite or most useful feature?<br/></b>The watchlist, filtered by service. <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/188034631913/justwatch-integration\">It is my dream-come-true feature</a>. I sort by genre, hide short films, select ‘Stream only’ and ta-da! A list of films I’ve been meaning to see that are available to stream. (Now if only I could do the same for films that I own!) <i>[Editor’s note: filtering by your own personal set of streaming services is a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pro/\">Pro feature</a>.]</i></p><p><b>What’s a movie you’ve done a 180 on because of other Letterboxd members’ opinions?<br/></b>Great question. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/memories-of-murder/\">Memories of Murder</a></i> is one of them for sure. I couldn’t figure out what the big deal was when I first saw it, but so many of my friends gave it five stars that I watched it again and understood. And just this week, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/moaning_slug/\">Moaning_Slug</a> posted an interesting comment on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lise/film/viridiana/\">my review of Buñuel’s <i>Viridiana</i></a> that actually makes me want to take another look.</p><p><b>What’s a movie you’ve really had to dig in on your feelings about, despite what everyone else on Letterboxd thinks?<br/></b>I am not easily bothered by or influenced by others when it comes to the films I love or despise. I seriously disliked <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/her/\">Her</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/boyhood/\">Boyhood</a></i> and pretty much anything by Wes Anderson and all the high ratings have zero effect on me. The technical prowess of a film would never be something that could change my mind (here’s looking at you <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/john-wick-chapter-2/\">John Wick: Chapter 2</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/john-wick-chapter-3-parabellum/\">3</a></i>). What would make me take a second look is if someone were able to point out that I missed something about what the film was <i>saying</i>. I’ve yet to review <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Jojo Rabbit</a></i> because while I think poking fun at someone who aspires to dictatorship might actually prevent it from happening, I don’t know what to make of it when it’s making light of a historical or current [aspiring dictator]. Reading reviews about this could definitely influence my take on the film.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What’s your go-to comfort movie?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pride-and-prejudice-1995/\">The one with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy</a>, the one with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy/\">Chris Pratt and the talking ‘rat’</a>, and the one with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/chungking-express/\">Tony Leung as badge No. 663 starring the Mamas and the Papas</a>.</p><p><b>If and when you go to the cinema, where do you prefer to sit?<br/></b>Behind the shortest person in the room, near the back (I hate looking up—it’s a neck thing).</p><p><b>You’re Canadian.

And I must mention these NFB short classics: <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bETCusT5kNM\">The Cat Came Back</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZyDsF-Gp3o\">The Sweater</a></i> and one of the most beautifully animated shorts, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTvYh8ar3tc\"><i>The Man Who Planted Trees</i></a>.</p><p><b>When</b> <b><i>Parasite</i></b> <b>won Best Picture, what was the reaction in your household?<br/></b>We tested the bounce on our floor boards at Best Director.

I think everyone should follow <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/punq/\">Punq</a> for the sheer number of films he watches and reviews, but mostly because I don’t think there is a film made before the 60s that he hasn’t seen. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/gdw/\">Graham Williamson</a> is a good bet as well. His tastes are eclectic and his reviews are always packed with good observations and information. And I also have to recommend fellow Canuck <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/obligatory/\">puffin</a>. I don’t know how he manages to watch so many films <i>and</i> review them. I always enjoy reading <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/oneaprilday/\">Melissa Tamminga</a>, who asks questions and is very thoughtful in her reviews, and I have a soft spot for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/peterhildebrand/\">Peter H</a>, who again personalizes his reviews. Nepotism be damned, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jrwhite\">Jonathan White</a> always writes honest, interesting and personal reviews.</p><p><b>You also <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lise/list/letterboxd-in-toronto-tiff/\">round up Letterboxd members who attend TIFF each year</a>—what’s been a good thing about meeting Letterboxd people in real life?<br/></b>It’s great! Without naming names, I discovered that I could drink a 6'2&quot; Norwegian under the table; a particular New Yorker is so stingy with his ratings that when he gives anything beyond three and a half stars you just <i>have</i> to watch the film; and a New Zealander personally knows anyone who is anyone in the industry over there and can give you all the dirt! Whenever we consider not doing TIFF we are always reminded that it would involve missing our Wednesday meet-up (as well as most other nights where we undoubtedly meet up for beer and film-related arguments), and we easily change our minds.</p><p>P.S. In the spirit of connecting Letterboxders… before the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Xmkq\">TIFF list</a> I thought it would be good idea to create a ‘Letterboxd in [insert City]’ list, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lise/list/letterboxd-in-toronto/\">Toronto</a> being the first one. It took off, and many users from different parts of the world created lists for their cities; the tag is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tag/letterboxdcity/lists/\">letterboxdcity</a>.</p>"

As of leap year 2020, this type of movie will henceforth be known as a Goode Film.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>In 2010, which was not a leap year, a romantic comedy named <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/leap-year/\"><i>Leap Year</i></a> was released. It starred Amy Adams and Matthew Goode, a piece of casting chemistry that a particular corner of the Letterboxd community regards to this day as “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/iaiaiand/film/leap-year/2/\">a fanfic come to life</a>”. “Turgid” is how Goode described <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/leap-year/\"><i>Leap Year</i></a> at the time of its release.</p><!--figure[1]--><p>Goode took the job, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/baftas/7291210/Bafta-Awards-2010-Matthew-Goode-Interview.html\">he told <i>The Telegraph</i></a>, because the Irish location was close to his London home. “It wasn’t because of the script, trust me,” he went on, no doubt causing absolutely zero offence to writing partners Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont. “Was it a bad job? Yes, it was. But, you know, I had a nice time and I got paid.”</p><p>Letterboxd wasn’t around when <i>Leap Year</i> came out, but we’re here now to definitively reassure Matthew Goode that there are plenty of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/leap-year/reviews/by/entry-rating/\">five-star <i>Leap Year</i> lovers out here</a> rooting for this cultural collision between two heterosexual white people battling to understand each other’s accent.</p><p>The white people in question are Goode and Adams, with Adam Scott in the supporting role of man-Amy’s-character-shouldn’t-marry. Adams’ Anna hears of the Celtic tradition ‘allowing’ (barf) women to pop the “will you marry me?” question to their lovers on leap days, so she follows Jeremy (Scott) from America to Ireland, only to wind up in a car for the rest of the movie with surly Irish bartender Declan (the very English Goode). You can guess the rest.</p><!--figure[2]--><p>For context, 2010 was the same movie season in which Tom Ford’s celebrated <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-single-man/\">A Single Man</a></i> was doing the rounds, with Goode in an important supporting role, indicating a shift away from the somewhat lighter comedy fare he’d logged to date. Adams already had a respectable track record, but her very best (and most serious) work was still ahead of her—therefore, it was the correct moment in an actress’s life to lead a rom-com. As for Adam Scott, his first <i>Parks and Recreation</i> season had only recently begun airing, and his film career was still very much in indie mode. This would be one of his earliest ‘<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/emilyward749/list/films-where-adam-scott-plays-an-asshole/\">asshole mode</a>’ outings.</p><p><i>Leap Year</i>’s reviews at the time were, well, let’s just say it led to one of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/arto/list/mark-kermodes-greatest-rants/\">Mark Kermode’s greatest rants</a> (he was not a fan). But hindsight, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/carminis/film/leap-year/1/\">it’s a thing</a>, especially with a cast like that. Let’s not forget, either, that with the (slowly) changing face of film critics comes a changing appreciation of movies targeted to specific (in this case, female) audiences.</p><p>On Letterboxd, <i>Leap Year</i> sits at a very respectable number 22 on Caitlin’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/caityperrie/list/the-definitive-rom-com-ranking-by-the-queen/\">definitive rom-com ranking</a> thanks, she writes, to “low-key one of the hottest on-screen pairings ever”. The film can also be found on Drucilla’s extremely popular <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/drucilla/list/a-comprehensive-guide-to-romantic-comedies/\">comprehensive guide to romantic comedies</a>, Maria Luisa’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/marialuisacctc/list/women-have-superior-taste-that-is-why-these/\">delightfully color-coordinated chick flicks list</a> (with the important note: “lack of diversity is a reflection of the industry”), and Holly-Beth’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jurassicstark/list/good-modern-rom-coms/\">good modern rom-coms</a>.</p><p><i>Leap Year</i> turns up on this <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/soundturnedlow/list/a-list-of-unconvincing-irish-accents/\">list of unconvincing Irish accents</a> (it could have been worse: Goode’s accent started out too thick, which made him sound feral, leading him to <a href=\"https://www.amc.com/talk/2010/01/qa-leap-years\">dial it back</a>). But the film also boasts the definitive rom-com themes ‘<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/carbar123/list/hate-to-love-the-best-trope-needs-to-be-updated/\">hate to love</a>’ (characters who go from enemies to friends) and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/carbar123/list/the-pretend-relationship-trope/\">fake relationship trope</a>, which makes it a not-bad rom-com overall.</p><p>Other things you love about <i>Leap Year</i>: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/danibacon/film/leap-year/\">the Rom, the Com, the old Irish men who bicker</a>; <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/svvspiria/film/leap-year/\">Amy Adams</a>; <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/artgrantaire/film/leap-year/\">the Irish landscapes</a>; <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ohphille/film/leap-year/\">Matthew Goode’s hair</a>; the fact that you could <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/anyajennette/film/leap-year/\">watch it ‘a million times’</a> and still feel good; the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/geej/film/leap-year/\">Virgo-Sagittarius energy</a>; that it withstands <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/asiyah/film/leap-year/\">all the clichés</a>; <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/katebusbey/film/leap-year/\">Declan staring at Anna in the hotel lobby</a>; and that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rickthesloth/film/leap-year/\">it’s the cutest thing ever</a>.</p><p>All in all, a Goode Film. Happy leap day! <code>#changematthewsmind</code></p><p>(Editor’s note: this <i>Leap Year</i> is not the 2010 <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/leap-year-2010/\"><i>Leap Year</i></a> that won Michael Rowe the Golden Camera award at Cannes.)<br/></p><!--figure[3]-->"

They discussed <i>Portrait</i> preparation, Merlant’s upcoming directorial feature debut, <i>Titanic</i> and John Cassavetes.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><b>What have you made of the passionate reaction that <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> has inspired online?<br/></b><i>Noémie Merlant:</i> We’re so excited, all together, with Céline and Adele, for this love that is shared to us. I think this movie is so important in what it says, what it shows about the world, about new experiences. To realize that people are happy to live this experience, this quite new experience,  because it’s a new vision, it tells so much about the world now, I think, and so it’s great.</p><p><b>Marianne seems to know herself in a way that is hugely inspirational, at least in the beginning. Is that how you saw the character?<br/></b>Yeah. I see myself in a lot of Marianne because at the beginning, she knows what she wants and what she does, but at the same time she does this first portrait, and this portrait is not right. Because it’s a portrait that is kind of stuck in a vision of the male gaze in the society. She [doesn’t] even realize that. She is so grateful to have the chance to be a painter, to not have to be married, so she wants to respect the rules, the ideas, the conventions, as she says.</p><p>And it’s this collaboration with Héloïse and this desire and this love that grows that makes her realize that it’s not her own vision of her art. It’s not the right vision of Héloïse, but it’s even more not the vision of her own art sensibility. And so, the script and Céline’s vision is, for me, what Héloïse is for Marianne: it wakes me up. I’m in a vision of the patriarchal world and I didn’t even notice it. Really, like deeply, concretely, I didn’t even notice it. And this is a movie with—like the second portrait—with a female gaze, a new vision, a new experience that shows really an experience with women.</p><p><b>This film is so quiet, it’s a subtle film, and yet it has an explosive power. Was that a dynamic you were conscious of on set when you were filming?</b><br/>Yeah. It’s like the music: this movie is really silent, there is no music. There’s just two [scenes with] music. And so when there [is] music, it’s even more powerful and even more loud. If there was music all the time in the movie, then you don’t have the same [impact]. And so this movie is all about this, because it takes the time to build. Like, we don’t talk much and [so] when we talk, we really listen to each other. When we smile, we smile because we want to smile, because it’s sincere. We don’t smile because we have to smile, because we’re ladies, no, when we smile, we really smile. And all this slow building of desire and frustration grows the desire, more and more. I think we were really realizing that on set. Yeah. Completely.</p><p><b>What kinds of conversations did you have with Céline before shooting began? Could you describe the nature of your collaboration?<br/></b>The script is so full—everything is there in the script. We didn’t have to talk much, because her vision is clear and I understood it, like everybody [who read] it did. And so while I met her in real life for the audition, and she was watching, like looking at me and reading Héloïse’s lines, then I understood even more that her vision in the movie is her vision in life and how she wants to create the collaboration is the same as in the movie. She was in front of me, she read Héloïse’s lines, and she’s not somewhere looking at me like a director with someone else giving me the lines, no, she is here in front of me. And there was equality, and there was respect.</p><p>And that was the beginning of our relationship. It’s how she builds relationships with everybody on set. And so we didn’t really rehearse before the shooting because there is so many restrictions already. We have to follow the dialogue, the gazes, the breathing, the movement. There is the focus [pulling, which was] really complicated, because there [were] a lot of candles. All the costumes, a lot of restrictions so she doesn’t want us to cerebralize too much and rehearse too much. She wanted us keep something fresh and alive and present. I based my relationship with Héloïse as Adele and I were in parallel.</p><p>At the beginning of the movie, the dresses are tight, we don’t smile, we observe a lot, there is a lot of restriction. And then more and more we build and we start to feel our desire and follow our desire, more and more the movements are large. The smile appears. The eyes are more sparkling, you know, it’s all about details and that’s what we wanted to build on top of the mask that we have at the beginning.</p><p><b>You’ve recently made your directorial debut.<br/></b>I did a short movie [<i>Shakira</i>] that is not out yet, and in December I decided to do what we call a “pirate movie” without production or without looking for money, with my own money. It’s just a couple of friends and [other] people and now I am in post production of this long movie [<i>Mi Lubita</i>]. The short movie is coming out soon I think.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>What was the film that made you want to become an actor?<br/></b>The film that made me want to become a <i>good</i> actor was [<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/john-cassavetes/\">John Cassavetes</a>’] <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/opening-night/\">Opening Night</a></i>. I knew that I wanted to be an actress, but… I realized what an actress is with that movie.</p><p><b>What was the film that made you want to become a director?<br/></b>Cassavetes was one of my big inspirations, but Bergman too, I would say his <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/persona/\">Persona</a></i>.</p><p><b>What’s your go-to comfort movie?<br/></b>A movie I watch when I want to feel better? I would say <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pretty-woman/\">Pretty Woman</a></i> or <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/titanic-1997/\">Titanic</a></i>. It’s sad but I feel better when I see it.</p><p><b>What’s your guilty pleasure movie?<br/></b>It&rsquo;s more a series. I love, <i>Peaky Blinders</i>. And I love <i>Girls</i>. <i>Girls</i> is what I’m up to.</p><p><b>What film poster did you have on your wall when you were a teenager?</b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/titanic-1997/\">Titanic</a>.</i></p><p><b>What’s a film you have fond memories of watching with your parents?</b><br/>It’s a French movie called <i><a href=\"http://Le%20P%C3%A8re%20No%C3%ABl%20est%20une%20ordure\">Le Père Noël est un ordure</a>, w</i>ith Christian Clavier and Josiane Balasko. It’s an old funny movie we watch every Christmas.<br/><br/><b>What filmmaker, living or dead, do you envy, or admire the most?<br/></b>Well there are a lot. Cassavetes is one of them. Céline is one of them. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/agnes-varda/\">Agnès Varda</a> is one of them. Bergman.</p><p><b>Is there a movie that always makes you cry?<br/></b><i>Titanic</i>. Remembering, like, really the first experience in cinema was <i>Titanic</i> for me.</p><p><b>Celine brought up that film when I <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/190778127908/celine-sciamma\">spoke to her</a> as well.<br/></b>Sometimes when we were shooting, you know when Adèle is on the stairs? We were like, “This is our <i>Titanic </i>scene”.</p>"

No, but really. Because what touched me the most is the fact that people will write about films. And that’s the beauty of this digital era. I’m paying a lot of attention about what’s going on around the film, what is being said. I’m really looking at things, so I’ve seen a lot of Letterboxd [reviews]. And I’ve seen that Letterboxd, at some point, used the emoji thing, which was really, really beautiful and fun [Sciamma is referring to the fire and picture frame emoji we added to our Twitter name at the time of the film’s release last year].</p><p> And the fact that people who were touched by the film would take the time to write about it, I think it’s something really beautiful, especially with this film, which is about how love is an education to art. Because art consoles from love, or makes us greater lovers. I find it beautiful that people would express their feelings and put their heart and their mind into cinema. As a young cinephile there was no internet, and I remember writing, just only for myself in little diaries, about film. And so I found it really, really important.</p><p> <b>There’s one question we like to ask every filmmaker we speak to: what is the film that made you want to become a filmmaker?</b><br/>Well, the film that made me understand filmmaking, mise-en-scène, was <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg/\">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a></i>. Jacques Demy, as a director, his films in France, we see them when we are very young; he made <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/donkey-skin/\">Peau d’âne</a></i>, which is a film that is shown to kids. He is such a great director. Definitely as a young kid—I was twelve years old—I found out that, okay, there’s somebody behind this with a vision. Somebody would paint a city like in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-young-girls-of-rochefort/\">Les Demoiselles de Rochefort</a>. </i>Somebody would paint a wall to make it sing the vision of somebody.</p><p>And when discovering mise-en-scène—the fact that there was a director, a vision of somebody—it really blew my mind. I remember I fell in love with the idea of cinema. So, you know, it’s not one film that makes you want to be a director. There are some films that connect you to the idea of cinema and vision and just make you crave for this idea.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p> <b>Before this interview, we asked our community to submit questions for you. </b><b>The first is from Letterboxd member ‘<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sabxdlaire/\">I</a>’, who wants to know if you were inspired by any movie in the process of making </b><b><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire.</i><br/></b>When I’m writing a film, or just even just going with the idea of starting to dream about a film, I don’t watch films anymore, because it’s a very fragile moment. I’m trying to be candid and I’m trying to create this prototype and not to begin being in dialogue with the history of cinema.</p><p>But then when the script is done, and especially when we are talking with the team, with the DP, there are some films that can come up in the discussion. “Okay, we should we should take a look at that,” regarding one specific issue. For instance, with <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>, regarding the lighting, there was this idea, I mean you could definitely look at all the period-piece films and be like, “What about the candles? Are they in the frame? Are there a lot of candles? Are they on chandeliers?  Or are they held?”</p><p> So, I’m thinking about that, this issue of the light in the candles. Night. Day. So me and [cinematographer] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/claire-mathon/\">Claire Mathon</a>, we had that discussion. So Kubrick, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/barry-lyndon/\">Barry Lyndon</a></i>, we watched obviously.</p><p> And also at that moment I’m trying to watch, not specifically films that seem to be related, but films that give me faith in cinema. For instance, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles/\">Jeanne Dielman</a></i><i> </i>by Chantal Akerman, which is such a radical film. I’m trying to get radical positions that have nothing to do with the film, subject-wise, but of people who firmly believed in the language of cinema, and were radical about it. I’m trying to watch radical films that renew your faith in cinema. I mean, they’re major pieces of art, but just give this feeling that you can be radical, you can be bold, and to get this excitement about, really, the language of cinema.</p><p> <b>Many of our members are writing that </b><i><b>Portrait of a Lady on Fire </b></i><b>is the most romantic film ever made, and one of the best expressions of female desire ever put on screen. What’s the most romantic film you’ve ever seen?</b><br/>You know, it’s weird because when I think about it… film is emotional right? A lot of the things that come to my mind are films that are not necessarily pure love stories. This is gonna sound stupid, but <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/et-the-extra-terrestrial/\">E.T.</a>, </i>for instance, is a great love story. This is a great love story for me, and one of the greatest endings in terms of how a relationship ends: <i>E.T.</i> has this idea that the breakup between the two characters is… they want the same thing. And that’s why they’re breaking up, because one is saying “come” and one is saying “stay”, which I think is the most heartbreaking breakup, not being a breakup.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p> <b>I think there might be a new contender for most heartbreaking breakup.<br/></b>The ending of it is really climaxing. Because when we watch love stories, it’s harder, the frozen image of two people leaving in a car, you know, marriage, whatever. Like the romantic-comedy ending where they end up together, then that’s the end. Eternal possession as a promise of fulfilment. Or, it’s the tragic ending, where they will never [be together]. And I really tried to find another way [in <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>], like in <i>E.T</i>. you know, it’s two people saying “I love you” but not being together. It’s a new narrative of love.</p><p>So I’m always trying also to think about forms. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mulholland-drive/\">Mulholland Drive</a> </i>is a film that definitely was also an inspiration, because it’s a film that creates its storytelling around an idea of love. Everybody said: “Oh this film is so hard to get”. [But] it’s really simple. It’s like the first part is a dream of a story that has already happened. And so Lynch created this, screenwriting-wise, he created this idea that those two women, they meet and suddenly they’re in bed together and one says “I think I’m in love with you”, which means that Lynch is telling us that “I love you” is always something you say in the past. And with <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>, I was thinking I have to create a form where “I love you” is something that always has a future. So that’s the kind of dialogue I have with films that inspire me.</p><p>And also <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/titanic-1997/\">Titanic</a></i>. It has kind of the same structure as <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>:<i> </i>the presence of a love story but the memory of a love story. And also, not being together even though there’s a tragic death. It’s a love story about emancipation. And that’s so much what we’re trying to tell: it’s not about whether you end up together, or you don’t. A good love story isn’t about that, it’s about: did it give you emancipation?</p><p> <b>This last question is from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/paulinectar/\">Pauline</a>: “How much do I need to pay you to hire Kristen Stewart—who has just said <i>Portrait</i> was her favorite movie of 2019 and that she has seen all of your movies—in your next project? I’m ready to write the check, just say a number.”<br/></b>Well no, it’s not about the money. But I met Kristen Stewart a few months ago. So I mean, it’s already a start. We talked about cinema, and, and I really enjoyed talking about cinema with her, so…</p>"

When we told him we needed to know why, he replied: “I’d be honored to talk about my love for <i>Avengers Endgame</i>!” Spoilers follow in this Q&amp;A with Max (though at this point if you haven’t seen <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> it’s probably only because Max has watched it for you). This interview was conducted prior to the 2020 Academy Awards.</p><p><b>How many times do you think you have seen <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>?<br/></b><i>Max Joseph:</i> Well, I’ve logged it 26 times as of today. But I also think there are a good three or four watches I didn’t log because I occasionally put it on before bed, and just never logged it. So I’d say my final answer is 29, but that honestly may be lowballing it. I have a feeling that by the time the Oscars roll around, it’ll probably be at 30. I always watch <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4BCcA\">every single film, documentary and short nominated for the Oscars</a>, and thankfully, <i>Endgame</i> was nominated!</p><p><b>What’s your reaction to the news that you are the member who has logged it the most?<br/></b>Kind of shocked! I really didn’t even realize how many times I watched it until you told me! I watch <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> because it brings me happiness, and I love the adventure! When it finally came out on Blu-ray and digital, there were a few times I would watch it multiple times in one day. Then I’d throw something else on, then get upset that I wasn’t watching <i>Avengers</i>. So maybe it isn’t as shocking as I had thought!</p><p><b>What keeps you coming back to it?<br/></b>I love all genres of film. Take this season for example. I love the more meaty and dramatic films like <i>Parasite, 1917, Waves, Queen &amp; Slim</i>. I love comedies like <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> and <i>Booksmart</i>. Animation like <i>Toy Story 4, Frozen II</i> and <i>Klaus</i>. </p><p><i>But</i>, you give me someone flying, turning invisible, super speed… that’s where I live. Superhero movies are just my favorites, and I think the reason I keep coming back to <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is because besides being a superhero movie—which I just naturally gravitate towards—in <i>Endgame</i>, I get a little bit of every genre and mood. I also like that it’s split up into three acts, and each act gives me what I want in a superhero movie:</p><!--figure[2]--><p>Act one is the slow burn, which we never really got in the MCU up to this point. It’s the aftermath of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and them dealing with the implications and the new normal of the universe. And this gives a chance for the story to build, and our actors to show off, especially Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson. It gives something new to the fans of the franchise and is one of the biggest reasons I keep coming back for more.</p><p>Act two is the “time heist” and it is a pure love letter to the fans of the franchise. They revisit some of the best parts of our MCU journey over the last eleven years and mess with it. Is it fan service? Absolutely! But I think they did it right.</p><p>Act three is the final battle at the now-destroyed Avengers headquarters. And this was where the slow burn pays off. It is what we’ve all been waiting for since 2008. The grand finale. The culmination of eleven years and 22 films. We are gifted my favorite battle I’ve ever seen, bone-chilling and heartbreaking moments, as well as the most cathartic endings to the most epic story I’ve ever had the privilege to watch, nearly 30 times over.</p><p><b>What have you noticed with each rewatch?<br/></b>Two things: firstly, how unbelievable the visual effects are. I may be alone in this, but I think Marvel has the best visual effects on the planet. By miles. And rewatching this makes me appreciate how much time and dedication was put into making this. So much happened behind the scenes, that I personally don’t really think about while watching it. But after 26 views, I start to think about green screens, the motion capturing, all of those elements, it’s insane! Go on YouTube and just check out all of that work they did visually. It’s beautiful.</p><!--figure[3]--><p>Secondly, how brilliant Robert Downey Jr. is. I’ve been saying it for years, but RDJ was born to play Tony Stark. Has he had many other brilliant performances throughout his career? Absolutely. But I think that if he was not cast as Iron Man, this franchise wouldn’t have turned out the way it did. He is the heart of the MCU. And he has so many brilliant moments throughout the film, meets his dad during the “time heist”, the realization of “the one”, even the way he interacts with his daughter, Morgan. It’s truly exceptional work. I think it’s his best performance as Stark.</p><p><b>What is the single greatest scene in the film?<br/></b>Oy, well that’s near impossible. A few standouts are Cap wielding Mjölnir, the scene with Tony and his dad, the reveal of Professor Hulk, thicc Thor, Cap vs. Cap, “the snap”. There are so many! But I think the popular answer is also the greatest, and that is when our Avengers return.</p><p>As soon as I heard Sam Wilson’s (Falcon) voice, I lost my mind. And they <i>brilliantly</i> added “On your left” right before all the portals open up. “On your left” is a callback to <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/3r58\">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></i>. That’s the first line of the movie, and is repeated again at the end. Both times are between Sam and Steve, and it was the same in <i>Endgame</i>. And then you add Alan Silvestri’s score (the song is titled ‘Portals’) which is building and building with emotion, which leads into Cap <i>finally</i> saying…</p><p>“Avengers (<i>music cuts</i>) Assemble”… (<i>enter Avengers theme song</i>)</p><p>It. Is. Perfection. I have chills as I type this. It was probably the greatest theater experience I’ve had in my life. I was sobbing. Imagine how I was by the end…</p><p><b>What has the overall <i>Avengers</i> cinematic adventure meant to you?<br/></b>I remember seeing the first <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/28\">Iron Man</a></i> in theaters with some friends in 2008. We all dressed up in suits, because we were at a high school awards show kind of thing, and just went straight to the theater, and we had the best time. From the first moment ’til the end, when Tony says, “I am Iron Man”, then Black Sabbath’s ‘Iron Man’ starts playing, my jaw was on the floor. I gave a standing ovation. In a suit. From that moment on, I knew that this was made for me.</p><!--figure[4]--><p>It has given me the greatest moments in a movie theater, incredible discussions with friends and strangers, and although it may seem cheesy, some much-needed happiness in some of the most difficult times in my life. I watch these stories because I love them. They mean something to me. They are an important part of who I am.</p><p><b>What would you say to people who say that blockbusters like these aren&rsquo;t ‘real’ cinema?<br/></b>Hahaha! This is a hilarious question, and I’m <i>thrilled</i> that you asked it. I’ve actually had a good 20 people ask me this, and I always said that I’d write something or make a video about it, so here we go…</p><p>Let me start off by saying that Martin Scorsese is arguably one of the greatest directors of all time. I love his work, I respect it, and I encourage everyone to watch his full repertoire, ’cause it’s beautiful.</p><p>That being said… ‘real cinema’ is a matter of opinions. To me, <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is just as much real cinema, as <i>The Irishman, Goodfellas</i>, <i>The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather</i>, anything. I don’t care who you are, you can be Martin Scorsese, Kevin Feige, one of my friends, a stranger, I don’t think you have the right to tell me what is ‘real cinema’. You can say something isn’t good, or only being made to earn a profit, but you don’t get to say that movies like this aren’t worthy of being ‘real cinema’. To me, they are. You’re more than entitled to that opinion! I just happen to disagree with you, but you’re not wrong by any means. I’m entitled to my opinion, you’re entitled to yours. And that’s what it comes down to. Opinions.</p><p><b>Thicc Thor—keep or send back to the gym?<br/></b>I totally don’t care. Taika Waititi figured out how to write that character in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/8MHi\">Thor: Ragnarok</a></i>, and thankfully they continued writing him this way in <i>Endgame</i>. So as long as the writers continue on the path that Waititi sent him on, I’m good. Make him thicc, give him an eight-pack, as long as the character has purpose and the lines flow naturally, I’m more than satisfied with whatever he looks like.</p><p><b>How amped are you to learn more about Natasha’s background in this year’s <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/hWV8\">Black Widow</a></i>?<br/></b>Finally! We’ve been waiting since <i>Iron Man 2</i>, and it is finally time for the <i>Black Widow</i> movie she deserves! I’m fascinated by the Red Room, which was where she started her training as a Russian spy. They showed us glimpses of her beginnings in 2015’s <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, and I’ve always been hungry for more information because it looked really interesting.</p><!--figure[5]--><p>I also think that we may finally find out what happened in Budapest. It was first mentioned in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1xFW\">The Avengers</a></i> back in 2012, as a bit of banter between Black Widow and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and has kind of been a mystery ever since. It was actually mentioned again in <i>Endgame</i>. I’m basing this on the San Diego Comic-Con Hall H panel. There was a title card that said “Budapest”, so it would make sense that we’re gonna get what we’ve been asking for!</p><p>I’m also thrilled because the cast is awesome. Obviously double Oscar-nominated actor this season, Scarlett Johansson, Rachel Weisz, David Harbour and one of my favorite actors, Florence Pugh, who had an unbelievable 2019, with <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/fRyO\">Fighting With My Family</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/jhxe\">Midsommar</a></i> (one of my favorite performances of the decade), and she topped it off with an Oscar-nominated performance in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/aSVk\">Little Women</a></i>!</p><p><b>What do you think should win best picture at this year’s Oscars?<br/></b><i>Parasite</i>. And it’s not even close. I think <i>Parasite</i> is one of the greatest films I’ve seen in my life. I think it deserves that number one slot on your Top 250 Narrative Features list.</p><p>It features the best performance from an ensemble, Song Kang-ho should have been nominated for supporting actor (he should be winning). The production design is fabulous. They literally built the Park family’s house <i>for</i> the film! Hong Kyung-pyo’s photography is worthy of being framed. He created a few shots that are permanently engraved in my head (in a good way). And of course, Bong Joon-ho’s direction flows with emotion and his script is original, gripping and electric. He is the definition of a visionary, at the top of his game.</p><p><i>Parasite</i> is the crowning achievement of the decade and should be awarded as such. It would be the perfect way to end the decade with the first foreign-language film (now titled “International Feature Film”) winning Best Picture at the Oscars. #BONGHIVE all the way!</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>What do you <i>think</i> will win?<br/></b>My heart says <i>Parasite</i>, but I think it may end up going to something like <i>Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood</i>, <i>The Irishman</i> or <i>1917</i> (which is in my top ten this year). The easy answer is probably <i>Hollywood</i> because it won the Globe, but that doesn’t always translate into an Oscar.</p><p>But if it’s not <i>Parasite</i>, I think it should be <i>1917</i>. It is a technical work of art from Oscar, Golden Globe and Tony Award-winning director Sam Mendes. Roger Deakins outdid himself and is pretty much guaranteed to earn his second Oscar [update: he did!]. Thomas Newman’s score is probably my favorite of the year (possibly of his career), followed closely by Emile Mosseri’s for <i>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</i> and Hildur Guðnadóttir’s for <i>Joker</i>. And George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman should be on everyone’s radar. They’re phenomenal. It’s shaping up to be quite a race this year!</p><p><b>What’s your favorite thing about Letterboxd?<br/></b>I think the reason I love it so much is because it feels like a family. I’ve had such a passion for the cinema for my whole life, and I like to share it wherever I can. But other social platforms (as wonderful as they are), aren’t always the best place to post about every single movie I’ve watched, or a top ten that I make. Letterboxd is the only place where I can let out all of my opinions, all of my thoughts, without feeling embarrassed or like I’m bothering anyone when I say how perfect <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is. Or if I watch it and spot something new, I can post about it, and have great conversations about what I’ve discovered. It is <i>the</i> place for movie lovers, and it actually helped me love movies more, and to learn more about the crews, studios, and everything behind the film.</p>"

Curious as to why Frances McDormand and William H. Macy were nominated for Lead Actress and Supporting Actor respectively for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aHM\"><i>Fargo</i></a>, he set out to investigate how egregious their category placements were, by comparing their time on screen. Turns out Macy is on screen for 38 seconds longer than McDormand.</p><p>Matthew is our type of completist. Over the past twelve years, he has made it his mission to time all of the Academy Award nominated performances; tracking actors’ seconds on screen (whether seen or heard), keeping track of the time in <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HD0Kp57.jpg\">his notepad</a>, and then summing it all up. He certainly knows more than the Academy, who broadcasted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewAStewart/status/1099860879678541824\">incorrect trivia</a> on last year’s Oscar game that Matthew was quick to put right.</p><p>His motivation is largely to debunk myths, such as the commonly repeated ‘fun fact’ of Anthony Hopkins in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aHW\"><i>The Silence of the Lambs</i></a> having the shortest Best Actor Oscar-winning performance. The shortest, in fact, is David Niven’s appearance in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/VcC\"><i>Separate Tables</i></a>, which is exactly one minute and thirteen seconds shorter than Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter.</p><p>Of course, screen time does not reflect quality by any means. Having a character on screen for longer does not mean the role is better acted or more well-written. In many ways, it can be more impressive when an iconic or powerful character is technically on screen for half an hour or less.</p><p>We spoke to Matthew about his hobby, his opinions on category fraud, and the data he has on this year’s nominees. He shares his results on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewastewart\">Twitter</a>, his <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematthew/\">Letterboxd profile</a> and his website, <a href=\"https://www.screentimecentral.com/\">Screentime Central</a>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>Let’s get to those stats. In Academy Award history, what is the longest performance to be nominated for an Oscar?<br/></b><i>Matthew Stewart:</i> By <a href=\"https://boxd.it/babm\">length</a>, 1940 Best Actress winner Vivien Leigh is seen on screen in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Fq\"><i>Gone with the Wind</i></a> for two hours, 23 minutes and 32 seconds. By <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bacu\">percentage</a>, 1976 Best Actor nominee James Whitmore is on screen in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5mRA\"><i>Give ’em Hell, Harry!</i></a> for 96.52 percent of the film’s runtime.</p><p><b>And the shortest?<br/></b>Both by <a href=\"https://boxd.it/baaS\">length and percentage</a>, 1960 Best Supporting Actress nominee Hermione Baddeley is on screen in<a href=\"https://boxd.it/Vhs\"> <i>Room at the Top</i></a> for only two minutes and 19 seconds, which is just 1.98 percent of the film’s runtime.</p><p><b>You’ve done the math: what was the most egregious category fraud of all-time? And also—the worst failed attempt at category fraud?<br/></b>The most egregious case of category fraud is Richard Burton’s supporting nomination for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3i20\"><i>My Cousin Rachel</i></a>. Others come close, but that is the worst. He’s the main focus of the film and is in 85 percent of it, making it one of the 25 longest performances nominated in any category. And his co-star, Olivia de Havilland, is only in 44 percent of the film, so there’s no explaining it.</p><p>One of the most serious cases of fraud I can think of that didn’t result in a nomination is Jacob Tremblay being campaigned as supporting for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7T0y\"><i>Room</i></a>. It’s a shame that that kind of bias against child actors still exists. And then there are cases where a definitive decision on placement wasn’t made, resulting in no nomination at all, like Lesley Manville in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/T1C\"><i>Another Year</i></a>.</p><p><b>How does your husband feel about your time-consuming hobby?<br/></b>I actually didn’t tell anyone about my hobby for the first four years or so. I wanted to avoid the judgment of people thinking it was odd. </p><p>My husband was interested as soon as I told him and showed him my work up to that point. He’s always been willing to listen to my Oscar-related ramblings, so I shouldn’t have been worried! </p><p><b>Why do you think it’s important to keep such scientific track of category fraud?<br/></b>I think it’s important to because it’s a shameful practice and in order to argue against it, there has to be evidence. And the evidence is stacking up just about every year. I want to provide as much screen-time data as possible as a way to support correct category placements, and of course I hope that someday the Academy will catch on.</p><p><b>Now we have the data, has category fraud gotten worse over the years? Can you tell if the recent absence of Weinstein has helped ease fraud?<br/></b>Category fraud seems to have gotten worse in recent years, with cases like Rooney Mara [in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7DPK\"><i>Carol</i></a>] and Alicia Vikander [winner of Best Supporting Actress for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/9Ohy\"><i>The Danish Girl</i></a>] in 2016 and the cast of <a href=\"https://boxd.it/d2hI\"><i>The Favourite</i></a> last year. But really, it’s not any worse now than it’s been since the introduction of the supporting categories.</p><p>The worst thing about it now is how blatantly greedy some studios are in terms of winning as many Oscars as possible. It’s sad that we’ll never again see two leading actors or actresses nominated for the same film out of fear of them cancelling each other out and neither winning. Campaigning one of them as supporting makes for two potential wins.</p><p>I think Weinstein intensified the trend so long ago that his absence doesn’t change much. Some studios have campaigned that way for so long that I don’t think it will get better any time soon.</p><p><b>Which is the most significant difference between a nominated lead and supporting performance in the same film? [See Matthew’s list: <a href=\"https://boxd.it/bqxS\">Who’s Supporting Who?</a>]<br/></b>The worst case is Timothy Hutton [supporting] over Mary Tyler Moore [leading] in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JTm\"><i>Ordinary People</i></a>. Hutton is onscreen for 32 minutes and eighteen seconds more than Moore! I would personally classify both of those performances as leading, as well as Donald Sutherland’s performance in the same film.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Have you timed which actor or actress has the most Oscar nominated minutes ever? Or, let me rephrase: how many minutes do Meryl Streep’s 21 Oscar nominated performances add up to?<br/></b>Meryl Streep’s <a href=\"https://boxd.it/x9uQ\">Oscar-nominated performances</a> add up to 21 hours, 19 minutes, and 39 seconds, which gives her an average of about 61 minutes per performance.</p><p><b>And the runners up?<br/></b>After Streep, it’s Katharine Hepburn (12:45:10), Jack Nicholson (12:32:27), Bette Davis (12:09:13), and Laurence Olivier (10:54:22).</p><p><b>Which were the hardest and easiest films to time?<br/></b>Naturally, the harder it is to see the actor on screen, the harder it is to time them. So I really despise drawn-out battle scenes or scenes with huge crowds. Timing Charlton Heston’s performance in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29RQ\"><i>Ben-Hur</i></a> during the chariot racing scene wasn’t that hard, because you know where he is, but timing Hugh Griffith’s performance in the same scene was much harder because he’s part of that enormous crowd.</p><p>The easiest one I’ve ever done is James Whitmore in <i>Give ’em Hell, Harry!</i>, since it’s a filmed one-man stage show. <a href=\"https://boxd.it/298c\"><i>Sleuth</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2atK\"><i>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i></a> were easy too, because there are so few actors in the cast.</p><p><b>What results surprised you the most?<br/></b>I remember being shocked to find out that Robert Strauss’s supporting performance in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29Xa\"><i>Stalag 17</i></a> is nineteen minutes longer than William Holden’s leading one. But still, in that case, I don’t have a problem with the category placement. More recently, I was surprised by the shortness of Sam Elliott’s performance in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/aXgc\"><i>A Star Is Born</i></a> [eight minutes, 45 seconds!], and the fact that Scarlett Johansson’s performance in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hJAw\"><i>Marriage Story</i></a> is 20 minutes shorter than Adam Driver’s.</p><p><b>Of those you’ve timed so far, what are the screen times for this year’s nominees?<br/></b>[Actors are ranked below by screen time as a percentage of each film’s total runtime.]</p><p><i>Best Actor in a Leading Role:<br/></i>Joaquin Phoenix (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/h4cS\"><i>Joker</i></a>) – 1:43:44 / 85.3%<br/>Adam Driver (<i>Marriage Story</i>) – 1:25:03 / 62.1%<br/>Jonathan Pryce (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/k8Xk\"><i>The Two Popes</i></a>) – 1:12:42 / 57.7%<br/>Antonio Banderas (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/iOBQ\"><i>Pain and Glory</i></a>) – 59:31 / 52.5%<br/>Leonardo DiCaprio (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/gH0O\"><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i></a>) – 1:01:12 / 37.9%</p><p><i>Best Actress in a Leading Role:<br/></i>Renee Zellweger (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/hH7M\"><i>Judy</i></a>) – 1:27:29 / 74.0%<br/>Cynthia Erivo (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/ijo2\"><i>Harriet</i></a>) – 1:25:12 / 68.2%<br/>Saoirse Ronan (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-2019/\">Little Women</a></i>) – 1:15:01 / 47.7%<br/>Scarlett Johansson (<i>Marriage Story</i>) – 1:05:19 / 47.7%<br/>Charlize Theron (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bombshell-2019/\">Bombshell</a></i>) – 37:16 / 34.3%</p><p><i>Best Actor in a Supporting Role:<br/></i>Anthony Hopkins (<i>The Two Popes</i>) – 55:14 / 43.9%<br/>Brad Pitt (<i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>) – 55:12 / 34.2%<br/>Al Pacino (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/dYOq\"><i>The Irishman</i></a>) – 53:58 / 25.8%<br/>Tom Hanks (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood/\">A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</a></i>) – 44:56 / 41.4%<br/>Joe Pesci (<i>The Irishman</i>) – 43:22 / 20.7%</p><p><i>Best Actress in a Supporting Role:<br/>Florence Pugh (<i>Little Women</i>) – 42:06 / 31.2%<br/>Margot Robbie (<i>Bombshell</i>) – 26:16 / 24.2%<br/>Kathy Bates (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/richard-jewell/\">Richard Jewell</a></i>) – 25:06 / 19.2%<br/></i>Laura Dern (<i>Marriage Story</i>) – 18:36 / 13.6%<br/>Scarlett Johansson (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Jojo Rabbit</a></i>) – 15:36 / 14.4%</p><p><b>It looks like the more time on screen, the better the chances of a win, judging by some of the frontrunners this year. Is that an identifiable trend in your data?<br/></b>Looking at the data from the last ten years, Oscar wins do tend to favor longer performances across all categories. The shortest Best Actor or Actress nominee of the year has only won once since 2010—Olivia Colman last year for <i>The Favourite</i>.</p><p>The average winning leading performance since 2010 is 75 minutes long (63 percent of screen time), with none under 50 minutes (when the previous decade had eight under 50, and five under 40 percent). The average winning supporting performance since 2010 is 36 minutes long (28 percent of screen time), with only one under 20 minutes (which was Allison Janney in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/dzR0\"><i>I, Tonya</i></a>).</p><p><b>Have you noticed any fun stats for this year’s nominees?<br/></b>The only screen-time-related stat I’ve noticed is that this year’s Supporting Actor nominees have either the highest or second-highest average length of all time in the category. I can’t say for sure until after I time Tom Hanks, nominated for <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>.</p><p>With an average age of 71.6, this year’s Supporting Actor Oscar nominees are the oldest group ever nominated in any acting category. This is the fourth time this decade that the Supporting Actors have broken the long-standing record of 61.3 held by the 1965 Supporting Actress group.</p><p>Also, all of this year’s acting nominees make up the second-oldest group ever nominated, with an average age of 51.8. The record is still 53.1 for 2017—the third time the record was broken this decade after previously being held by (again) the 1965 group (49.3).</p><p>So far, this year’s nominees haven’t broken any records. Phoenix’s performance could be the overall longest Oscar-winning performance of the decade, but that’s about it.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What nominees in the past decade broke <a href=\"https://www.screentimecentral.com/longest-performances\">records</a>?<br/></b>I think one thing worth mentioning is that Mahershala Ali just broke the record for longest Supporting Actor winning performance last year [for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/hErk\"><i>Green Book</i></a>], previously held by Christoph Waltz in 2013 [for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2cCk\"><i>Django Unchained</i></a>], who took the record from Timothy Hutton.</p><p>And the female percentage record was broken twice this decade after being held since 1991 by Meryl Streep [for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1ACc\"><i>Postcards from the Edge</i></a>]; by Marion Cotillard in 2015 [for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/6A58\"><i>Two Days, One Night</i></a>] and then by Charlotte Rampling in 2016 [for <a href=\"https://boxd.it/9ZPG\"><i>45 Years</i></a>].</p><p>Three of the ten longest Best Supporting Actress-nominated performances of all time (by minutes) are from 2016 (Mara, Vikander, Leigh). Mara and Vikander also make the percentage top ten, along with Hailee Steinfeld (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/Sog\"><i>True Grit</i></a>), Emma Stone (<i>The Favourite</i>) and Julia Roberts (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/4OhI\"><i>August: Osage County</i></a>)—so exactly half of that top ten are from this decade alone.</p><p>2019 was the first time ever that two performances under ten minutes were nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the same year—Sam Elliott, and Sam Rockwell in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/fcFY\"><i>Vice</i></a>.</p><p><b>And what about performances you timed from 2019 that were snubbed? (More from other years are <a href=\"https://www.screentimecentral.com/beyond-the-oscars\">here</a>.)</b></p><p>Awkwafina (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/kIky\"><i>The Farewell</i></a>) – 1:00:19 / 60.4%<br/>Zhao Shuzhen (<i>The Farewell</i>) – 37:33 / 37.6%<br/>Constance Wu (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/jIBM\"><i>Hustlers</i></a>) – 1:02:31/ 56.8%<br/>Jennifer Lopez (<i>Hustlers</i>) – 53:09 / 48.3%<br/>Robert De Niro (<i>The Irishman</i>) – 2:14:19 / 64.1%<br/>Lupita Nyong’o (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/gnV6\"><i>Us</i></a>) – 57:21 / 49.3%<br/>Robert Pattinson (<a href=\"https://boxd.it/icFU\"><i>The Lighthouse</i></a>) – 1:23:18 / 76.4%<br/>Willem Dafoe (<i>The Lighthouse</i>) – 56:02 / 51.4%<br/>Margot Robbie (<i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>) – 17:00 / 10.5%</p><p><b>You’ve watched more nominees than most people (let’s face it, maybe all people). Forgetting screen time, what are the most underrated nominated performances you think people should check out?<br/></b>Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3iVO\"><i>The Guardsman</i></a> (I can’t separate them, sorry!), Mickey Rooney in <a href=\"https://boxd.it/5Mcy\"><i>The Bold and the Brave</i></a>, and Norma Shearer in <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/Tr6\">Marie Antoinette</a>.</i></p><p><b>How about greatest snubs. Who are you dying to see get nominated for an Oscar?<br/></b>When I think of who the Academy has snubbed the most, I immediately think of John Goodman. He’s everyone’s go-to answer, but it’s true. After him, I’d say Emily Blunt, Steve Buscemi and Alfred Molina.</p><p><b>What Oscar win are you rooting for the most on Sunday?<br/></b>My favorite Oscar-nominated performance of the year is Joaquin Phoenix in <i>Joker</i>. I know the film is polarizing, but he’s undeniable, and I hope he wins. As for upsets in below-the-line categories, I’d love it if <i>The Lighthouse</i> won Best Cinematography, and it’d be so cool if <i>Parasite</i> won Best Film Editing.</p>"

Nice. The number also represents the highest amount ever paid for a film at Sundance (by 69 cents), showing that the people with the check-books clearly have a lot of faith in this one. They’re now <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/02/hulu-neon-paid-22-million-palm-springs-streamers-dominated-sundance-film-festival-1202850004/\">saying</a><b> </b><b></b>the distribution deal, with Hulu and Neon, is worth even more.</p><p>Talk was kind for the movie around Park City, with audiences responding warmly to its contemporary take on a familiar sci-fi movie setup, one the filmmakers have attempted in vain to keep secret, as most reviews can’t help but call it a modern riff on <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/groundhog-day/\">Groundhog Day</a></i>. As <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/edge-of-tomorrow/\"><i>Edge of Tomorrow</i> </a>proved, it can be a fertile starting point.</p><p>“A thoughtful and hysterical romantic comedy,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nextbestpicture/film/palm-springs-2020/\">writes</a> Letterboxd member Matt Neglia in his review. “Contemplates the meaning and meaningless of life with humor and a fun sci-fi concept. It’s <i>Groundhog Day</i> for a new generation. Reminded me of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind/\">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> </i>at times, in all the best ways.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/boys-state/\">Boys State</a><br/></b></i><i>Directed by Jesse Moss and Amanda McBain / Winner, US Grand Jury Prize: Documentary</i></p><p>Many of the high-profile docs that premiered this year at Sundance (miniseries <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mcmillions/\">McMillion$</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hillary/\">Hillary</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/miss-americana/\">Miss Americana</a></i>) arrived at the festival with imminent predetermined premiere dates on TV or streaming (HBO, Hulu and Netflix, respectively), but few were talking about <i>Boys State </i>ahead of time. Now everybody is talking about it, especially since Apple and A24 teamed up to acquire the film for the record-breaking (for a documentary) sum of $12 million. The film chronicles a project in Texas where 1,000 teenage boys are tasked with building a representative government from the ground up.</p><p>“One of my absolute favorites out of Sundance 2020,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tasharobinson/film/boys-state/\">writes</a> Tasha Robinson in her review on Letterboxd. “A riveting look inside one year’s Boys State, an annual, state-by-state civics project where seventeen-year-old boys create their own government from scratch. The filmmakers focus on a few kids who emerge as key leadership players, giving speeches and crafting policy, but the event turns surprisingly quickly into a nail-biting fight that underlines all of the problems with America’s current political environment.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shirley-2020/\"><b>Shirley</b></a><b><br/></b></i><i>Directed by Josephine Decker</i></p><p>Elisabeth Moss delivers another stunning performance as iconic horror novelist Shirley Jackson in this chamber drama (based on a 2014 novel by Susan Scarf Merrell) that presents a fictional scenario in which the agoraphobic Jackson and her professor husband “welcome” a young couple (played by Logan Lerman and Odessa Young) into their home, and proceed to both torment and bond with them. Moss’s awesomely messy turn here will surely figure prominently in next year’s awards conversation, and Young more than holds her own in a film teeming with tension.</p><p>Letterboxd member Dilara <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dilaraclem/film/shirley-2020/\">writes</a> that “Elisabeth Moss going sapphic madness erotica is everything I wanted from 2020”. Hulburd <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hulburd/film/shirley-2020/\">observes</a>: “Moss/Stuhlbarg/Young a trifecta not to be fucked with.”</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/kajillionaire/\">Kajillionaire</a><br/></b></i><i>Written and directed by Miranda July</i></p><p>All three of indie darling Miranda July’s films have premiered at Sundance. Her newest, <i>Kajillionaire,</i> follows a family of inept con-artists—played by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger and Evan Rachel Wood—as they contend with a new addition (Gina Rodriguez) to their odd little tribe.</p><p>As in July’s previous work, the plot isn’t as important as the utterly specific tone, but unlike her previous two films, this is the first one she hasn’t also starred in. July <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/190562923853/sundance-2020\">told</a> Letterboxd at the film’s premiere that she no longer has to get in front of the camera to set that tone, as the cast knows what she’s aiming for from her other works.</p><p>“Lonely, awkward Evan Rachel Wood warms my heart,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/caseyleeclark/film/kajillionaire/\">writes</a> Casey Lee Clark on Letterboxd. “Awkwardly funny, as is July’s MO, but I truly did not expect this to be quite so tender. I guess 2020 really is going to be the year of the lesbian,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mediarulesfilm/film/kajillionaire/\">says</a> Josh.  </p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-40-year-old-version/\">The 40-Year-Old Version</a><br/></b></i><i>Written and directed by Radha Blank</i></p><p>Blank, a producer on the TV version of <i>She’s Gotta Have It</i>, writes, directs and stars in this reportedly autobiographically inspired tale of a once-promising playwright who never quite fulfilled her potential. Facing the prospect of irrelevance, Radha turns to rapping, and finds self-affirmation in the art form.</p><p>“Frisky, messy and funny as hell, Blank’s film is its own best evidence for an artist to take full control of their creative life,” is Letterboxd member Scott Renshaw’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/scottrenshaw/film/the-40-year-old-version/\">assessment</a>. “This feels like a true Sundance film. Truly independent, and truly special,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/orlispierer/film/the-40-year-old-version/\">writes</a> Orli Spierier.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/promising-young-woman/\">Promising Young Woman</a><br/></b></i><i>Written and directed by Emerald Fennell</i></p><p> This one certainly had the crowds at Park City talking, with equal amounts of shock and celebration peppering the conversations. Carey Mulligan stars as a… well, it’s in the title… who trawls bars pretending to be drunk, luring opportunistic rapists to their doom. All the talk bodes well for the film’s April release by Focus Features.  </p><p>On Letterboxd, Erik Nordgren <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/enniomorricone/film/promising-young-woman/\">called</a> it “absolutely fucking devastating. Carey Mulligan is *chef’s kiss* and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time”. Another Letterboxd writer, Marinermc, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/marinermc/film/promising-young-woman/\">previewed</a> the potential discourse that will accompany the film’s wider release: “Cue incel rage; cue cis white dudes pooping their pampers; cue me not giving a shit and loving this movie.”</p><p><!--figure[7]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/zola/\">Zola</a><br/></b>Co-written and directed by Janicza Bravo</i></p><p>The subject of much pre-festival hype, <i>Zola</i> may not have been exactly what we were expecting. But then, considering it’s the first movie based on <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/WDwyW\">a Twitter thread</a>: what <i>were</i> we expecting? What we get: wild shenanigans, a day-glo aesthetic, copious amounts of full-frontal male nudity and an insane “blaccent” from co-star Riley Keough. The plot concerns two recently acquainted strippers who head down to Tampa for the weekend, ostensibly to make money from pole dancing, where things escalate.</p><p>“Searing critique of whiteness in America through the lens of Twitter melodrama,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/irathethird/film/zola/\">writes</a> newly minted Letterboxd member IraTheThird (podcaster and TV writer Ira Madison III). “A wild fucking ride. I loved every minute of it. Colman fucking Domingo, man,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/elainemays/film/zola/\">offers</a> Sydney Lou Who.</p><p><!--figure[8]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-night-house/\">The Night House</a><br/></b></i><i>Directed by David Bruckner</i></p><p>Bruckner’s follow-up to his well-regarded Netflix horror <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-ritual-2017/\">The Ritual</a></i>, which deserved a bigger audience, is one of the more commercial offerings on this list, and is a great example of how much fun it can be to see genre movies at a festival when you know nothing about them. It also received attention for garnering a $12-million distribution deal with Searchlight Pictures.<br/></p><p>Rebecca Hall is pretty darn great as a recently widowed woman living in a beautiful but apparently haunted lakeside house built by her dead husband.</p><p>“Good fucking horror movie!” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cnnrfly/film/the-night-house/\">exclaims </a>Letterboxd member Cnnrfly. “Really solid in its direction and build of tension. This felt like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/personal-shopper/\">Personal Shopper</a> </i>mixed with <i>House of Leaves</i> and a dash of Haruki Murakami thrown in for good measure.”</p><p><!--figure[9]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/never-rarely-sometimes-always/\">Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always</a><br/></b></i><i>Written and directed by Eliza Hittman</i></p><p><a></a>This drama generated many comparisons to the 2008 Best Foreign Language Oscar-winner <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days/\">4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</a>. </i>Like that Romanian film, it follows two young women attempting to procure an abortion. In this case, it’s two teenagers from rural Pennsylvania who have to travel to New York.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/laurenmendoza/\">Lauren Mendoza</a> writes in her five-star Letterboxd review of the film: “Eliza is brilliant and this movie is so tangible and visceral and I think all men need to watch it because it gives a glimpse into what it means to exist in a young female body and that is powerful thank you bye.”</p><p><!--figure[10]--></p><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/minari/\"><b>Minari</b></a><b><br/></b></i><i>Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung / Winner, US Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic</i></p><p>Coming out of Sundance with a staggering 4.2 average Letterboxd rating—not to mention the festival’s top prize—Lee Isaac Chung’s film has been embraced by everyone who sees it. Set in the 1980s, it concerns a Korean-American family attempting to adjust to life in rural Arkansas after moving there from the West Coast. Rising star Steven Yuen (from Letterboxd fave <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/burning-2018/\">Burning</a></i>) and young actor Alan S. Kim are both getting raves playing father and son.</p><p>IndieWire critic David Ehrlich was effusive in his <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/minari/\">praise</a> on Letterboxd: “Told with the rugged tenderness of a Flannery O’Connor novel but aptly named for a resilient Korean herb that can grow wherever it’s planted, Lee Isaac Chung’s semi-autobiographical <i>Minari</i> is a raw and vividly remembered story of two simultaneous assimilations; it’s the story of a family assimilating into a country, but also the story of a man assimilating into his family.”</p><p>Evan <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/evanajuria/film/minari/\">forsees</a> big things for the film, writing: “I’m not saying this is the best movie at Sundance just because it won the best dramatic film award. It is a truly amazing film and has a very good chance of [becoming a] Best Picture nominee. I have yet to comprehend everything that has happened but all I can say is god damn.”</p><p>Or perhaps Alynna best summed up the response to the film when she <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/alyanna/film/minari/\">wrote</a>: “Oh you’re telling me A24 just blessed me with another tender Asian-American immigrant family drama about cute grandmas? Bonus: this one stars a ridiculously adorable Asian baby boy (Alan Kim in the best child performance I’ve ever seen!) and Steven Yeun in a tank top! We <i>love</i> to see it.”</p>"

It concerns two exotic dancers: King herself—who goes by Zola—(played by Taylour Paige) and her new friend Stefani (Riley Keough), who head down to Tampa one weekend accompanied by Stefani’s boyfriend Derrek (played by Cousin Greg himself, Nicholas Braun) and Stefani’s “roommate” (read: pimp, played by Colman Domingo). To say shit gets cray doesn’t quite cover it.</p><p>It’s been simplistically, if understandably, described ahead of time as “<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pulp-fiction/\">Pulp Fiction</a> </i>meets <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/spring-breakers/\">Spring Breakers</a></i>”, but Bravo herself cited a much more eclectic selection of cinematic inspirations when we spoke to her ahead of the film’s world premiere.</p><p>“My inspirations were <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wiz/\">The Wiz</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/coffy/\">Coffy</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/paris-is-burning/\">Paris Is Burning</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-killing-of-a-chinese-bookie/\">The Killing of a Chinese Bookie</a></i>, <i>Special Victims Unit</i>. And <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/natural-born-killers/\">Natural Born Killers</a></i>!”</p><p>Bravo (pictured above) took to King’s Twitter thread immediately when it went viral. “I think I found it within a day, or days, of it coming out,” says Bravo. “It was sent to me by a group of girlfriends and before finishing it I knew that I wanted it, and I worked at getting [the rights] for about two years.”</p><p>Bravo wasn’t the only one who wanted to tell this story on the big screen—James Franco was initially linked to an adaptation.</p><p>“It’s not that it was difficult to get the rights, it’s that there were many other people who wanted it and the people who got it before me were just fancier. But here we are.”</p><p>Bravo is credited with <i>Zola</i>&rsquo;s script alongside playwright Jeremy O. Harris, who recently blew up Broadway with his incendiary show <i>Slave Play. </i>She concedes there were unique challenges in translating something so specific to the big screen.</p><p>“The thing that everyone was attracted to about this story was the voice, and I would say the hardest thing was to make sure the voice was still present in the film. What you’re reading, that it would translate into the visual.”</p><p>Bravo says she’s not sure if this is going to lead to a rash of social network-based films (<i>Letterboxd: The Movie</i> excepted of course), “but I would say that what the story tells you is that there are more ways to access great storytelling than the ones we’ve been used to.”</p><!--figure[2]--><h2><i>Spree</i></h2><p><b>“Put it on lists and do those Letterboxd battles!”</b></p><p>It can be all too easy to over-perceive mini-trends at film festivals, but it was hard to overlook the large role that social media played in multiple films at Sundance this year.</p><p>In Eugene Kotlyarenko’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/spree-2020/\">Spree</a></i>, floppy-haired <i>Stranger Things</i> star Joe Keery (pictured above) plays wannabe influencer Kurt Kunkle, a driver for a Los Angeles-based ride-sharing service (called… Spree) who plots to up his subscriber numbers by murdering his more obnoxious passengers on a live stream. Or he might just be staging it all for the LOLs. The entire film plays out as a series of live-streaming videos, mostly from the dashboard cameras in Kurt’s car.</p><p>Kotlyarenko’s film questions the overly prominent role of social media in modern life. “We&rsquo;ve all kind of signed on to this thing, to use the literal expression,” he told us. “It’s part of the way we understand ourselves and our relationship with the rest of the world. It’s basically: a like or repost or a good rating on something, gives us part of our validation or sense of self and that is a kind of twisted place to be. [<i>Spree</i>] is a provocation, it’s a challenge, it’s a way of saying: look, we have a problem.”</p><p>Kotlyarenko had a number of inspirations in mind while he was writing and directing <i>Spree</i>. “A lot! A lot of movies! I actually put ten movies in a Dropbox for the cast and crew. One movie that I thought was really inspiring was Jafar Panafi’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/taxi-2015/\">Taxi</a></i>, also known as <i>Taxi Tehran</i>. You want <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/man-bites-dog/\">Man Bites Dog</a> </i>in there, because the whole thing is that the movie’s a live stream, right? So how do you do that pseudo-doc thing but <i>now</i>? So you’re following a psychotic character and you’re getting very close to them. Uncomfortably close. What else? <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/network/\">Network</a> </i>and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/to-die-for/\">To Die For</a></i>, just hardcore media satires. There’s a bunch of other films, like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/coming-apart/\">Coming Apart</a></i>, do you know this film? It’s a late ’60s movie starring Rip Torn, where he’s a psychiatrist and he sets up these hidden cameras and exploits all his patients and stuff but they don’t know that they’re on camera.”</p><p>It turns out Kotlyarenko is a keen Letterboxd member, and he’s looking forward to other members generating an average rating for his film. “Dude, I hope this gets over 3.5!”</p><p>We can safely assume Kotlyarenko won’t employ measures as drastic as those adopted by the main character in his movie in order to get his desired rating.</p><p>“I want people on Letterboxd to watch the film and rate it whatever the fuck you think it is [worth]. And, you know, put it on lists and do those Letterboxd battles. Put it up against, you know, some Gasper Noé movie. And let it win!”</p><!--figure[3]--><h2><i>Kajillionaire</i></h2><p><b>“Instead of sort of half-arseing two jobs, you’re doing one job really well.”</b></p><p>Filmmaker, actor and performance artist Miranda July is a central figure in the American independent cinema scene, even though she’s only directed two films: <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/me-and-you-and-everyone-we-know/\">Me and You and Everyone We Know</a> </i>and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-future/\">The Future</a>. </i>Her third full-length feature <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/kajillionaire/\">Kajillionaire</a></i> had its world premiere at Sundance this year, just as her previous works did, but the big difference this time around is that she stuck to writing and directing, having also played the lead role in her two previous films.</p><p>“It’s just better,” she told Letterboxd of staying behind the camera for <i>Kajillionaire</i>. “Instead of sort of half-arseing two jobs, you’re doing one job really well, you know? You get a lot of energy when you’re performing—that’s nice. Especially initially to kind of set the tone, that was super helpful, starting out. But now it’s like: these people all knew my work. So I didn’t have to actually be in it for them to like, get it. Which is, you know, what a dream right?”</p><p><i>Kajillionaire</i> is a typically (for July) offbeat tale of a Los Angeles family who attempt low-level scams to raise money to pay the rent on the disused office space with oozing walls in which they live. The family (comprised of mom Debra Winger, dad Richard Jenkins and daughter Evan Rachel Wood) find their equilibrium challenged when an optimistic young woman (Gina Rodriguez) eagerly joins them for their latest “heist”.</p><!--figure[4]--><p>Letterboxd asked July if she thinks there’s a common narrative thread running through all three of her films.</p><p>“I mean, I see the thread, but it’s really just me living my life. Not that it’s autobiographical at all. But now I was ready to face issues and tell a story that only could be told by someone who had been a child, grown into an adult, and then been a parent of a child and had this 360-degree perspective. And also I think there’s a joyfulness that only comes in once you’re like: I know a little bit how to do this, you know? Like, maybe there’s some fun that I had, as well as breaking my heart 100 times.”</p><p>Although <i>Kajillionaire </i>would seem to speak to general economic anxiety, July said that wasn’t necessarily the point of the film.</p><p>“All I’ll say about that right now is: I wrote it in this time and the whole thing comes from my unconscious. But I am the child of boomers and, you know, living in the same world you’re living in. The sense that something criminal might have happened is in the air, but I wasn’t consciously [thinking]: ‘I’m going to hit them hard with this political satire’. It’s not that movie. But I don’t think anyone would be wrong to find that in it.”</p><!--figure[5]--><h2><i>Beast Beast</i></h2><p><b>“It allows you to circumvent all of the bullshit that is Hollywood.”</b></p><p>We met up with one of our favorite filmmakers (and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jimmycthatsme/\">Letterboxd member</a>), Jim Cummings, who wrote, directed and starred in the 2018 low-key masterpiece <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thunder-road-2018/\">Thunder Road</a></i>, an expansion of a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thunder-road-2016/\">13-minute short</a> that won the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2016.</p><p>Cummings was at the 2020 festival as both an executive producer and supporting cast member in a film in the NEXT program (which highlights emerging filmmakers) called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/beast-beast/\">Beast Beast</a></i>. It’s the first feature from writer/director Danny Madden.</p><p>“Danny was my co-producer and creative director on many of my short films, the <i>Thunder Road </i>feature, and my new upcoming werewolf movie. So it’s great to be here for his first Sundance feature.”</p><p>Cummings, who also runs <a href=\"https://shorttofeature.com/\">The Short to Feature Lab</a><b> </b>in Malibu, understands more than most how shorts can be a pathway to feature filmmaking.  </p><p>“It’s just so much more fulfilling to make something as a proven concept. You kind of become your own studio in a way that’s incredibly fulfilling. I think it’s the future. You can afford to make something over a weekend with your friends in the backyard that’s a short film and then you can use that and use Kickstarter or a crowd-equity plan campaign to raise the rest of the money for a feature. It’s absolutely the future and it allows you to circumvent all of the bullshit that is Hollywood.”</p><!--figure[6]--><p>Hang on, did you say new upcoming werewolf film? <i>Thunder Road</i> fans can look forward to beholding Cumming’ follow-up feature soon.</p><p>“I shot a werewolf movie in Coalville, Utah last March. I spent four months out here. I wrote it, I directed in and I star in it, and it’s a proper monster movie. It’s like a proper werewolf comedy. It’s like <i>Thunder Road </i>with a werewolf. Or <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/zodiac/\">Zodiac</a> </i>as a comedy. That’s coming out in theaters in September.” </p><p>And because this is Jim Cummings we’re talking to, there’s more: “I ran a crowd-equity campaign for a movie that we made about talent agents that I can’t really talk too much about, but it’s very good and it’s a horror movie that we shot in November. That should be coming out around the same time.”</p><!--figure[7]--><h2><i>Possessor<b> </b></i></h2><p><b>“It has a lot to do with character psychology, without giving too much away.”</b></p><p>Following the world premiere of his new film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/possessor/\">Possessor</a>, </i>Letterboxd sat down with second-generation filmmaker Brandon Cronenberg, the son of legendary director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/david-cronenberg/\">David</a>. The younger Cronenberg’s second feature (following 2012’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/antiviral/\">Antiviral</a></i>) had Sundance audiences audibly wincing at the extreme body horror on display in the sci-fi thriller, which stars Andrea Riseborough as an assassin who forcibly inhabits the minds of others to perform her incredibly violent executions.</p><p>We asked Cronenberg how he feels about the term “body horror” (a sub-genre often associated with his father’s work) being applied to his film.<br/></p><p>“I guess it depends how you define body horror,” says Cronenberg. “There are violent scenes in the film and I guess that fits into a certain aspect of body horror, but it isn’t really what I would necessarily describe as body horror. There’s a small amount of story stuff that I feel is legitimately a part of that genre, but it’s not [the] prime aspect of the story.”</p><p>Cronenberg confirmed that on-screen viscerality appeals to him in general as a filmmaker: “I think especially in genre, although it can be incredibly conceptual. It’s partly defined by deep visceral emotions, not always because of graphic violence or gore. Sometimes it can be a film primarily about dread or anxiety that I would still consider to be a horror film, and a lot of classic ghost films for instance are not graphic but are visceral and in that emotional sense.”</p><!--figure[8]--><p>The violence in <i>Possessor </i>may have had audience members covering their eyes in Park City, but Cronenberg told us there was a point to all the grue.</p><p>“It wasn’t just there to be intense or to provoke people. It has a lot to do with character psychology, without giving too much away. The way it’s depicted and the various approaches that are taken in different scenes, very much relate to the main character, her relationship with violence, her own internal space and also where the audience is situated from a kind of more objective or more subjective position.”</p>"

One of the important reasons I had no limitations was because while I was filming, I never expected to stay alive.” —Waad al-Kateab, director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/for-sama/\"><i>For Sama</i></a>, newly minted Oscar nominee and Letterboxd’s highest-rated documentary of 2019.",
      "abstract": "<p>In an awards season where the Academy Awards’ Best Director nominees are all male, it’s in the Documentary Feature category that you’ll find the women, on four out of the five nominated films: Julia Reichert (a director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-factory/\"><i>American Factory</i></a>), Petra Costa (director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-edge-of-democracy/\"><i>The Edge of Democracy</i></a>), Tamara Kotevska (co-director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/honeyland-2019/\"><i>Honeyland</i></a>), and Waad al-Kateab, one half of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/for-sama/\"><i>For Sama</i></a>’s directing team. (The final nominee is Feras Fayad’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cave-2019/\">The Cave</a></i>, notably produced by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/kirstine-barfod/\">Kirstine Barfod</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/sigrid-jonsson-dyekjr/\">Sigrid Jonsson Dyekjær</a>.)</p><p><i>For Sama</i> began as a record of the tragedies that so many don’t see, and turned into an essential, enormous archive of footage taking the documentary world by storm this awards season. There have been, and will be, many other documentaries about Syria, but what makes <i>For Sama</i> unique is its female eye behind the camera.</p><p>Looking forward to a future as a new mother and young wife to the love of her life, Hamza, Waad al-Kateab was never afforded the freedom to simply savor young motherhood. From age 21 she filmed the horrors and small joys of every-day life in rebel-held Aleppo covering five years of political uprising. This included the taxing day-to-day work of her doctor husband and their friends in the small hospital they ran on courage and donations.</p><p>That Waad made it out of Syria with her 500 hours of footage is no small miracle. Having gained refuge in London, she partnered with Emmy-award winning director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/edward-watts-2/\">Edward Watts</a> to shape the film. We see her grow as a storyteller and become more courageous in her focus, zooming closer into wounds and keeping the camera rolling, even when those on screen are drawing their very last breaths. </p><p><i>For Sama </i>has made waves around the world since premiering at SXSW in 2019. It’s an overwhelming experience; fearless filmmaking that captures the immense and urgent extremities of human joy and suffering. David Ehrlich <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/for-sama/\">called the film</a> a “bracingly horrific yet resiliently beautiful documentary”. Graham Williamson <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/gdw/film/for-sama/\">noted</a> that “beauty, in <i>For Sama</i>, is a reminder of humanity, a reminder that people still live and give birth and play and laugh and fall in love in these places, as well as just die”. Many other Letterboxd members could only quote al-Kateab’s poetic narration directly, to describe their intense emotional responses to the film: </p><p><blockquote></p><p>“My first baby, Sama. Her name is meaning ‘the sky’. Sky we love, sky we want. Without air forces. Without bombing. Sky with sun, with clouds.

      "body": "<p>In an awards season where the Academy Awards’ Best Director nominees are all male, it’s in the Documentary Feature category that you’ll find the women, on four out of the five nominated films: Julia Reichert (a director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-factory/\"><i>American Factory</i></a>), Petra Costa (director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-edge-of-democracy/\"><i>The Edge of Democracy</i></a>), Tamara Kotevska (co-director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/honeyland-2019/\"><i>Honeyland</i></a>), and Waad al-Kateab, one half of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/for-sama/\"><i>For Sama</i></a>’s directing team. (The final nominee is Feras Fayad’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cave-2019/\">The Cave</a></i>, notably produced by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/kirstine-barfod/\">Kirstine Barfod</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/sigrid-jonsson-dyekjr/\">Sigrid Jonsson Dyekjær</a>.)</p><p><i>For Sama</i> began as a record of the tragedies that so many don’t see, and turned into an essential, enormous archive of footage taking the documentary world by storm this awards season. There have been, and will be, many other documentaries about Syria, but what makes <i>For Sama</i> unique is its female eye behind the camera.</p><p>Looking forward to a future as a new mother and young wife to the love of her life, Hamza, Waad al-Kateab was never afforded the freedom to simply savor young motherhood. From age 21 she filmed the horrors and small joys of every-day life in rebel-held Aleppo covering five years of political uprising. This included the taxing day-to-day work of her doctor husband and their friends in the small hospital they ran on courage and donations.</p><p>That Waad made it out of Syria with her 500 hours of footage is no small miracle. Having gained refuge in London, she partnered with Emmy-award winning director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/edward-watts-2/\">Edward Watts</a> to shape the film. We see her grow as a storyteller and become more courageous in her focus, zooming closer into wounds and keeping the camera rolling, even when those on screen are drawing their very last breaths. </p><p><i>For Sama </i>has made waves around the world since premiering at SXSW in 2019. It’s an overwhelming experience; fearless filmmaking that captures the immense and urgent extremities of human joy and suffering. David Ehrlich <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/for-sama/\">called the film</a> a “bracingly horrific yet resiliently beautiful documentary”. Graham Williamson <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/gdw/film/for-sama/\">noted</a> that “beauty, in <i>For Sama</i>, is a reminder of humanity, a reminder that people still live and give birth and play and laugh and fall in love in these places, as well as just die”. Many other Letterboxd members could only quote al-Kateab’s poetic narration directly, to describe their intense emotional responses to the film: </p><p><blockquote></p><p>“My first baby, Sama. Her name is meaning ‘the sky’. Sky we love, sky we want. Without air forces. Without bombing. Sky with sun, with clouds. With birds.”  </p><p></blockquote></p><p>This is what the filmmaker says of her daughter, epitomizing the hope that was never lost, that allowed her to be where she is today. Waad and Edward spoke to Letterboxd correspondent <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/\">Ella Kemp</a> just as our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/2019/\">2019 Year in Review</a> went live, with their film topping the documentary list.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b><i>For Sama</i> is the <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4ndvu\">highest-rated documentary of 2019</a> on Letterboxd. It’s also the highest rated feature-length documentary of the 2010s, and is in our top ten documentaries of all-time. How does that make you feel?<br/></b><i>Edward Watts</i>: That’s incredible.</p><p><i>Waad al-Kateab</i>: To know that and to see that the film isn’t just doing well as a Syrian mission but in the film industry, it really means a lot to us.</p><p><i>EW</i>: And to know that it’s reaching so many people is such good news. The dream was always that the film would reach many people and they would come in contact with this incredible story.</p><p><b>How did the film come together from over 500 hours of footage?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: I worked with Ed for two years to shape the film’s story, to decide what we wanted to keep and take out. We were open to trying everything. We had really amazing editors who were also so flexible with us and would let us try anything.</p><p><i>EW</i>: It was about the meeting of our two perspectives as well. Obviously Waad had lived the experience, she was the insider. It was her story and in so many ways it was her people’s story, and I was coming to it from the point of view of an audience, of an outsider, albeit one that cared passionately about Syria and what happened there. The beginning part of the process was understanding our two perspectives and what was important to both of them, where they met in the middle. It was like sculpting, gradually working down this huge, extraordinary and powerful archive, and the shape of the film gradually taking form.</p><p><b>Ed, you’ve praised Waad’s footage for capturing “the full spectrum of humanity”. How did you find that balance in the final cut?<br/></b><i>EW</i>: That was one of the reasons it took two years—it was a very complicated process to find that balance. In a lot of our earlier versions we didn’t have that balance. When it was told chronologically, you started in a place of light and hope, those positive emotions of the early days of the revolution. But then it was kind of a straight line down into the darkness and you ended with this long section during the siege and all of the hardship that involved. </p><p>It was too much, the audiences we showed early on became overwhelmed by the darkness at the end. It was a real journey. Because that wasn’t the truth of the experience, that was clear from the footage but also from Waad and Hamza themselves. The truth of the experience was that full spectrum of human emotion, so it was about finding the best way to reflect that by always thinking to ourselves, we’ve just had something really horrific, how do we bring it to the light? How do we keep it moving so that we never get stuck in one emotional place? When we changed the chronological structure to move around in time, that helped hugely.</p><p><b>Waad, in this film you’re omnipresent as a filmmaker, a citizen journalist, a mother, a wife. How do you see these roles informing each other?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: They were all mixed together while working on the film and living in those circumstances. In one second it was most important to be the journalist and the filmmaker, focusing on how I should shoot something, but then it would always still be so important to keep my awareness as a mother to protect my child and keep hope all the time. Sometimes you feel as a mum that you can’t leave, that you can’t film and abandon the one-year-old child—but this is what life was in those circumstances, it’s all mixed. I was just trying to live everything as much as I could to give it the right work and effort.</p><p><b>The finished product frames women’s domesticity in an urgent way. There’s war, there’s violence, there’s men fighting, but there’s also all the women behind and alongside it.<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: In all the films and reports from Syria, we’ve never felt like our voice is heard. Even if there are female characters in movies, no one has their own voice in that loud way. There are layers of feeling happening very deeply to reflect the truest experience. We’ve never seen films like this. When I was doing the film I was focusing on how I can reflect the experience exactly, one that can speak to everything I love, everything I hate, everything I was scared about, to be honest with all the women and mothers who lived through that, who can see themselves in my shoes and see what I’ve done for Sama and for my work as well.</p><p><b>You film so viscerally, always going further, rather than choosing when to censor or cut away. Were there ever lines you felt you couldn’t cross?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: I think I crossed a lot of lines. One of the important reasons I had no limitations was because while I was filming, I never expected to stay alive. In everything I was doing, I thought, I could be dead tomorrow. So I kept filming, going deeply through all the fears we were living. It allowed me to be okay with everything, because I’m not a foreign journalist coming to film other people’s suffering. I’m living through that, and I know exactly what it means. I think that’s why if I were to make the film now and I knew I would survive, there might be many things I wouldn’t have filmed in that way.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>When did you decide on the perspective of the narration, in addressing the film to Sama, Waad’s daughter?<br/></b><i>EW</i>: The idea didn’t come until we were two thirds of the way through the whole process of crafting the film. When you’re living with this material for so long, suddenly you can hear it in a different way and suddenly it begins to speak to you. It was a moment of epiphany where we tuned into that essence of the film, not only in the way that Waad and Hamza had lived was for Sama, but the way Waad had shot the footage had a conversation going on with Sama, even before Sama was born, in the way Waad filmed her pregnancy. It was just one of those moments where we found the key that unlocked everything, and everything fell into place. Hamza is a very stoical person, but we called him up when we had this idea and Waad explained, and he started crying. That’s how we knew it was a good idea.</p><p><i>WaK</i>: By linking everything to Sama, it becomes about not just Sama as my daughter but also as an idea of the future in general, hope, everything we were fighting for. Sama was one simple example of why the struggle existed. Everyone around me felt they could name the film for their own kids too. It really touched everyone who went through that experience in different ways. Everyone who has kids, everyone who dreams of having kids, even those who don’t want to bring kids into this world but have a stake in the future and are fighting for something for themselves, or for their country, or for their life.</p><p><b>You’ve said before that films can’t change the world. What do you hope for the legacy of <i>For Sama</i>?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: Films can’t change the world but people can. People who could be engaged in the film and really want to do something. That’s why we didn’t stop at making <i>For Sama</i> a film—that’s why we launched our impact campaign, <a href=\"https://www.actionforsama.com/\">Action For Sama</a>. We ask people to react to what’s happening right now in Syria, to the bombing of hospitals and civilians, to make a movement.</p><p><i>EW</i>: I had this great conversation, admittedly with one of those people you find in Los Angeles full of wacky ideas. I said, “films can’t change the world,” and he said, “man, what are you talking about! Your film is changing the soul of mankind!”. It was a bit much, but there’s something about this film that has connected people with what happened in Syria in such a visceral, emotional and personal way.</p><p>I wonder whether maybe it is part of the change that’s happening, that hopefully people will start seeing how connected we all are and that one day we might not live in a world where crimes are committed with impunity in the Middle East or elsewhere and we wring our hands and say that there’s nothing we can do. I really hope that this film is part of this sense that in order to solve the world’s problems and to stand up against these crimes and these tyrants, we all need to work together.</p><p><b>What film first made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b><i>EW</i>: My parents were never together, and I only saw my dad once a month. He was a huge film lover, that was the thing that he chose us to bond over. He showed me <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/yellow-submarine/\">Yellow Submarine</a></i>, that trippy Beatles film. I got obsessed with the flying glove. And then he showed me a film called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/seance-on-a-wet-afternoon/\"><i>Séance on a Wet Afternoon</i></a>, and I watched that when I was eight and didn’t know what the hell was going on. There was something about his passion for film that I drank in at a very early age.</p><p><i>WaK</i>: I really don’t know the answer and have never thought about it. Even when I started filming, I’d never really thought I would be in this position as a director. What really makes me want to make films is the fact that we had such a lack of media and freedom in our country. Because we felt that there was nothing allowed to us, not to watch, not to do. Everything was totally under their control. That’s why I felt that I wanted to do something we couldn’t really hear or see before, which is why <i>For Sama</i> came to be.</p><p><b>What do you think of the specific strength of documentary as a form?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: I didn’t really watch many other things in the past. I’ve been watching documentaries here, one of the things I watched and really loved was <i>American Factory</i>. The other one was <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-great-hack/\">The Great Hack</a></i>. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-biggest-little-farm/\">The Biggest Little Farm</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/one-child-nation/\">One Child Nation</a></i>. Most of the people who are with us in this category! The only thing I knew about documentary was my point of view. When I watch these other movies, I admire all these people and love their films, and enjoy how you can see the world through different points of view.</p><p><i>EW</i>: This is the great age for documentary. I’ve been making docs for over ten years. I think documentary is the right form for these crazy days we’re living through. These days of great turbulence, when the history of humanity is at such a critical juncture. I think documentaries in their reality, in their ability to tell us so much about who we really are, and these amazing people who are around the world, living extraordinary lives and showing the best of courage and humanity and difficult circumstances, I think that’s why they’re resonating more and more. Because sadly the world is more and more troubled.</p><p>One of the earliest documentaries that I loved was <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/burma-vj-reporting-from-a-closed-country/\">Burma VJ: Reporting from a Closed Country</a></i>—it was just an example of a country I’d never been to, a story that was so hard to tell, and yet, similar to this, it was told through the footage of the people who had actually lived through it. It’s such an extraordinary story of hope, and human beings’ desire for freedom, and then the violence of dictators that crashed that. Nothing like a documentary can capture that emotion when you’re dealing with events of such magnitude.</p><p><b>Which Syrian filmmakers and films should Letterboxd members seek out?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: There’s a filmmaker called Ossama Mohammed, he has a film called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/silvered-water/\">Silvered Water</a></i>. There’s also <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/omar-amiralay/\">Omar Amiralay</a>, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ziad-kalthoum/\">Ziad Kalthoum</a>, who did <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/taste-of-cement/\"><i>Taste of Cement</i></a>. There are so many about people who maybe you haven’t heard of, but who really created cinema for Syria, who were trying to work in very hard circumstances while everything was happening.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On the red carpet in Cannes you held up a sign: “Stop bombing hospitals”. What do you feel about your role at these kinds of events across awards season?<br/></b><i>WaK</i>: I see myself as a Syrian woman who believes in this cause, and that’s why I made the film. I really believe that any filmmaker has a cause in their life and that’s why they’re really doing a lot things, out of passion. On every platform we can reach with <i>For Sama</i>, it really needs to be about Syria, and for Syria, and for the people, for this experience which I can’t just move on from.</p><p>That’s why we held the signs, that’s why in everything we are trying to do now, it’s always about how we can shed light on what’s happening. I hope we can continue to do that. We don’t do films for nothing. We want to be useful as much as we can, to be the voice for our own people and doing more for the future.</p>"

For the final Showdown of 2019—and the decade—we asked you to list <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/uncut-gems/\">your favorite ‘uncut gems’</a> of the 2010s—the overlooked, under-seen, not-loved-enough movies that you think more people need to know about.</p><p>It’s been the most popular Showdown ever, with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/uncut-gems/\">pages and pages and pages of lists</a> worth exploring in their entirety. We added up the most-mentioned films, removed those that had been watched by more than 15,000 members (per the specific rules of this challenge) and arrived at a final top 20, with Alex Ross Perry’s messy rock drama <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/her-smell/\"><i>Her Smell</i></a> taking the top spot (<a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/178686472328/nyff-56\">read our write-up about the Elisabeth Moss-starring film here</a>). It’s quite an international list, with six women directors (Josephine Decker, Agnieszka Smoczyńska, Kelly Reichhardt, Hélène Cattet, Cristina Gallego and Mélanie Laurent), two Ciro Guerra films from Colombia, and a film from the Safdie brothers, the directors behind <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/uncut-gems/\"><i>Uncut Gems</i></a>, which has an impressive 4.3 average on Letterboxd right now.</p><p><!--figure[2]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-250-narrative-features/\">The Top 250 Narrative Feature Films of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p><i>Parasite</i>, <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> and <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> topped the highest-rated 250 narrative feature films of the 2010s. The busiest directors on this list were Denis Villeneuve and Taika Waititi, with five films each. Hirokazu Kore-eda, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Wes Anderson, Quentin Tarantino and Lee Chang-dong all feature with three films each.</p><p><!--figure[3]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-directors/\">The Top 100 Directors of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p>We set out to find the narrative feature film directors whose work in the 2010s, as ranked by the Letterboxd community, combined with their overall placing on our Top 250 of the 2010s list, signified their excellence in the directing field. After some data-heavy research, backed by a solid methodology, one name emerged at the top: Denis Villeneuve. Taika Waititi and Lee Chang-dong round out the top three.</p><p>Interestingly, only two Best Director Oscar winners from the 2010s made the list: Damien Chazelle and Alejandro González Iñárritu. The most prolific directors on the list are Hong Sang-soo (14 films) and Sion Sono (11 films).</p><p><!--figure[4]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-most-popular-films/\">The 100 Most Popular Films of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p>This list is determined by the films that have the most activity across our community, including watches, reviews, comments, list additions and more. <i>Get Out</i> topped this list, with <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>La La Land</i> close behind.</p><p>This is a heavily US-based list, with very few films made outside the US and only two made primarily in non-English languages: <i>Parasite</i> and <i>Roma</i>. Christopher Nolan is tied for first place with the Russo brothers in terms of having the highest number of films on the list, at four each.</p><p><!--figure[5]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-most-obsessively-rewatched-films/\">The Top 50 Most Obsessively Rewatched Films of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p>By “obsessive” we mean total watches from all members who logged a film five or more times. The top three are: <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>La La Land</i>. The Marvel Cinematic Universe accounts for a full 20 percent of the list (including the <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> films and <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i>, but not including <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i>). The <i>Star Wars</i> franchise has six films on the list.</p><p>The Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, are the MVPs of this list, with four MCU directing credits. Jon Favreau is represented all over the list as a director (<i>Elf</i>), a writer and a producer. And, of course, the late Stan Lee is credited across the MCU. We made an accompanying list for those who have <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-most-obsessively-rewatched-paddington/\"><i>Paddington</i></a> obsessions.</p><p><!--figure[6]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-documentary-non-fiction-films/\">The Top 100 Documentary &amp; Non-Fiction Films of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p><i>O.J.: Made in America</i> is the top non-fiction title of the 2010s, while <i>For Sama</i> is the top feature-length documentary. The MVP of documentary directors is American great Frederick Wiseman, who has three films in the list. Joshua Oppenheimer, Agnès Varda, Steve James, Adam Curtis, Asif Kapadia, Petra Costa and the filmmaking duo Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin all have two films apiece. 24 women directors feature in the list, across 26 films.</p><p><!--figure[7]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-international-films/\">The Top 100 International Films of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p>An incredibly strong list, this was topped—of course—by <i>Parasite</i>, with <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> and <i>The Handmaiden</i> completing the top three. There were some notable exclusions on this list, due to not having a US release date until 2020. They are: <i>Bacurau</i>, <i>System Crasher</i>, <i>And Then We Danced</i>, <i>Vitalina Varela</i> and <i>Two Blue Stripes</i>. Maybe we’ll see them in our 2020 round-up.</p><p><!--figure[8]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-animated-films/\">The Top 100 Animated Feature Films of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p>This is a Japan-heavy list, with more than 35 films in the top 100. The US follows with 26 films, including the first-placed <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i>. Don Hertzfeldt’s <i>It’s Such a Beautiful Day</i> is at number two and Lee Unkrich’s <i>Coco</i> takes third place.</p><p><!--figure[9]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-women-directed-feature-films/\">The Top 100 Women-Directed Feature Films of the 2010s</a><b> </b></h2></p><p>A truly international cross-section of feature films is represented in this list, which is topped by Céline Sciamma’s <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>, one of three by the director to appear in the list. Greta Gerwig has an impressive two films in the top ten. Other directors to appear twice are: Kathryn Bigelow, Dee Rees, Lynne Ramsey, Marielle Heller, Andrea Arnold, Maren Ade, Juliana Rojas, Zoya Akhtar, Meghna Gulzar, Nadine Labaki, Kelly Reichhardt and Naoko Ogigami. More recent films feature heavily, with 22 from 2017 versus just one from 2013.</p><p><!--figure[10]--><h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-2010s-top-directorial-debuts/\">The Top 50 Directorial Debuts of the 2010s</a></h2></p><p>We looked for the highest-rated feature film debuts by directors who had not helmed a film solo prior. We included directing partnerships where part of the collaborative team had not made a feature before; that’s why Peter Ramsey is in the mix alongside feature newcomers Rodney Rothman and Bob Persichetti, taking the top spot for <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i>.

Abrams. “While it was never quite an ‘indie’ on the set of this movie, we needed to keep the thing feeling as human as possible, and not like a massive machine.” Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron) agrees: “The way we approached shooting a lot of these scenes, there was a looseness to it. There were things shot in big, beautiful, choreographed takes that are just astounding to watch.”</p><p><b>2. It’s all good when you have the right people.<br/></b>“We didn&rsquo;t know at the beginning of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/\">The Force Awakens</a> </i>exactly what it would look like with Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac and John Boyega,” says Abrams. “What would that cast be like? On the first day of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/\">Rise of Skywalker</a>, </i>we knew those things were working. What we didn’t know was everything else. The scale of the movie is pretty enormous, [but] none of that would matter if you didn’t care deeply and track with the people. So the most important thing—people—we were good with. We knew we had this incredible cast, who I think have gone beyond people’s expectations and are extremely spectacular in the film.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>3. Isaac and Boyega fail, again, to quell the Poe and Finn-shipping frenzy.<br/></b><i>“</i>When Oscar first came in, the chemistry was blatant,” John Boyega (Finn) reminisces. “There was a natural vibe between me and Oscar. I don’t know why. I just liked the guy.” Oscar Isaac elaborates in, er, more detail. “He came into my dressing room, he was so sweet. He was like, ‘You wanna run the scene before?’ and I’m like ‘Yeah!’ In the dressing room we were like butt-to-butt and ran the scene together and from then on we’ve been in that position.”</p><p><b>4. Rian Johnson’s <i>Last Jedi</i> set things up nicely for <i>Skywalker</i>.<br/></b><i>“</i>Larry Kasdan and I, and Michelle Rejwan and Kathy [Kennedy], the producers, we had talked about quite a few things back [on <i>The Force Awakens</i>], so it was a bit of picking up where we had left off,” Abrams explains of <i>Rise of Skywalker’s </i>storyline. “What Rian Johnson had done in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-the-last-jedi/\">The Last Jedi</a> </i>had set up some things that were wonderful for the story. One of the things being that the cast was separated. The characters weren’t together for the entire movie, essentially, so this was the first time this group got to be together.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Getting together with co-writer Chris Terrio to pick up the threads, Abrams says, “we immediately wanted to tell a story of an adventure, there were some very specific things that we were both drawn to immediately. We just started doing that thing that you do, which is you say: ‘what do you desperately want to see? What feels right?’”</p><p><b>5. Keri Russell freaked J.J. Abrams out.<br/></b>New cast member Keri Russell, who plays the mysterious bad-ass Zorii Bliss, kept her mask on between takes. “J.J. emailed me and said: ‘Do you wanna be in <i>Star Wars</i>?’, and I was like, ‘Yeah!’ Then he told me the idea about the mask. Personally I loved the mask. That’s my fantasy: that I can see everyone, in a super-tough version of myself in costume, and nobody can see me. That’s my dream. It’s a real power play. Because no one can really see what you’re thinking, and you can see everyone else.”</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>The problem was, says Abrams, “Keri loved the mask so much that the first two days she worked as Zorii, the entire two days, I never saw her face. She could have, like most people, taken the mask off between takes. Or after a couple of hours. Or after two whole days! I got to work with Keri for a couple of days and never saw her. It was weird.”</p><p><b>6. There are horses in space. Space horses.<br/></b>Fellow new addition Naomi Ackie, who plays mysterious freedom fighter Jannah, found her character through Jannah’s physicality. “I felt like Jannah’s strength was in her body, so when I got to training, that’s when I was like, ‘I’ve got this’, being able to do pull-ups and horse riding, and with that came the confidence that I hadn’t previously experienced.” (Those space horses have a name: <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Orbak\">orbaks</a>.)</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>7. Richard E. Grant broke the review embargo and was not sued (yet).<br/></b>Third major new cast addition Richard E. Grant, who plays Allegiant General Pryde, feared he was in deep trouble for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardEGrant/status/1202114990209032192\">tweeting his reaction</a> to the movie after a cast screening the night before this press event. “I thought that Disney would sue me, because I think you’re not supposed to say anything about it. But I didn’t tweet any spoilers,” he promised, before going on to review the film some more.</p><p><!--tweet[1]--></p><p>“Having seen the first one when I was a theater student when I was twenty years old, before many of this cast were even born, it’s an extraordinarily emotional thing to see just the passing of time that goes through all of these movies. It felt really like a combination of everything I’d read in the Bible, Greek mythology, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wizard-of-oz-1939/\">The Wizard of Oz</a></i> all rolled into one. It delivers an emotional wallop at the end that I was totally unprepared for. I was wiped out and I barely slept. So thank you very much for having me.”</p><p><b>8. Carrie Fisher is <i>everywhere</i>.</b><br/>“I, like everyone who knew her, loved Carrie,” says Abrams. “The idea of continuing the story without Leia wasn’t a possibility, and there was no way we were gonna do a digital Leia. There was no way we would ever re-cast it. But we couldn’t do it without her. And when we went back to look at the scenes that we hadn’t used in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, what we realized is we had an opportunity and we could use that footage, use the lines that she was saying, use literally the lighting, the… [at this moment a stage light suddenly and unexpectedly turns off] …that was amazing. That was creepy. Hi Carrie. That’s so Carrie, by the way, to do that. Weird.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p>“In any event,” Abrams continues, “we knew we had an opportunity to use the footage to create scenes that Leia could be in. And of course, had Carrie been around—and it’s still impossible for me to believe she isn’t, because we’ve been editing with her for about a year, and she’s been very much alive with us in every scene—if we’d had Carrie around, would we have done some different things here and there? Of course we would have. But we had an opportunity to have Carrie in the movie, and working with all the actors, including <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/billie-lourd/\">Billie Lourd</a>, her daughter, who’s in scenes with her, we were able to do something that Carrie herself, I’d like to think, would be happy with. She’s great in the movie, of course. And it’s still emotional and moving to think of her and how sad we all are that she’s not sitting here with us.”<br/></p><p><b>9. <i>Everyone</i> is emotional.<br/></b>Daisy Ridley found the emotional demands of playing Rey more trying than the physical burden. “With the physical stuff, you train and train and train… obviously the stamina needs to be there for you to continue to do the thing. But I would say it was more demanding emotionally, because there really wasn’t a day where I was like, ‘Oh, it’s just a quick scene’. Coming from the last one, which was quite heavy, even the joyous scenes I found very strange to do. That was probably the most tricky thing, to sustain that emotion. There’s a singular intention that was tiring.”</p><p><!--figure[7]--></p><p>Likewise, Oscar Isaac found his character’s optimism tested. “He’s always had a bit of wild-card energy in figuring out where he fits in the story, and I remember J.J. getting excited about dirtying up the squeaky flyboy image that he’s had for a bit and just revealing a bit more of his personality. [We see] the hope that I think he in particular brings, a kind of relentless, almost aggressive optimism that he has. And how that is tested. And how he tries to push them all even when it seems quite hopeless.”</p><p><b>10. John Boyega has no time for shit-talking.<br/></b><i>“</i>I really do genuinely respect J.J. because he’s not into bullshit,” Boyega says. “When you come into this industry the way I did, you get a whole bunch of promises. A whole bunch of people telling you, ‘this is gonna happen and that’s gonna happen’. J.J. was like: ‘I really liked you in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/attack-the-block/\">Attack the Block</a> </i>and we’re gonna get you in something’, and in my head I was like, ‘I’ll see you in twenty years mate, champion’. But I auditioned at [Abrams’ production company] Bad Robot several times before <i>Star Wars</i>. For TV shows and other stuff. And it just so happens that <i>Star Wars </i>was what I was right for. I appreciate him not being like the rest of this industry, talking shit half the time.”</p><p><!--figure[8]--></p>"

Nelson is a member of the Kwakwaka’wakw First Nation (Kingcome Inlet, Quatsino).<br/></p><p>With cinematographer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/norm-li/\">Norm Li</a> (who filmed <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/beyond-the-black-rainbow/\">Beyond the Black Rainbow</a></i>) shooting in real time over a series of extra-long takes on Super 16mm, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-body-remembers-when-the-world-broke-open/\">The Body Remembers…</a> </i>is designed to appear mostly as a single-take film. The supposedly hidden cuts are “impossible to spot”, writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lilfilm/film/the-body-remembers-when-the-world-broke-open/\">Sean Baker</a>. “This is absolutely not ‘just a gimmick’,” agrees <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/naomikawasevevo/film/the-body-remembers-when-the-world-broke-open/\">Olivier Lemay</a>. “The feature-length shot worked wonders at taking us on this real-time journey with the characters that became uncomfortably immersive.” The result is a grounded and intimate portrait of two unique members of a group vastly under-represented in cinema. “It feels based deeply in character and never exploitative,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/millygribben/film/the-body-remembers-when-the-world-broke-open/\">Milly Gribben</a>.</p><p>Sitting down with Tailfeathers (who goes by ‘Máijá’) and her co-writer and co-director Kathleen Hepburn, we wanted to know more about their filmmaking technique, and the films that have inspired them.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>What was the impetus for telling this story?</b><br/><i>Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers:</i> The film is inspired by an experience that I had in East Vancouver, where the film takes place. Like in the film, I encountered a young woman who had just fled her abusive partner and she was literally standing barefoot in the rain and was very pregnant. I spent a few hours with her and it was a transformative experience. Sometimes we are lucky enough to have these encounters with strangers that fundamentally alter us. I carried that experience with me for a number of years wondering what to do with it, wanting to honor her story, and just kind of was left with the question of what happened to her because I never saw her again. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to turn it into a feature film and honor her experience and our experience and what happened in that short time we’d spent together.</p><p>Most of my experience with directing has been through documentary, and then my experience with narrative film has been through acting. Knowing that I wanted to make a feature in real time, having never made a narrative feature before, I figured it would be a good opportunity to collaborate with someone with more experience. And the way that I learned as a filmmaker has always been through collaboration. Kathleen has been a friend for a number of years and I so deeply admire her work and just her as a person. Her feature debut <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/never-steady-never-still-2017/\">Never Steady, Never Still</a></i>, it’s a phenomenal film. I reached out to Kathleen and proposed the idea of co-writing and co-directing and doing this together and that’s how it happened.<br/><br/><b>Kathleen, how did you respond to </b><b>Máijá’s proposal?</b><br/><i>Kathleen Hepburn:</i> It was a very immediate response. She told me what had happened in the real life experience. It just felt like such an important, rich story, very complex and also artistically quite challenging to tell a real-time story. We decided to do it in one continuous take. It felt like a really wonderful honor to be a part of this project and an amazing challenge that I was really excited to participate in.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>This film is putting characters on screen that haven’t seen a lot of representation. Was that part of the motivation?</b><br/><i>E-MT:</i> Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the two women you see in the film are so familiar to me as an Indigenous woman. I know these women, so in so many ways they’re by no means unconventional. They’re just very real people who exist who, like you said, haven’t been represented on screen very often.</p><p>In terms of Indigenous cinema and Indigenous representation, there’s this long history of misrepresentation and people who aren’t Indigenous telling our stories and getting it fundamentally wrong. This was an opportunity to explore a very simple story that embodies all of these larger themes in such a nuanced way. It was an opportunity to speak about issues of class and various forms of privilege that exist within the Indigenous community based on lived experience. It was also an opportunity to, yeah, explore these larger systems of oppression that impact Indigenous in very different ways on a daily basis in Canada. There’s so much richness to both of these characters and so many opportunities to explore these larger themes through their lived experience on screen.</p><p><b>Although this breaks a lot of new ground, were there cinematic precedents that you had in mind?</b><br/><i>KH:</i><b> </b>One film we looked at in the writing process was <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/frozen-river/\">Frozen River</a></i>. In terms of style and tone, we were also looking at Andrea Arnold, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fish-tank/\">Fish Tank</a></i>. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wendy-and-lucy/\">Wendy and Lucy</a></i>, Kelly Reichardt’s film. But in terms of representation…</p><p><i>E-MT:</i> I think <i>Frozen River </i>kind of set a precedent in terms of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/misty-upham/\">Misty Upham</a>. She’s also Blackfoot. I’m a Blackfoot. She passed away very tragically, but seeing a woman like her on screen in a film that American audiences gravitated towards was pretty transcendent. Knowing that a character like that could hold space on screen in a way that drew American audiences in, I think kind of set maybe a bit of a precedent for this. Because we wanted Rosie’s character to be raw and real and vulnerable. When we found Violet Nelson, she embodied all of that and we wanted to present the world with a complicated individual who you would believe the world has not been kind to. Violet was all those things and she just delivered such an incredible performance and she was kind of like the light of our film. She carried so much of the film.</p><p><b>What precedents did you have in mind when you were thinking about shooting these long, real-time takes?</b><br/><i>E-MT: </i>There were a lot of things to consider. One thing I think that was obviously most important for the process was supporting Violet’s performance, and coming from an acting background I really appreciate the rehearsal process, especially with theater. You get to sit with the work and be with it for weeks before you go to the stage. There’s a really incredible momentum that builds and being able to do the performance from beginning to end in one go on stage.</p><p>And there’s kind of this palpable energy that builds also with the audience because it’s an experience you’re all having. We wanted to bring that energy and that process into the film. We rehearsed for four weeks, and also rehearsed with our crew for five days and carefully choreographed everything. Our cinematographer, Norm Li, and the rest of our crew, were all just fully on board for this wildly experimental challenge.</p><p><i>KH:</i> I mean, obviously we were inspired by films like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/victoria-2015/\">Victoria</a></i>, but I think for us, we didn’t want it to be about the one-take, so we were actually kind of hesitant to speak about it before we released the film because it wasn’t a gimmick. It was more to give the audience the same emotional experience as the actors.</p><p><b>We’d like to ask you about your life in film. What movie made you want to become a filmmaker?</b><br/><i>E-MT:</i> I think for me it was Alanis Obomsawin’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/kanehsatake-270-years-of-resistance/\">Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance</a></i>. It’s kind of her most seminal work. She’s the grandmother of Indigenous cinema in Canada and also kind of around the world. She’s Abenaki, she’s 85 years old and she’s still making films. She just had a film at TIFF. She’s made over 50 films. <i>Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance</i> is about the Oka crisis that happened in the early ’90s in Canada. It’s one of the most important works of cinema in Canada, and just knowing that an Indigenous woman made that film, that still is so incredibly important. I think that was the one that kind of motivated me to make movies.</p><p><i>KH:</i> I think <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/in-the-mood-for-love/\"><i>In the Mood for Love</i></a> was probably the film where I was actually like, “Oh, okay, this is what filmmaking is like and can be like”.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><i> </i></p><p><b>What’s your go to comfort movie?</b><br/><i>E-MT:</i> I could watch <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moonlight-2016/\">Moonlight</a></i><i> </i><i></i>over and over and over and over again. I don’t know if it’s a comfort movie, but there’s just something so splendid and beautiful about that experience and I actually crave watching that film. I probably watch it once a month. I’ll just sit down and watch a section of it.<i><br/></i></p><p><i>KH: </i>This is a more recent film, but one that I just loved so much is <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/toni-erdmann/\">Toni Erdmann</a></i>. Just everything about it is so inspiring. It’s hilarious and heartbreaking. But I don’t watch it once a month.</p><p><b>What movie, or movie scene, makes you cry the hardest?</b><br/><i>KH: </i>Oh, I know this one. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/my-girl/\">My Girl</a></i>. When Macaulay Culkin dies, the funeral scene. “He needs his glasses. He needs his glasses.”<i><i><br/></i></i></p><p><i><i>E-MT:</i> </i>God, that’s going to make me cry.</p><p><b>As a teenager, what movie, or movie character did you feel closest to?</b><br/><i>E-MT: </i>For sure, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/now-and-then/\">Now and Then</a></i>. That was something I connected with, but that’s when it was twelve years old or something.</p><p><i>KH:</i> I was a tomboy growing up, so there was an Elijah Wood film called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-war/\"><i>The</i> <i>War</i></a>. For some reason, that one always stuck with me. I don’t know. I wanted to be those little boys, I think.</p><p><i><i>E-MT: </i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/edward-scissorhands/\">  Edward Scissorhands</a></i>. I so connected with Edward. It’s just such a wild, bizarre, beautiful story of this outsider, but no, I’m not a fan of Johnny Depp now.</p><p><b>What film do you have fond memories of watching with your parents?</b><br/><i>E-MT:</i> Oh man. Growing up we didn’t have a lot of money, but something that my parents always did was take us to the cinema and my dad, especially. On the weekends we would go and see double bills, sometimes not paying for the second movie. My dad was such an action movie guy. I grew up going to action movies with my dad. I remember, actually, my mom is the biggest Jackie Chan fan. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rumble-in-the-bronx/\">Rumble in the Bronx</a></i>, I think, holds a special place in my heart. It’s set in the Bronx, obviously, but it’s shot in Vancouver.</p><p>Then there was this Canadian TV show called <i>North of 60</i>, which was set in the north in Canada in this Indigenous community. It was kind of this show that we tuned into every week. I would say <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/tina-keeper/\">Tina Keeper</a>, she’s an actress and also she’s a producer now, but she played a cop, an Indigenous woman. For me as a young person seeing her on screen was pretty transformative because she was an Indigenous woman who held a position of power and was a real person and was complex and beautiful and not framed within this overwhelming trauma that you often see Indigenous people framed within. That was pretty important just for me as in terms of representation, and then also for our family, we just tuned in every weekend. I don’t know if it’s even a good show. I can hear the theme song in my head. It was a CBC show.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>What filmmaker, living or dead, do you envy or admire the most?</b><br/><i>E-MT:</i> Right now, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/tasha-hubbard/\">Tasha Hubbard</a>. She’s a Cree filmmaker from Saskatchewan and she made a documentary film called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nipawistamasowin-we-will-stand-up/\">n<i></i></a><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nipawistamasowin-we-will-stand-up/\">î</a></i>pawistamâsowin: We Will Stand Up</i>. It was about the murder of Colten Boushie, a young Cree man who was murdered by a white farmer named Gerald Stanley. Gerald walked away from all charges and is a free man, and the film is winning all sorts of awards across Canada and it’s so brave.</p><p>Tasha grew up with a white family, she was adopted. She grew up in this white farming community and she’s an Indigenous person who has experienced both of those realities. Racism on the prairies in Canada is very prevalent and in-your-face and violent. As a person who comes from the prairies—and I have an intimate knowledge of that reality—just the courage that Tasha took to make that film and to fully invest herself in such a challenging process. Yeah, there’s no words to sort of describe the respect that I have for her and what she’s done.</p><p><b>If you were forced to remake any classic, which one would you choose?</b><br/><i>E-MT:</i> Well, this isn’t a classic, but one film that I’ve watched recently that just blew my mind is <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/happy-as-lazzaro/\">Happy as Lazzaro</a></i>, the Italian film. It has such a high level of understanding about the world and the complexities of society, but it’s also just this beautiful film that tricks you into coming to an understanding that you don’t realize you’re having as you go through the film. I don’t have that sort of mind that can handle that kind of structural complexity.</p>"

He marvels at how <i>Knives Out</i> stays one step ahead of what we expect from a whodunit:<i></i> “How do you fool an audience that has come to be fooled? Johnson is so deftly able to get that joyful, wondrous reaction out of me by expertly controlling every aspect of the script and the direction in a way that makes it clear he sees the entire process as a symphony that he’s conducting, where the audience is just another instrument being played.”</p><p>Or perhaps <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/patrickhwillems/\">Patrick Willems</a> best encapsulates the joys of the film when he <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/patrickhwillems/film/knives-out-2019/\">writes</a> that <i>Knives Out</i> is “a movie as good as its sweaters (the sweaters are excellent)”. (The most popular sweater has its own story, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-knives-costume-designer-chose-chris-evans-perfect-sweater-1257525\">here</a>.) </p><p>When we got in a room with Rian Johnson recently, we naturally wanted to learn how he juggled such an impressive ensemble whilst navigating the twists, turns, and more twists of <i>Knives Out</i>’s plot.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>You’ve often talked about your lifelong love of the whodunit genre. How did you go about making your own?<br/></b><i>Rian Johnson:</i> It’s very interesting, the whodunit genre. It’s one of my favorite genres. I love all the things about it. I also kind of agree with Hitchcock. Hitchcock hated the whodunit genre. To Hitchcock, the danger of the whodunit is: it’s a lot of build-up for one big surprise at the end, and that’s not very satisfying or fun. That’s why he was all about suspense. He would give the audience information early and then you’re in suspense and not just crime-solving. He would also mislead the audience, so you’d think you’re getting all the information early. And enough so that you’re leaning forward, you’re not sitting back. That’s Hitchcock’s whole deal.</p><p>So for me, what was interesting is: can I put the engine of a Hitchcock thriller in the middle of a whodunit? Have a whodunit that then turns into a Hitchcock thriller that turns back into a whodunit? That was kind of the starting point for me, from a genre-wonk point of view.</p><p>So then I started filling out, okay what would that actually mean? I’m talking around it because I don’t wanna spoil anything, but, okay if we did <i>this</i> and then <i>that</i> could be interesting. And then I started zooming in bit by bit and filling out what characters I would need for what plot points. All the details come later but it’s as ‘big picture’ as that.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Were there ever any alternative outcomes in play?<br/></b>Not really, because I didn’t really work, like, “if this happens, then that happens, then that happens”. I worked it like a satellite map. I zoomed back. I work in little notebooks and I have to draw one line and see the entire plot along that line. So it’s not like a game of Clue where I can pick out different solutions at the end; it’s kind of set because the shape of the whole thing determines a different kind of ending from the very inception of it.</p><p><b>Watching this, I thought about your film <i>The Brothers Bloom</i>, as that’s another ode to a somewhat specific genre—the con-artist film—in which your affection for that kind of film was also evident. How challenging is it to write and shoot films in genres you grew up loving?<br/></b>Any time I’m attacking a genre it’s because I deeply, deeply love it. The heart of it for me is always trying to distill the thing I love about it and set that as the goal-post and then find my own way to it. Whether it’s the con-man movie with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-brothers-bloom/\">The Brothers Bloom</a></i>, or <i>Star Wars</i> as a genre, or this, it’s always about trying to get to the heart of what I love about something and then trying to put that on the screen so the audience will have as pure an experience of it as possible. And sometimes to give the audience the purest experience, you have to shake it a little bit, because… we’ve seen so many versions of it over the years that the audience can kind of ignore it. So sometimes you have to put it in a different context, like with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brick/\">Brick</a>,</i> with film noir or something. But the intent is always to give the audience the most sharp and vivid experience of what’s at the heart of it for me.</p><p><b>This film is a blockbuster of chemistry. Was it difficult to cast?<br/></b>Once we got Daniel on board, no. Once he was the centerpiece, I think everyone wants to work with him so it was like a snowball. Because then we got Michael Shannon, and everyone wants to work with him. And Lakeith Stanfield. So, no, the cast came together very, very quickly, just like everything else in this project. With these actors, my job is easy. They show up on set, they clicked in so easily. They’re such pros. They say casting is 90 percent of directing and it was really true in this case.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>Speaking of Daniel Craig, his character is a microcosm of the film in that he is not in any way like any detective that has come before, yet you cannot help but think of precedents. Were you consciously trying to make him unlike Hercule Poirot?<br/></b>When I started writing, I actually kinda got myself in trouble because I was thinking too much about Poirot. I love Poirot so much and I think I was thinking too much like: how do I make my Poirot? And so I started doing all this sort of quirky stuff, and throwing all these quirks in there, like maybe he has an eye patch and a peg leg maybe. It was just silly. And so finally I said “this is so stupid”, and I pulled all that stuff and I just said: “I’m gonna write this character very straightforward. The way that he needs to be for the script. And I’m gonna give him a Southern accent, because then he’s a fish out of water in New England. And then whoever I cast, I’m gonna believe that they’re gonna inhabit that character in such a way that he’ll be unique.”</p><p>I think what Daniel found—that is exactly what is at the heart of Poirot—is Daniel found kind of what’s funny about the character. Beyond the accent. He found the self-inflated, clownish aspect of him, while still maintaining a humanity and an intelligence, which is really what Poirot is. It’s why <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/peter-ustinov/\">Peter Ustinov</a> is my favorite Poirot—he gets what’s funny about the character. And like Columbo or like Miss Marple or any of the great fictional detectives, it’s that element that makes you not quite take him seriously until it’s too late and they’ve solved the whole case. I think that’s what Daniel keyed into more than anything else.</p><p><b>This feels like a film that people are going to pore over the details of, as they did with <i>Looper</i>.<br/></b>I love it because that’s part of what I love about those kinds of movies. First of all, let’s separate them, because with time-travel movies, the notion that a time-travel movie can make sense is absolute nonsense. So time travel is much more like the spells in <i>Harry Potter</i> than science, and anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves. Except maybe <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/primer/\">Shane Carruth</a>. Shane is the one person who can actually figure out time travel. Everyone else, it’s kind of like a fantasy element more than anything else.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>So with <i>Looper</i>, I felt like I had to have it make narrative sense, but I didn’t feel the pressure of it having to work in every little detail, because it can’t. Whereas, it’s a little different with a whodunit because every screw has to be tightened and I can’t leave any loose ends. I <i>do</i> want people to be able to re-watch and dig in. But I’ll be a little more sad if they find things that don’t make sense. I’m sure they will, but it’ll actually make me a little sad if they do, because I’ll be like: “I messed up there”.</p><p><b>How do you feel about your films being subjected to that kind of scrutiny?<br/></b>I think it’s fun! That’s the thing: for a certain kind of moviegoer, that’s the pleasure you get—it’s almost like the kid who if you hand them a radio, you’re gonna wanna take it apart. If that’s what someone loves about watching a movie then I think that’s fantastic. I’ve done that with certain films. I’ve watched them over and over and tried to analyze, so I get [that] that’s part of the pleasure of it.</p><p><b>How are you feeling about your <i>Star Wars</i> experience?<br/></b>As a filmmaker, as a <i>Star Wars</i> lover, it was the best experience of my life. Everything about it. Writing it. Making it. The people I got to meet. The places I got to go. The experience I had putting it out. The last two years interacting with the fans has been so rewarding and so fantastic.</p><p>I feel like I always have to say that the bad part of that gets written about a lot because it’s interesting to write about. From being in the middle of the hurricane, I can tell you that 95 percent of my interactions with fans are absolutely lovely. That’s not to say they all even <i>like</i> the movie—some of them don’t, or some of them have issues with the film—but they’re all engaged and respectful and so deeply engaged in it in a way that when you make movies you only dream that people will engage with something that you made on that level. So no, for me, the whole thing top-to-bottom has been the most beautiful experience I can possibly imagine.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p>Something that I know in my bones from being a <i>Star Wars</i> fan since I was five years old: everybody has a slightly different version of what <i>Star Wars</i> is to them, absolutely. That’s why I’m excited that stuff like [new Disney+ series] <i>The Mandalorian</i> can exist. The more <i>Star Wars</i> stuff we make, the more there’s gonna be a spectrum that gives different people the things that they want. But we also have to recognize that nothing is gonna give everybody what they want, and somebody is always gonna be upset.</p><p>What George Lucas did originally was make a movie that was straight from his heart, and expressed exactly what this world was to him. And expressed emotional truths in this world in a way that was resonant for him personally. I feel that every filmmaker who comes to <i>Star Wars</i>, that’s their job. Their job is not to take a survey and to see what is going to have the broadest demographic appeal. Their job is to speak from their heart and make a thing that resonates with what <i>Star Wars</i> is for them. And I think the more diverse filmmakers we have doing that, the more diverse <i>Star Wars</i> movies we’ll have, the more people will hopefully be happy and the less yelling there’ll be all around.</p>"

There is joy, there is quirk, there is enough air to breathe to allow for laughter and mischief.</p><p>“But every hill must go down, and <i>Parasite</i> is an incredibly balanced, plotted, and paced descent downward into darkness. The horror doesn’t rely on shock value, but rather is built upon a slow-burning dread that is rooted in the tainted soil of class, society, and duty… Bong Joon-ho dresses this disease up in beautiful sets and empathetic framing (the camera doesn’t gawk, but perceives invisible connections and overt inequalities)—only to unravel it with deft hands.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/misstayleigh/film/parasite-2019/\">Tay</a></p><p>“Bong’s use of landscape, architecture, and space is simply arresting.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dominatx/film/parasite-2019/\">Taylor Baker</a></p><p>“There is a clear and forceful guiding purpose behind the camera, and it shows. The dialogue is incredibly smart and the entire ensemble is brilliant, but the most beautiful work is perhaps done through visual language. Every single frame tells you exactly what you need to know while pulling you in to look for more—the stunning production design behind the sleek, clinical nature of one home and the cramped, gritty nature of the other sets up a playpen of contrasts for the actors and the script.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kevinyang/film/parasite-2019/\">Kevin Yang</a></p><p><b>On how to classify <i>Parasite</i>:<br/></b>“Masterfully constructed and thoroughly compelling genre piece (effortlessly transitioning between familial drama, heist movie, satirical farce, subterranean horror) about the perverse and mutating symbiotic relationship of increasingly unequal, transactional class relationships, and who can and can’t afford to be oblivious about the severe, violent material/psychic toll of capitalist accumulation.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thejoshl/film/parasite-2019/\">Josh Lewis</a></p><p>“This is an excellent argument for the inherent weakness of genre categories. Seriously, what genre is this movie? It’s all of them and none of them. It’s just <i>Parasite</i>.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nickwibert/film/parasite-2019/1/\">Nick Wibert</a></p><p>“The director refers to his furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film as a ‘family tragicomedy’, but the best thing about <i>Parasite</i> is that it gives us permission to stop trying to sort his movies into any sort of pre-existing taxonomy—with <i>Parasite</i>, Bong finally becomes a genre unto himself.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/parasite-2019/\">David Ehrlich</a></p><p><b>On the duality of the plot:<br/></b>“There are houses on hills, and houses underground. There is plenty of sun, but it isn&rsquo;t for everybody. There are people grateful to be slaves, and people unhappy to be served. There are systems that we are born into, and they create these lines that cannot be crossed. And we all dream of something better, but we’ve been living with these lines for so long that we&rsquo;ve convinced ourselves that there really isn’t anything to be done.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/faithlessphil/film/parasite-2019/\">Philbert Dy</a></p><p>“The Parks are bafflingly naive and blissfully ignorant of the fact that their success and wealth is built off the backs of the invisible working class. This obliviousness and bewilderment to social and class inequities somehow make the Parks even more despicable than if they were to be pompous and arrogant about their privilege.</p><p>“This is not to say the Kims are made to be saints by virtue of the Parks’ ignorance. The Kims are relentless and conniving as they assimilate into the Park family, leeching off their wealth and privilege. But even as the Kims become increasingly convincing in their respective roles, the film questions whether they can truly fit within this higher class.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ethanchu/film/parasite-2019/2/\">Ethan</a></p><p><b>On how the film leaps geographical barriers:<br/></b>“As a satire on social climbing and the aloofness of the upper class, it’s dead-on and has parallels to the American Dream that American viewers are unlikely to miss; as a dark comedy, it’s often laugh-aloud hilarious in its audacity; as a thriller, it has brilliantly executed moments of tension and surprises that genuinely caught me off guard; and as a drama about family dynamics, it has tender moments that stand out all the more because of how they’re juxtaposed with so much cynicism elsewhere in the film. Handling so many different tones is an immensely difficult balancing act, yet Bong handles all of it so skilfully that he makes it feel effortless.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/c_roll/film/parasite-2019/\">C. Roll</a></p><p>“One of the best things about it, I think, is the fact that I could honestly recommend it to anyone, even though I can&rsquo;t even try to describe it to someone. One may think, due to the picture’s academic praise and the general public’s misconceptions about foreign cinema, that this is some slow, artsy film for snobby cinephiles, but it’s quite the contrary: it’s entertaining, engaging and accessible from start to finish.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pedro_machado/film/parasite-2019/\">Pedro Machado</a><br/></p><p><b>On the performative nature of image:<br/></b>“A família pobre que se infiltra no espaço da família rica trata a encenação—a dissimulação, os novos papéis que cada um desempenha—como uma espécie de luta de classes travada no palco das aparências. Uma luta de classes que usa a potência da imagem e do drama (os personagens escrevem os seus textos e mudam a sua aparência para passar por outras pessoas) como uma forma de reapropriação da propriedade e dos valores alheios.</p><p>“A grande proposta de <i>Parasite</i> é reconhecer que a ideia do conhecimento, consequentemente a natureza financeira e moral desse conhecimento, não passa de uma questão de performance. No capitalismo imediatista de hoje fingir saber é mais importante do que de fato saber.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/miserybeat/film/parasite-2019/\">Arthur Tuoto</a></p><p>(Translation: “<i>The poor family that infiltrates the rich family space treats the performance—the concealment, the new roles each plays—as a kind of class struggle waged on the stage of appearances. A class struggle that uses the power of image and drama (characters write their stories and change their appearance to pass for other people) as a form of reappropriation of the property and values ​​of others.</i></p><p>“<i>Parasite’s great proposal is to recognize that the idea of ​​knowledge, therefore the financial and moral nature of that knowledge, is a matter of performance. In today’s immediate capitalism, pretending to know is more important than actually knowing</i>.”)</p><p><b>Things you’re noticing on re-watches:<br/></b>“Min and Mr. Park are both seen as powerful figures deserving of respect, and the way they dismissively respond to an earnest question about whether they truly care for the people they’re supposed to tells us a lot about how powerful people think about not just the people below them, but everyone in their lives.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/demiadejuyigbe/film/parasite-2019/2/\">Demi Adejuyigbe</a></p><p>“When I first saw the trailer and saw Song Kang-ho in a Native American headdress I was a little taken aback. But the execution of the ideas, that these rich people will siphon off of everything, whether it’s poor people or disenfranchised cultures all the way across the world just to make their son happy, without properly taking the time to understand that culture, is pretty brilliant. I noticed a lot more subtlety with that specific example this time around.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/londono/film/parasite-2019/1/\">London</a></p><p>“I only noticed it on the second viewing, but the film opens and closes on the same shot. Socks are drying on a rack hanging in the semi-basement by the window. The camera pans down to a hopeful Ki-Woo sitting on his bed… if the film shows anything, it might be that the ways we usually approach ‘solving’ poverty and ‘fixing’ the class struggle often just reinforce how things have been since the beginning.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/blockbustedpod/film/parasite-2019/2/\">Houston</a></p><!--figure[2]--><h2>The birth of the #BongHive</h2><p>London-based writer and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/\">Letterboxd member Ella Kemp</a> attended Cannes for <a href=\"https://www.culturewhisper.com/\">Culture Whisper</a>, and was waiting in the <i>Parasite</i> queue with fellow writers <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/karenhan/\">Karen Han</a> and Iana Murray when the hashtag <code>#BongHive</code> was born. Letterboxd editor Gemma Gracewood asked her to recall that day.</p><p><b>Take us back to the day that #BongHive sprang into life.<br/></b><i>Ella Kemp:</i> I’m so glad you asked. Picture the scene: we were in the queue to watch the world premiere of Bong Joon-ho’s <i>Parasite</i> at Cannes. It was toward the end of the festival; <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> had already screened…</p><p><b>Can you describe for our members what those film festival queues are like?<br/></b>The queues in Cannes are very precise, and very strict and categorized. When you’re attending the festival as press, there are a number of different tiers that you can be assigned—white tier, pink tier, blue tier or yellow tier—and that’s the queue you have to stay in. And depending on which tier you’re in, a certain number of tiers will get into the film before you, no matter how late they arrive. Now, yellow is the lowest tier and it is the tier I was in this year. But, you know, I didn’t get shut out of any films I tried to go into, so I don’t want to speak ill of being yellow!</p><p>So, spirits are still high in the yellow queue before going to see <i>Parasite</i>. I was with friends and colleagues <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ianamurray/\">Iana Murray</a> [writer for <i>GQ, i-D, Much Ado About Cinema, Little White Lies</i>], <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/karenhan/\">Karen Han</a> [<i>New York Times, Vanity Fair, Vulture, The Atlantic</i>] and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jakecunningham/\">Jake Cunningham</a> [of the Curzon and Ghibliotheque podcasts] who were also <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/karenhan/film/parasite-2019/\">very excited for the film</a>. We queued quite early, because obviously if you’re at the start of a queue and only two yellow tier people get in, you want that to be you.</p><p>So we had some time to spare, and we’re all very ‘online’ people and the 45 minutes in that queue was no different. So we just started tweeting, as you do. We thought, ‘Oh we’re just gonna tweet some stuff and see if it catches on.’ It might not, but at least we could kill some time.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenyhan/status/1182647426303365121?s=20\">So we just started tweeting <code>#BongHive</code></a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ella_kemp/status/1130924764195905536?s=20\">And not explaining it too much</a>.</p><!--tweet[1]--><p>Within the realms of stan culture, I would argue that hashtags are more applicable to actors and musicians. Ariana Grande has her army of fans and they have their own hashtag. Justin Bieber has his, One Direction, all of them. But we thought, ‘You know who needs one and doesn’t have one right now? Bong Joon-ho.’</p><p>And so, you know, we tweeted it a couple of times, but I think what mattered the most was that there was no context, there was no logic, but there was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenyhan/status/1130920951309144064?s=20\">consistency and insistence</a>. So we tweeted it two or three times, and then the film started and we thought right, let’s see if this pays off. Because it could have been disappointing and we could have not wanted to be part of, you know, any kind of hype.</p><!--tweet[2]--><p>But, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/film/parasite-2019/\"><i>Parasite</i> was <i>Parasite</i></a>. So we walked out of it and thought, ‘Oh yes, the <code>#BongHive</code> is alive and kicking.’<br/></p><p>I think what was interesting was that it came at that point in the festival when enthusiasm dipped. Everyone was very tired, and we were really tired, which is why we were tweeting illogical things. It was late at night by the time we came out of that film. It was close to midnight and we should have gone to bed, probably.</p><p><b>Because, first world problems, it is exhausting watching five, six, seven films a day at a film festival, trying to find sustenance that’s not popcorn, and form logical thoughts around these works of art.<br/></b>Yes! It was nice to have fun with something. But what happened next was [<i>Parasite</i> distributor] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neonrated/status/1130980804870303744?s=20\">Neon clocked it</a> and went, ‘<a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenyhan/status/1135698422613401600?s=20\">Oh wait, there’s something we can do there</a>’. And then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenyhan/status/1130968089984561153?s=20\">they took it</a>, and it flew into the world, and now the <code>#BongHive</code> is worldwide.</p><p><b>I love the formality of Korean language and the way that South Koreans speak of their elders with such respect. I enjoyed being on the red carpet at TIFF hearing the Korean media refer to Bong Joon-ho as ‘Director Bong’.<br/></b>It’s what he deserves!</p><p><b>I like to imagine a world where it’s ‘Director Gerwig’, ‘Director Campion’, ‘Director Sciamma’…<br/></b>Exactly. </p>"

Can you go into some detail about which life experiences fed into this film?<br/></b><i>Trey Edward Shults:</i> Where to start? In broad strokes, I was a wrestler and tore my shoulder in the same way as Tyler. The relationships between Tyler and Alexis and also Emily and Luke are inspired by my girlfriend and [me] in the good moments, bad moments, and everything in between. Their parents are inspired by my parents. I live in Florida, my cat’s in the movie. It is incredibly personal, but I had a huge collaboration with Kelvin, and then as more actors came on it got more collaborative, so it really started from this personal place and grew out of that.</p><p><b>How do you reconcile your relationship to your own suffering with the fact it’s become your livelihood and commodity?<br/></b>It’s very strange. When we recreated events in Missouri I think that was the furthest I’ve ever gone. That shoot was an all-consuming dread and I broke down, it was very hard. I would question: “Is this healthy? Is this right?”, but I came out the other side happy I did it. It was cathartic. My mom and my step-dad are therapists and I would be a total mess without them, though I’m not in therapy right now. Working through these movies is a bit of therapy.</p><p>I’m trying to make personal things that I hope connect with other people, especially this movie. Going through life and getting to the other side of it and having perspective informed me a lot. Whether it’s just tonally or pacing-wise, I wanted the film to spiritually feel that way.</p><p><b>The film’s <b>photography</b> is remarkable, especially the first act, when you have your fullest frame. Can you take us inside how you executed some of those spinning 360-degree shots?<br/></b>For the car shots we took out the middle console of the truck and put a slider that went from the backseat to the front. Basically, the dolly grip and I were crammed down hiding behind the car seats and the grip pushed the camera from the back to the front. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/drew-daniels/\">Drew</a> [Daniels, the director of photography] was in the car behind us with a remote, so he’s operating the spinning and I have a monitor in the back. That way I could talk to the kids in the car and I also had a walkie so I could talk to Drew.</p><p>A lot of the dynamic camera stuff was a case-by-case scenario, sometimes it was just running behind our steadicam operator or just hiding and letting them go and play. We wanted the camera to be purely motivated by where our main character’s emotional state of mind was, so it’s all coming from them, but then we also wanted to figure out the technical shit and make it feel to the actors that the camera disappeared and we’re not even there. So it was an interesting balance getting there. It’s a second skin for us and we know exactly what we’re after visually, but let’s disappear and let the kids play and we’ll adapt to them.</p><p><b>Since our name is ‘Letterboxd’, I feel obligated to ask you an aspect-ratio question. Can you share with us how you built this intuition to change at will—did you have films you saw that you feel did this well?<br/></b>That’s a good question, because this one really felt like it was building off what I did with <i>Krisha</i> and pushing it further. I do remember <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-grand-budapest-hotel/\">The Grand Budapest Hotel</a> </i>came out right before I started <i>Krisha</i> and it had the three aspect ratios to separate [its] time periods, which was really cool to me. I think I got really excited about using aspect ratio to echo the character’s state of mind. That was the goal with that, especially for Tyler’s trajectory.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6vyGfp8I0f8D6lBjPcoruv?si=mUwE4jf7RJOD5wiKfwGhIg\">The soundtrack</a> is getting some acclaim. Do you have any songs you wanted to fit in but couldn’t find the room, or couldn’t clear the rights for?<br/></b>I realized there were so many songs I wanted in it, but the movie told you what works. If you tried to force it on, it didn’t work. It started with the writing and it worked its way organically. The final soundtrack is pretty close to what was in the script though I think a few changed along the way. We got incredibly lucky that we got everything we wanted. I don’t know how we did it. It was a long process and our last song didn’t even clear until after Telluride and Toronto.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>There are shades of <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1UDa\">Chungking Express</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aze\">Magnolia</a></i> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/d6bE\"><i>Moonlight</i></a> in the film’s DNA. What were some other films you watched or recommended to your cast and crew as preparation?<br/></b>Funny thing is we didn’t do a lot of movie-watching for preparation. Drew and I lived in the same house so we’d always have a movie on. We were watching <a href=\"https://boxd.it/47nS\"><i>The Story of Film</i></a> a lot—the giant anthology series and study of the history of cinema, incredible. What we watched would totally range, it could be things like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1JTm\"><i>Ordinary People</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28yI\"><i>Raging Bull</i></a>, to <i><a href=\"https://boxd.it/1Zu8\">The Tree of Life</a> </i>and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1hUQ\"><i>I Am Cuba</i></a>, to <a href=\"https://boxd.it/23um\"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20E4\"><i>Punch-Drunk Love</i></a>. We would take inspiration from anything, even a film like <a href=\"https://boxd.it/1vCw\"><i>Yi Yi</i></a>. It’s a completely different cinematic approach.</p><p><b><i>Yi Yi</i> might just be the best film about family, so it’s a good start (Lulu Wang also mentioned it in <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/188684604593/creative-limitations-lulu-wang\">our recent chat with her</a> about <i>The Farewell</i>).<br/></b>That’s the thing exactly: even though <i>Waves</i> is made in such a different way, I think spiritually they’re sprawling tales of family. That’s one of my favorite movies. For the cast, we didn’t actually talk about movies that much. It was more about Florida, music and the character dynamics and all that good stuff.</p><p><b>Which movie scene makes you cry the hardest?<br/></b>One that just popped in my head is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/71E\"><i>Dancer in the Dark</i></a>. When Björk escapes in her head doing these musical numbers and it leads to the end, to the most devastating thing possible, it broke me. That movie’s rough, man. That’s not one I could watch and have good cries or something. I can’t rewatch it because it’s utterly traumatizing. I was probably crying for hours after it, I felt dead.</p><p><b>Which film makes you laugh the hardest?<br/></b>The most recent film that made me laugh the hardest is <a href=\"https://boxd.it/7eQy\"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a>. I saw it for the first time on an airplane sitting next to a stranger and I think they thought something was wrong with me. Then I got home to Florida and showed it to my girlfriend, and her brother came home and we watched it again. It never got old.</p><p><b>Who was the most relatable coming-of-age film character for you?<br/></b>It’s hard because when I was a teen I was obsessed with sports and then it was music. I’m trying to think who I related to the most. Man, I don’t know. Nothing is coming to mind. Shocking.</p><p><b>What film do you wish you made?<br/></b>I’ll go with <a href=\"https://boxd.it/20Z2\"><i>There Will Be Blood</i></a>. It’s the first film that popped in my head.</p><p><b>What mind-fuck movies changed you for life and why?<br/></b>There were three that I saw pretty close together at a young age: <i>Boogie Nights, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aVE\">A Clockwork Orange</a></i> and <i>Raging Bull</i>. I had a digital cable box in my room, so I would sneak and watch a lot of things that my parents didn’t know I was watching. They just rocked my world. Until that point it was all <a href=\"https://boxd.it/29PA\"><i>Aliens</i></a> and <a href=\"https://boxd.it/2aQY\"><i>Terminator</i></a> and every big action movie, so then when I saw those films it was like “this is what movies can be! What the hell is this?”.</p><p>I remember with <i>Raging Bull</i> I didn’t actually enjoy it. I was like, “This isn’t <a href=\"https://boxd.it/28Uk\"><i>Rocky</i></a> but I can’t stop watching.” It’s like a trainwreck and I’m fascinated but I don’t know if I like it, then I was obsessed with it and it’s one of my favorite movies now. <i>Boogie Nights</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> felt like a bigger vision was at work. It wasn’t just something made out in the ether, it was a specific singular vision and I cannot stop looking at it.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What’s the most overlooked movie from A24?<br/></b>Shoot, I wish I could look at the catalogue right now. I’m just gonna go with <a href=\"https://boxd.it/4VSG\"><i>The Spectacular Now</i></a> because I just watched it again on the airplane and I thought it was really beautiful. It’s a good one, man.</p><p><b>Lastly, it’s time for best-of-decade lists. What’s the greatest film of the 2010s? When <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/188507039573/robert-eggers\">we interviewed Robert Eggers</a>, <i>Waves</i> was his first choice.<br/></b>Shut up, come on! Oh my god, Rob’s the best. I will say that <a href=\"https://boxd.it/icFU\"><i>The Lighthouse</i></a> is my favorite film of the year, without a doubt. I’m obsessed with it. I could gush about him for hours. He’s not just one of the greatest young filmmakers, he’s one of the great filmmakers working now. Honestly though, for my decade number one I gotta go with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-tree-of-life-2011/\">The Tree of Life</a></i>. It’s one of my favorite movies of all time so I would put that at number one, and then <i>The Lighthouse</i> is close to it.</p>"

How early on in the process did you decide to not focus on his death until the closing minutes?<br/></b><i>Garret Price</i>: From the beginning. As I started digging in and learning about him, then talking to everybody, I knew this was a movie about life and how short it is. To me, the death is part of the story, but it’s not what the story is.</p><p>I didn’t know Anton, so I was learning about him as I was making this film, and I had to start at the beginning to understand who he was. There were surprises around every corner for me and I wanted to reflect those surprises in the film itself, for people who don’t know much about him, and add layers to somebody who’s already a layered individual.</p><p><b>What do you think it was about Anton that made him stand out in his generation as an actor so uniquely identifiable?<br/></b>As you say, he’s a generational talent. I don’t think you can say he’s just a natural performer. He put the work in. He just studied everything. Anyone that has a creative bone in their body can relate to him and will be inspired to do more like he did.</p><p>Also, he never wanted to be the star. He would just be at peace with it all. He was always looking under the hood, constantly talking to the production assistants, the gaffers, the directors of photography, the first assistants. He learned a lot on set.</p><p><b>In the film, Anton rants to his camera about how “you don’t get to make the cinema you want to make”. Is this a sentiment you largely agree with?<br/></b>Yep. Though for him, I don’t think it was necessarily a ‘one for me, one for them’ type thing. He loved making movies. A lot of those bigger films he made did afford him to take more risky projects that were personal, but at the same time it’s tough when you’re putting all this work in and no-one’s seeing it, or it gets bad reviews. It’s gonna eat you alive inside a little bit.</p><p>That’s what I loved when we got Willem Dafoe talking about him, because they’re very similar. Willem shared the same feelings, about how just because you take the road less travelled doesn’t mean it’s the road to travel. I think it’s a perfect way to sum up the feelings Anton felt about his choice of projects.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Along with his <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/anton-yelchin-undiscovered-photographs-exhibit\">provocative photography hobby</a>, he was starting to choose melancholic, seedier projects such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/only-lovers-left-alive/\"><i>Only Lovers Left Alive</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/green-room/\"><i>Green Room</i></a>. What do you think drew Anton to the darker side of life?<br/></b>He loved people of all walks of life. He just really latched onto all of the stories and he wanted to find a way to express them. So many people I’ve talked to in this process, especially his friends, would tell me how he would just stop to talk to anyone in the street and ask them questions. He was so present and such a listener.</p><p>It’s something about the people’s stories that you don’t get to hear about that he was drawn to, and one way of getting closer to them was the photography. He was taking photographs his whole life but never considered himself a photographer, just like he never considered himself a musician. It was just another outlet for him to express himself.</p><p><b>I assume you watched all of his films. Which was the most impressive of Anton’s performances for you?<br/></b>The one that gutted me the most was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alpha-dog/\"><i>Alpha Dog</i></a>. It’s such an amazing performance. He was fifteen years old at the time and in the documentary we show Anton getting drunk and filming himself to prepare for that role. I was like “wow”.</p><p>He was having these life experiences, like getting drunk or having his first kiss on set. He’s a coming-of-age story through the love of making movies and that really interested me. For me, <i>Green Room</i> was showing who he would become as an actor in the years to come. It breaks my heart he couldn’t do that. Also: don’t tell Drake I chose <i>Green Room</i>.</p><p><b>Do you know if there are intentions to complete Anton’s <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2016/06/anton-yelchin-died-directing-first-film-travis-callum-turner-alia-shawkat-1201691699/\"><i>Travis</i></a> film? Would that simply be too personal for anyone to take over?<br/></b>It’s only 50 pages long and the rest of the movie is in Anton’s head, so he’s the only person who could finish it. Everything he ever did in this business was leading up to directing and if he were alive today he would already have done twenty more movies. He was so prolific.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>These types of home-video documentaries should become easier to make with the advent of constant cell-phone footage. But on the other hand, I can’t imagine it having the same warmth as the physical video of the 1990s and early 2000s. How do you feel about the way technology shifts the feel of footage after a certain point in time?<br/></b>I think now, with cellphones, people are always performing, so it doesn’t feel real and authentic compared to the footage I’ve had to work on, even from fifteen to twenty years ago. There’s much more of an emotional connection to these home videos, and not just of Anton, of all of us.</p><p>There’s too much narcissism now with selfies and stuff like that. It was a different time with more true-to-life moments. You couldn’t just delete something and do it over and over again until it’s perfect. You weren’t meant to do that, and that’s the beauty of it. I can’t imagine making a portrait-type movie for this generation with the same emotion.</p><p><b>Do you intend to make fiction films or remain a documentarian?<br/></b>I’m an editor by trade. I probably do more fiction than I do documentaries. I’ve been working as a film and TV editor for fifteen years and I go back and forth. I actually think they inform each other, and that freedom is making me a stronger filmmaker.</p><p>A lot of fiction films are becoming more documentary-esque, and documentaries are becoming more like fiction films. People like to pigeon-hole certain types of filmmakers and that’s crazy; it’s all storytelling.</p><p><b>What was the film that made you want to make films?<br/></b>That’s tough. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/almost-famous/\">Almost Famous</a> </i>was the one that made me think ‘I wanna make movies’. I think that’s my favorite movie of all time. It has everything I like about filmmaking.</p>"

Arnold Schwarzenegger also shows up as an aged T-800, and the film has fun with his presence.</p><p>A few weeks back, the Alamo Drafthouse treated audiences who thought they were going to see <i>T2 </i>with a surprise screening of <i>Dark Fate</i>. “This is the third film I’ve always wanted…” was the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cjsfilms/film/terminator-dark-fate/\">reaction</a> from Letterboxd member <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cjsfilms/\">CJSFilms</a>. “Changed the story enough without completely jumping the shark and had some great new characters along with amazing work to the older ones.”</p><p>“Part of me can’t really believe I liked it so much, but it’s the truth,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/azureblueworld/film/terminator-dark-fate/\">said</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/azureblueworld/\">azureblueworld</a>.</p><p>Miller recently spoke with us about <i>Dark Fate</i>, as well as answering some questions about his life in film.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>It’s relatively rare in action cinema to have three female protagonists. What do you think that brings to <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>?<br/></b><i>Tim Miller:</i> I think it brings a lot, both in the making of it and in the film itself, because from a plot standpoint, you don’t often have enough stories where women are in these action roles. The reason that they choose to pick up a gun or punch someone in the face or fight for their lives is usually different than the reasons you’d find for a man. You don’t often find a woman killing people for vengeance or these typically macho things. So, I find those reasons much more interesting. This is why I love Sarah Connor. This is a woman who is fighting to protect her child and there is no more powerful imperative than that. So we have all of that and you have Grace coming back from the future. We really didn’t play too much upon it, but Grace is Dani’s surrogate child. She finds her in the ruin when she’s twelve and raises her. So the idea of a mother having to send her daughter back for the fate of humanity is pretty powerful and it’s not the usual male-centric reasons for doing shit like that.</p><p>Then, because we had John Connor, the whole male as the savior of humanity thing has been done. But secondly, I just feel like Dani would be a different kind of leader. I always used the analogy of yes, she’s tough and she’s a great leader, but she’s more <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/southside-with-you/\">Obama</a> than <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/patton/\">Patton</a> in my mind.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Mackenzie Davis is amazing in this movie. What kind of thinking went into the conception of her character, Grace?<br/></b>I remember the moment very clearly because my favorite author of all time, Joe Abercrombie, who writes fantasy not sci-fi, primarily, although his Shattered Sea books are sort of post-apocalyptic. Joe was in the writers’ room, I love him. He’s a great English author. If you haven’t read him, do. We were talking about how there’s always this trilogy of characters: there’s the protector, the hunter and the prey in Terminator movies. We were talking about the protector, and Joe said, “What if it’s this female super soldier who comes back from the future, and she’s all fucked up and scarred and she has to take a lot of drugs because she’s been enhanced with stolen Legion technology?” It wasn’t Legion at that time, it was stolen advanced AI technology adapted for humans and she was kind of a machine fighter. And she has to take these drugs all the time because they amp up her immune system, and jack up her reflexes and things like that. And I thought, ‘Oh, that’s fucking cool’. Everybody else did, too.</p><p>And Mackenzie plays her with so much humanity, which is why I really did not want to get the obvious casting takes for that role. They would show me some actors who were super accomplished martial artists or fighters or things like that. I knew that she would be, in many ways, the heart of the movie. I mean Sarah, of course, is the heart of the movie ultimately, but for so long in this film, Sarah is emotionless. She’s a terminator, you know? She’s fucked up. And Mackenzie had to be this person [for whom] you could really identify with her mission and her humanity.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>What movies did you watch to prepare for making <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>?<br/></b>I watched all of the Terminator movies—good and bad—again, of course. I watch <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/aliens/\">Aliens</a></i> all the time. Then I watched <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alien/\">Alien</a></i> again, too. Because I think Terminator has moments of tension, for sure. [<i>Alien³</i> director] David Fincher’s favorite moment in <i>Terminator: Dark Fate, </i>oddly, was the shots of Gabriel [Luna] walking around Carl’s house after they’ve left, in this creepy sort of home invasion moment. So I think Terminator’s always had a horror element to it.</p><p>I love movies that have heroes. Movies like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gladiator-2000/\">Gladiator</a> </i>and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner/\">Blade Runner</a> </i>are some of my favorites. <i>Gladiator</i> has the heroic element of the person who’s been beaten down but refuses to lose, [that’s] definitely in Terminator movies. <i>Blade Runner</i> has the element of the hero who gets their ass handed to them every time, but keeps getting back up and I feel like that’s kind of what happens in these chase scenes where you can never defeat a terminator. You get your ass kicked but somehow you manage to get away and fight another day until eventually something else defeats them.</p><p>I have less of a broad spectrum of movie-watching. I read a lot and that’s where a lot of my love of sci-fi comes from. I tend to—like I think a lot of nerds—you have your favorites and it’s hard to get out of that rut because it’s so <i>not</i> often that good stuff comes around that you can put on that list of favorites.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>Was there a particular film that, when you saw it, made you say, “Okay, I’m doing this. I’m gonna make movies”?<br/></b><i>Aliens</i>. The thing that Jim does so much and so well is really gives the characters a sense of reality, that they feel grounded and what I love about his movies also is the writing always feels very organic to me. In too many movies, you can feel that the writer or the director made a decision on what way to move the story based on a plot [point], rather than it coming organically from the characters. In Jim’s movies, you never feel that. In fact, when I met him I was surprised because I thought [he] must write forward from character instead of having some pre-ordained idea of where it’s going to end up. And he said, “No, oh no. I think of: ‘Oh, man. I want to see this big fucking action scene and then I work into it’.” But I guess the magic comes in the fact that you don’t <i>feel</i> that.</p><p>He mentioned the flying scene in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/avatar/\">Avatar</a></i>, which I loved, which is this falling-in-love scene when they’re learning to fly. I said, “But you have this great falling-in-love scene.” He goes, “I just wanted to do a really great scene of them flying around Pandora in these cool, swooping camera moves and this bad-ass flight sequence. And then it became the falling-in-love sequence.” So that was the surprise for me and a little bit of insight into Jim’s magic.</p><p><b>How many times would you say you’ve seen <i>Aliens</i>?<br/></b>Oh fuck, 50 plus, easy.</p><p><b>What&rsquo;s the sexiest film you’ve ever seen?<br/></b>The sexiest? <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nine-1-2-weeks/\">9½ Weeks</a>.</i></p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>What film do you have fond memories of watching with your parents?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-poseidon-adventure/\">Poseidon Adventure</a></i>, the original. I remember Gene Hackman. I remember Shelley Winters’ death where she was the Olympic swimmer who gained too much weight, but she managed to save everybody. Then I remember Gene Hackman jumping out over the fire to turn off that big knob to cut the steam off so everybody else could escape and then dropping into the fire. Heroes. Always heroes sacrificing. I love it.</p><p><b>What classic are you embarrassed to say you haven’t seen?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/citizen-kane/\">Citizen Kane</a></i>. That’s easy.</p><p><b>What filmmaker, living or dead, do you envy or admire the most?<br/></b>David Fincher, who I’m lucky enough to call a friend. David hasn’t made a bad movie ever.</p><p><b>What’s it like working with him [the pair collaborated on the Netflix sci-fi anthology series <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dhruul/list/love-death-robots-series-1/\">Love Death + Robots</a></i>]?<br/></b>David’s great with me. He’s much more trouble if you’re an executive who tries to fuck with him. I couldn’t tell you why, to this day, that he and I are friends because I’m so messy and he’s so precise, but he’s been so helpful to me as a friend and as a mentor over the years that I can’t underestimate the value of it. He’s the funniest, smartest guy in the room wherever he is.</p><p><!--figure[7]--></p><p><b>He’s kind of enigmatic. I love how seemingly quiet he is. He doesn’t put a huge amount of himself out there.<br/></b>Well, that’s in contrast to how quiet he’s <i>not</i> when he’s one-on-one or in a meeting, because he loves to talk. He puts on a show and his knowledge of film and filmmaking is so encyclopedic that you really just kind of sit back and watch. When we were pitching <i>Heavy Metal</i>, which was pretty much <i>Love, Death + Robots </i>before it was <i>Love, Death + Robots</i>, we pitched probably 100 times. It was always really great for me to sit back and watch him work, because back then it was pre-<i>Deadpool </i>and nobody really paid attention to me in the room. So I got a front-row seat to watching David work and especially watching him work in the Hollywood system, which is a unique and interesting system.</p><p><b>What’s a film you wish you had made?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/saving-private-ryan/\">Saving Private Ryan</a>. </i>Again, I’m such a one-dimensional filmmaker. It all comes back to heroism. The fact that all of them could sacrifice for this mother that they don’t know, where they imagine her hearing this news of all of her sons being dead. That’s really who they sacrifice themselves for because they don’t know Ryan, he’s just another guy. It’s a powerful message about humanity that I thought was great. Tom Hanks is just, he’s the most amazing combination of strong and vulnerable, which I find really interesting in a hero. That’s very human, you know?</p><p><b>If you were forced to remake any classic, what would you choose?<br/></b>I’m very interested to see what Denis Villeneuve does with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dune-2020/\">Dune</a> </i>because it’s a great book and they’ve never managed to make a good movie out of it.</p>"

How does it feel that your film is being so well received?<br/></b><i>Lulu Wang:</i> I fought really hard to tell the story in such a specific way that in some ways I think my biggest fear was that the specificity would put us into a niche, and only attract a very niche audience. So, you know, the fact that there’s so many people—Asian-Americans but also non-Asian Americans—who see themselves and their family in the story is incredible to me.</p><p><b>You often mention the films of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mike-leigh/\">Mike Leigh</a> when talking about highly specific stories that nevertheless have a universal resonance. Can you talk about some other such films and filmmakers that do this for you?<br/></b>Well, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/yi-yi/\"><i>Yi-Yi</i></a> [directed by] Edward Yang is one of my all-time favorites. The specificity, the tenderness of it. The patience of the filmmaking. I find <i>Yi-Yi</i> to be that. Also the humor, there’s so much charm and so much humor in it, it feels just so real.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/hirokazu-kore-eda/\">Kore-eda</a>’s films speak to me in that same way. I just really appreciate the patience in filmmaking. I think so often nowadays the flashiest things get the most attention, and we’ve also trained our brains to need that, right? That kind of stimulation. And so there’s something just so beautiful about a film that takes its time and that doesn’t lean on easy tricks to get attention, but that takes time to get to the heart of something very nuanced, that isn’t so obvious, that isn’t so black and white. The media’s already polarizing enough; I guess I’m looking for things that are not polarizing and are much more nuanced about the human condition.</p><p><b>Through <i>The Farewell</i>’s run, you’ve been generous about opening up the filmmaking process—<a href=\"https://video.vanityfair.com/watch/notes-on-a-scene-the-farewell-director-breaks-down-the-movie-s-script\">this <i>Vanity Fair</i> bilingual script breakdown</a>, for example, gives a good insight into how hard you worked on the script. Could you talk us through the ‘wedding portrait sequence’, in which Billi’s cousin and his wife have a series of photographs taken while Billi and Nai Nai carry on a long conversation? It’s entertaining, but it’s also important for what it reveals about Nai Nai and Billi’s relationship, Chinese wedding culture, and the underlying lie of the whole story. You must be so proud of this sequence.<br/></b>I am. Yeah, I’m really proud of that sequence. The photo portrait was kind of inspired a little bit by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/secrets-lies/\"><i>Secrets and Lies</i></a>, when he takes the portrait, and the falseness of what we present when we take portraits like that in the studio, right?</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>One of the intentions, going through it, was minimising the dialogue and trying to condense the script, and so that made me say, “Okay, what are all these moments doing?” They’re all trying to do the same thing, which is to establish the relationship between Billi and Nai Nai, so condensing it into one sequence makes sense. And then also because so much of it is dialogue-driven, how do we make this cinematic? Because at one point the wedding photography studio was separate from these conversations between Billi and Nai Nai, you know, and so this is where, in some ways, being forced to have limitations, being forced to make a shorter film, you start to think more about layering and how do you do multiple things at once.</p><p>I really appreciate the limitations of independent filmmaking. Not always; when I’m on set and I get the budget I’m complaining! But looking back on it, those limitations are how we came up with many of our visual ideas. And then also of course it was influenced by the location itself, because we were scouting wedding studios and I wasn’t aware that these studios were so large, that they have, like, different spaces built into the same building. Because if you look at a western photo studio, like in Mike Leigh, right, it’s always the same backdrop. </p><p>So that sequence was inspired because we went location scouting, and we were like “this is ridiculous! There are ten different rooms and they all have different set ups!” So then we had this idea of them basically just wandering through the whole photography studio and we’d pick four of our favorite set-ups. </p><p>And then this idea of them being silhouetted was inspired by [Woody Allen’s 1979 film] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/manhattan/\"><i>Manhattan</i></a>. I wanted to capture their relationship as a romance, and I was thinking about <i>Manhattan</i> and their silhouette—I think they were in a planetarium—so we came up with this idea of a continuous conversation, but that was spaced out in front of different backdrops.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>That sequence helps us learn more about who Nai Nai was before the events in <i>The Farewell</i> take place. At Letterboxd, we’re often compiling top ten lists, but “best grandmothers on film” is not a highly populated category, especially films where grandmas are more than just ‘kindly’. Tell us more about fleshing out Nai Nai’s life and the importance of giving respect to older female characters.<br/></b>I think about that in life, too, you know. We think about a lot of people in our lives as fulfilling a particular role in relation to ourselves. That’s my mother, that’s my grandmother, that’s my teacher. Remember as a kid you don’t even think your teacher goes to the grocery store! They hide in the back of the class and then pop back up in the morning! So as a filmmaker, as a storyteller, I’m always thinking about who they are, separate from the context of their relationship to you.</p><p>That’s also part of the sadness of not being with somebody or of losing somebody is you don’t necessarily get to see them in all those different contexts and then when they’re gone, there’s so much you don’t know about them and may never know about them. And as our parents get older, your relationships to your relatives change, you know, like ‘who’s the parent?’—children often have to become the caretaker. That’s where it came from, was wanting to make sure that Nai Nai was not presented as a stereotypical grandmother. That she felt like a three-dimensional woman, a woman who was once a girl, and a young woman, someone who was once in love, or maybe in a relationship out of convenience. And also that she’s not always sweet. That’s very real.</p><p><b>One of the motifs in <i>The Farewell </i>is birds appearing at significant moments. In many cultures, a bird is a portent of something big, for example, a death in the family. Where did your bird come from?<br/></b>The bird for me came from wanting to put [in] something magical, but not, like, literal, you know? Meaning, I wanted to insinuate spirituality and magic, but I wanted it also to be interactive with the audience, so based on what they believe and how they interpret that bird is the meaning they get out of it, without me saying “this is what it means”. Much of the movie is about belief systems and perspectives, so I think that if you believe the bird means something, then it does. But if you don’t, and you’re a much more literal, scientific person and you go, “Oh it’s just a bird, it’s just a coincidence,” then it doesn’t mean anything.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>That’s how it is in the movie and that’s how it is in life: what you believe, and where you find meaning, becomes your reality. With Nai Nai outliving her diagnosis, the people who believe the lie is what worked will continue to believe that the lie is what worked, and people who believe that prayer is what worked… In a way, we look for signs to validate the things we believe, because it’s how we get through life! We need signs, we need meaning, even if we’re the ones who are attaching that meaning.</p><p><b>This far down the track, what is your fondest memory of the production period?<br/></b>Oh gosh, so much of it. I think just being in China, being in spaces that were in my real life, with a crew. Any time that that happened it was really emotional, like shooting in my grandmother’s neighborhood. Shooting at my grandfather’s real grave. I hadn’t seen my grandfather since I left China when I was six, because he died a few years later. To now be at his grave site, gathered there with producers and the crew, scouting it and then shooting there, you know, it was an integration of two different parts of my life that I always felt were really separate, which was my family and China and my background and culture, and then the other part of me, which is being an American, being a filmmaker in America.</p><p>In many ways, I always felt that my family didn’t understand what I wanted to do, and also I couldn’t bring who I actually was into Hollywood, there wasn’t a space for that. With this film I was able to fully integrate, bringing my American producers to China for the first time, having my grandmother come to set and see me directing with all the lights and camera and crew. Having my parents be part of the table read. It just felt, really, like I was creating from a place that felt true and real and grounded to me.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>Speaking of being grounded, what’s your go-to comfort film? The one you’ll always throw on on a rainy day?<br/></b>Oh, I know: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-philadelphia-story/\"><i>The Philadelphia Story</i></a>. I love that story.</p><p><b>What’s the film you’ve probably seen the most?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-sound-of-music/\"><i>The Sound of Music</i></a>. </p><p><b>Favorite song from it?<br/></b>Probably ‘Edelweiss’, honestly. I’ve been watching that film since I was a kid, it’s one of my parents’ favorite films. It’s such a family film for us, and every time the father sings ‘Edelweiss’ to all the kids, I get really emotional.</p><p><b>What’s the film—or films—that made you want to become a filmmaker<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/secretary/\">Secretary</a>. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-apartment/\">The Apartment</a>. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/annie-hall/\">Annie Hall</a></i>. I know that’s taboo, I shouldn’t say that, but I have to. Like, <i>Annie Hall</i>, you know? When I first saw it, I was really inspired by that. And <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-piano/\"><i>The Piano</i></a>. I think, with both <i>The Piano</i> and <i>Secretary</i>, it was the exploration of female desire and female voice—and obviously as a trained classical pianist since the age of four, the symbol of the piano for her, for that character, and for me, was really meaningful.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>Alex Weston’s soundtrack for <i>The Farewell</i>, <a href=\"https://hiddenremote.com/2019/07/26/behind-music-interview-farewells-alex-weston/\">which leans heavily on human voices</a>, is something you worked closely with him on. What’s your all-time favorite film soundtrack?<br/></b>So many, I don’t know how to choose! Well, I have a couple. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/in-the-mood-for-love/\"><i>In the Mood for Love</i></a>. And then, because it is related, Barry [Jenkin]’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/if-beale-street-could-talk/\"><i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i></a> is one of the most astounding soundtracks. Barry was inspired by Wong Kar-wai for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moonlight-2016/\"><i>Moonlight</i></a>, and so yeah, thinking about <i>In the Mood for Love</i> reminded me that Nick Britell’s <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i> soundtrack is just incredible.</p><p><b>Holiday season is fast approaching: what’s your favorite holiday/Christmas film?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/home-alone/\"><i>Home Alone</i></a> is a classic that we all watch. Does <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fiddler-on-the-roof/\"><i>Fiddler on the Roof</i></a> count as a Christmas film?! I don’t know. That’s my mom’s favorite. And then I have a really embarrassing one, because when we got sick of <i>Home Alone</i>, we had to pick a new one, and somehow we landed on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jingle-all-the-way/\"><i>Jingle All the Way</i></a>. For years, we watched <i>Jingle All the Way</i> and just laughed our heads off.</p><p><b>Finally, how is <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/children-of-the-new-world/\">Children of the New World</a> </i>coming along?<br/></b>Very slowly. I’m working on the script. I’m writing it. It’s gonna take a while, probably after all of the press is done so I can fully focus.</p>"

Their brotherly relationship naturally enabled the film’s dialogue to head into comedic territory, even as the story itself descends into hallucinatory horror. “Comedy is about that. You’ve gotta be able to be honest and trust yourselves. We didn’t know how it was going to play but, thankfully, I think the fart jokes work.” </p><p>Not only do the fart jokes work; the poetically trippy 1890s dialogue became instantly meme-able. It was no surprise, then, that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/the-robert-eggers-qa/\">when we invited the Letterboxd community to contribute questions</a> for this interview, many of them dwelled on the script. But first, with Hallowe’en fast-approaching, we needed to know what Eggers had planned. </p><p><b>A24 has put out <a href=\"https://a24films.com/notes/2019/10/so-you-think-you-can-dress-like-a-19th-century-lighthouse-keeper\">a helpful guide</a> for those who want to do Hallowe’en as a 19th-century lighthouse keeper. You’re in the middle of <i>The Lighthouse</i> promo tour, but have you managed to plan yours?<br/></b><i>Robert Eggers</i>: Hallowe’en was my favorite holiday growing up and I made many elaborate costumes, but now that I’m doing this, I will agree with Marilyn Manson where he says: “Hallowe’en is my day off”. It’s time for everyone else to catch up!</p><p><b>At TIFF, we spoke with your co-writer and brother Max about your collaboration. Letterboxd members <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kevinandrey/\">Kevin</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/MrRabbit7/\">MrRabbit7</a> are interested in what the writing process was like with Max. Does that relationship allow more of an ‘anything goes’ approach?<br/></b>I know my brother, so it’s easy for us to write together. My movie that was <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/alexander-skarsgrd-robert-eggers-viking-movie-the-northman.html\">leaked in the trades</a> a couple days ago [<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-northman/\"><i>The Northman</i></a>] I also wrote with another writer. I’m finding, as much as I like writing scripts on my own, it’s fun to collaborate. It’s actually joyful to pass the drafts back and forth and see how you’re lifting each other’s work up.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>We had many questions <b>(including from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lacunainc/\">John</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/austinn/\">Austin</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/TylerShobe/\">Tyler</a>) </b>about <i>The Lighthouse</i>’s dialect and vernacular. Can you tell us about the work you did in constructing dialogue in unfamiliar languages, including the sources you consulted?<br/></b>It’s a lot of research and there is some quoting the sources directly. There’s much more of that in <i>The Witch</i>, where sentences remain intact. There’s very few intact sentences from the research in this film. There’s certainly many turns-of-phrase. When I’m looking at my primary source material from the period, I’m writing down vocabulary words in my own thesaurus that I can turn to.</p><p>I tend not to write in modern English and then translate the dialect. I try to write in the dialect even as I’m learning to do it, so the thesaurus is organized more [as] moods and ideas. I’m washing my eyes with words and hoping something turns up that works as I’m moving forward. You’re studying the sentence structure and trying to find the rules. </p><p>Thankfully with <i>The Witch</i>, because it was written in early modern English, which was a golden age of English writing, there were plenty of books available to teach me what the rules were. In studying the various Puritans, I could find how different people broke the rules and did things their own way. With this film it was much harder to find that, but eventually my brother came across the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Orne_Jewett\">Sarah Orne Jewett</a>. She was writing in coastal Maine dialect, interviewing working people to get their dialect. My wife found a thesis written by Evelyn Starr Cutler where she provided rules for different dialects—where are ‘r’s omitted and where are ‘r’s added, so on and so forth—so we could create consistent dialects for both characters.</p><p><b>“Why’d ya spill yer beans?” “Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?” Everyone—even A24’s marketing team—has taken to the film with meme-able gusto (exhibit A: these <a href=\"https://twitter.com/A24/status/1176205499265703937\">goofy Lighthouse emoji</a>). How does it feel to have your deeply researched script torn apart in this affectionate, ironic way by internet culture? Does it make you hesitate in your approach to writing and directing these types of lines? (This question brought to you by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/adam_ball/\">those</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kamrynryan/\">who</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/iamanelephant/\">quoted</a> those infamous questions in response to this AMA.)<br/></b>No, it’s cool with me. <i>The Lighthouse</i> was designed to be a black comedy and not just have <i>moments</i> of black comedy. <i>The Witch</i> takes itself very seriously, but I think that there’s something kind of film student-y about how serious it takes itself. I’m glad that people can make PlayMobil and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/classicsos/status/1185005816916709381\">Lego playsets</a> as jokes. You need to be irreverent, and with <i>The Lighthouse</i> I was exploring misery again but I wanted to be able to laugh at misery. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/werner-herzog/\">Werner Herzog</a> talked about it like, you’re on the floor laughing, you know?</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>You and your brother both have deep roots in theater. After listening to your <a href=\"https://a24films.com/notes/2019/07/deep-cuts-with-robert-eggers-and-ari-aster\">A24 podcast</a> with brother-in-arms and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/midsommar/\"><i>Midsommar</i></a> director Ari Aster, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sollyf/\">Solly F</a> wants to know which playwrights you look up to, and who was particularly useful in your approach to <i>The Lighthouse</i>?<br/></b>I like Shakespeare [laughs]. I don’t know if he was particularly helpful for this, but he’s pretty good! Clearly [Harold] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/harold-pinter/\">Pinter</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/sam-shepard/\">Sam Shepard</a>, and evoking the name [Samuel] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/samuel-beckett/\">Beckett</a> is almost worse than evoking the name Shakespeare, but you know, they’re good at what they do, and for this two-hander about identity it was impossible not to think of those playwrights.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/Woah_Jack/\">Many</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pabloalex97/\">members</a> are curious about the films that inspire you and, more <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/marlon32/\">specifically</a>, your most influential Ingmar Bergman films. So, which Bergman were you looking at for <i>The Lighthouse</i>? Also, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jon_oddity/\">Evan McKenzie</a> dares to ask, “Given the chance, which Bergman film should you like to remake?”<br/></b>Well, I would not remake a Bergman movie because that’s just insanity! Even though I dared to talk about remaking <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nosferatu-2023/\"><i>Nosferatu</i></a>—which also probably does not need to be done—so I guess, yes, I am insane. Fair enough question. Obviously <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/persona/\"><i>Persona</i></a> and any of his chamber dramas would be the ones I would be thinking about here.</p><p>There’s a shot where Willem is knitting and Rob is smoking in the foreground, which Jarin [Blaschke, <i>The Witch</i> and <i>The Lighthouse</i>’s director of photography] and I referred to fondly as our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hour-of-the-wolf/\"><i>Hour of the Wolf</i></a> shot. Of course we’re using a much wider lens than Bergman ever would have done and had a different approach to lighting than he did, so it doesn’t seem all that Bergman-esque in the end, even though it was our homage. </p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.letterboxd.com/Mithras_\">Youssef</a> asks: which foreign-language films are your favorites, or provided you an entry point into the non-English language arthouse?<br/></b>The arthouse films that I saw in high school were ones that just happened to be in my local video store. Only one of them is foreign language, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-city-of-lost-children/\"><i>The City of Lost Children</i></a>, but that, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/eraserhead/\"><i>Eraserhead</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brazil/\"><i>Brazil</i></a> were three movies that I can think of that made me ask: “Oh you can do that? Wow!” Julie Taymor’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/titus/\"><i>Titus</i></a> also was another film from high school that made me realize that there was something other than—and not to speak disparagingly—Spielberg and Tim Burton and whatever was more easy to see in rural New Hampshire cinemas.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b><i>The Lighthouse</i> has an ambiguity that has led to many of our members questioning its genre. Even Ari Aster wasn’t sure when he mentioned the film <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/186341956958/ari-aster\">in his Q&amp;A</a>, and you’ve referred to it as a black comedy here. But we have to ask, for the sake of our community’s sanity: is <i>The Lighthouse</i> a horror movie?<br/></b>I don’t see it as a horror movie. But I’ve definitely spoken to people who get my intentions that think it is. So maybe? I don’t care what people call it.</p><p><b>It’ll probably make our top horror lists, if that’s okay.<br/></b>That’s fine.</p><p><b>Let’s not tease too many hypotheticals, since this question is based only on your two-feature output so far, but there is significant interest in whether you’ll branch out into other genres, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dielfo/\">specifically sci-fi</a>, and other time periods, <a href=\"http://www.letterboxd.com/genohgeray\">specifically the future</a>.<br/></b>Well again, pointing to the leaked Viking movie, that ain’t a horror movie. And I’ve written other movies that aren’t horror movies. It’s just <i>The Witch</i> and everything that I’ve actually gotten made so far have been horror or horror adjacent. That’s just how it’s been—fine, happy about it.</p><p>Never say never because I am interested in sci-fi. I feel like generally when people are trying to ask big questions and challenge current philosophies, to look at things that are bigger than ourselves today, it’s always done with sci-fi. So for me, I’m enjoying doing that kind of stuff in the past just because that’s not how people often use historical movies today.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>We love asking filmmakers this and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/fffillyy/\">Filbert</a> wants to know: what are your go-to comfort films? The movies you’ve seen the most? Anything that could surprise us?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-lebowski/\"><i>The Big Lebowski</i></a> I’ve watched a lot. We have a little bit of a nod to it in <i>The Lighthouse</i> when [Pattinson] throws their shit off the cliff and it hits him in the face. It’s pretty damn close to the ashes of Steve Buscemi. I think it’s not going to surprise anyone that I’ve seen <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shining/\"><i>The Shining</i></a> a zillion times. I’ve seen <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mary-poppins/\"><i>Mary Poppins</i></a> a lot, and we have a little nod to it with our weather-vane shot.</p><p>By the way, when I’m writing it I’m not thinking ‘this is the <i>Big Lebowski</i> scene’ or ‘this is the <i>Mary Poppins</i> scene’. I’m just kind of writing and you say, “well, I know where that came from.”</p><p><b>Finally, the 2010s are drawing to a close and many of us, including <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/maxt26/\">Max</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jvonck/\">John</a>, would like to know: what are your essential films of the decade?<br/></b>I’d have to think about it more, but recently I thought Trey Edward Shults’ <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/waves-2019/\"><i>Waves</i></a> is great, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hereditary/\"><i>Hereditary</i></a> is great, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/\"><i>Parasite</i></a>’s great… I’m sorry, I haven’t seen <i>Parasite</i> [laughs]. That’s a microaggression, I meant to say <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/burning-2018/\"><i>Burning</i></a> is great. Anything by Ciro Guerra [director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/embrace-of-the-serpent/\"><i>Embrace of the Serpent</i></a> and co-director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/birds-of-passage-2018/\"><i>Birds of Passage</i></a>] is great.

That’s the power of Céline Sciamma and her <i>Portrait</i>.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Diving deeper, Sciamma’s top-tier triumph exemplifies a few key patterns. She returns at number 64 with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tomboy-2011/\">Tomboy</a></i>, reminding us what a great shame it is that her excellent feature <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/girlhood-2014/\">Girlhood</a></i> didn’t make the list, but confirming that France appears to be one of the best countries in the world for women to make movies: the list comprises 23 French features, which, considering the US’s oft-perceived monopoly on the film industry, feels monumental.</p><p>But of course, it’s not accidental either. This year sadly marked the passing of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/agnes-varda/\">Agnès Varda</a>, indisputably the GOAT. She stands proud as the most prolific contributor with six features, two in the top 20. To grieve, to remember, at least we can always keep watching.</p><p>Another singular trailblazer is Scotswoman <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/lynne-ramsay/\">Lynne Ramsay</a>. She has four entries, but what’s most impressive is that these are, well, all the feature films she’s made to date. Her fourth entry, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/morvern-callar/\">Morvern Callar</a></i>, sneaks in at number 100.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/elaine-may/\">Elaine May</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/chantal-akerman/\">Chantal Akerman</a> both have three entries, which may come as no surprise to cinephiles, but it’s also the same number of entries as Japanese animator <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/naoko-yamada/\">Naoko Yamada</a> (whose <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-silent-voice/\"><i>A Silent Voice</i></a> sits in sixteenth place on our list). This reveals an open-minded slant, one that acknowledges the widely perceived touchstones but also embraces further-reaching works from lesser-known artists. Five features are Japanese, four are German, three Italian, and three Indian.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>The lean still remains very much with the US, and yet few films on the list break records for eye-watering budgets. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-matrix/\">The Matrix</a></i>, courtesy of the Wachowskis, was made for $63 million, and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shrek/\">Shrek</a></i>, co-directed by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/vicky-jenson/\">Vicky Jenson</a>, had a budget of $60 million. Aside from these two, projects on the list seldom had more than $10–15 million to get the job done.</p><p>When looking at the list’s omissions, one almost unanimous absence is that of<a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/17-highest-grossing-movies-directed-by-women/\"> the highest-grossing films of all time directed by women</a>. No <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle/\">Sleepless in Seattle</a></i>, no <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/frozen-2013/\">Frozen</a></i>, no <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey/\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></i>. No <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nora-ephron/\">Nora Ephron</a>, No <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nancy-meyers/\">Nancy Meyers</a>. No <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ava-duvernay/\">Ava DuVernay</a>. It’s a peculiar gap, as the influence of these writers and filmmakers is hardly one to be contested. And, to close the circle on big budgets, $120-150-million-wielding <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/patty-jenkins/\">Patty Jenkins</a> is also absent. The <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wonder-woman-2017/\">highest-grossing film</a> directed by a woman (with no male directing partner)—a cool $821.8 million at the global box office—did not make the cut.</p><p>On this topic, there are sixteen films co-directed by women on the list. A co-directing mention is a crucial credit. It’s like the trust exercises that used to be taught in school drama classes—how would they work if one party wasn’t there to catch the other as they fell? What’s the point in being brave if you don’t also have some kind of promise of safety? Partners need each other, and these directors needed partners to reach the heights they did. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/city-of-god/\">City of God</a></i>, co-directed by Fernando Meirelles and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/co-director/katia-lund/\">Kátia Lund</a>, was nominated for four Oscars, and yet Meirelles was still the only filmmaker credited at the ceremony. The Academy chose to disregard Lund, but our list does not. There are five female co-directors in the top 20. One of the highest-grossing films on the list, <i>Shrek</i>, would not be what it is without Vicky Jenson.</p><p>Also curious: Palme d’Or winner <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jane-campion/\">Jane Campion</a> makes the list, best director Oscar winner <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kathryn-bigelow/\">Kathryn Bigelow</a> does not. Overall, the list shows a vast body of skill, a crop of familiar names, some deeply felt absences and—hopefully—a whole lot of additions to watchlists. Further names that deserve to be sought out, in no particular order, include <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mabel-normand/\">Mabel Normand</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/maya-deren/\">Maya Deren</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/josephine-decker/\">Josephine Decker</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jennie-livingston/\">Jennie Livingston</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mia-hansen-love/\">Mia Hansen-Løve</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/dee-rees/\">Dee Rees</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/joanna-hogg/\">Joanna Hogg</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/gurinder-chadha/\">Gurinder Chadha</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/barbara-hammer/\">Barbara Hammer</a>, and directors with new films soon to be released: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/marielle-heller/\">Marielle Heller</a> (<i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood)</i>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/niki-caro/\">Niki Caro</a> (the live-action <i>Mulan</i>) and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kasi-lemmons/\">Kasi Lemmons</a> (<i>Harriet)</i>.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Writing this breakdown gave me plenty of homework, and it shed light on a lot of works that I’m yet to catch up with. At first I thought it pretty normal to not have seen as many on the list as I would have liked, taking into account my age, access and time, but the further I went, the more names cropped up that I didn’t recognize, and the more I recalled my three years studying film at university and not having learned anything about so many of these women. </p><p>I should know more names. I should have been set more assignments regarding more of these names. I can do more, but so too can those above me, those who taught me and continue to teach others, about who makes the films that are worth learning about. We now have lists such as this one—it’s high time we start to properly use them.</p>"

This is far from the strangest thing that will happen to a child in <i>Greener Grass</i>.</p><p>We needed to know where this wild duo get their filmmaking inspiration from. When we spoke with DeBoer and Luebbe they were in “high heaven”, having just held the LA premiere of <i>Greener Grass</i>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>What were some of the real-life ‘greener grass’ moments that inspired your film?<br/></b><i>Dawn Luebbe</i>: There’s one story which Jocelyn tells about her aunt who was at a dinner party one night. She was in the kitchen talking to the host and complimented them on her apron—“that’s a cute apron!”—and the host took it off and said it “you must have it, take my apron.” At once she was like, “oh no, I just like it, I don’t need it,” and the host insisted and wouldn’t drop it. So that night Jocelyn’s aunt left with that apron. Of course, that’s just a very small example of politeness taken to the extreme. We took that general vibe and added to it and really blew it out.</p><p><i>Jocelyn DeBoer</i>: I feel like we experience this at restaurants too. Dawn and I are from the Midwest, so we have a problem where no-one ever really wants to eat the last bite of something that’s shared. I do remember one experience where I was on a double-date with some acquaintances I didn’t know so well and we were eating sushi. Someone had those crispy rice things that have some spicy tuna on top and when the waiter brought it out, one of them fell to the floor. Our friend just picked it up and said “10 second rule!”. The waiter felt bad and offered to bring new ones and we were saying, “Yes, get the new sushi. Don’t eat that one off the floor!” But the person didn’t want to make the waiter feel bad and ate it right in front of them. I thought, ‘this is a <i>Greener Grass</i> moment for sure!’.</p><p><b>You’ve said elsewhere that you tried to avoid referencing other films in the development of yours, but can you tell us some films that you love, that peddle in the same story area of ‘demented suburbia’?<br/></b><i>JD:</i> We always admit that we were watching <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/twin-peaks/\"><i>Twin Peaks</i></a> together at the time we were making our short, so there’s no denying that David Lynch is an inspiration to us. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mulholland-drive/\">Mulholland Drive</a>,</i> of course. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blue-velvet/\">Blue Velvet</a>,</i> too. The two of us just love <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/john-waters-2/\">John Waters</a>, he rocks.</p><p><i>DL:</i> We love how John Waters satirizes suburbia but he also clearly has such love and adoration for it too. It’s our dream to strike the same balance.</p><p><i>JD:</i> Yeah, we’re laughing with the people we grew up with, not just at them.</p><p><i>DL:</i> I would say also <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/edward-scissorhands/\"><i>Edward Scissorhands</i></a> was another movie that was a point of reference in terms of the bright pastel color-block world, with this element of darkness filtering in.</p><p><i>JD:</i> We love satires like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brazil/\"><i>Brazil</i></a>, the visual comedy especially. We both loved that surreal world. Luis Buñuel, of course, with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie/\"><i>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</i></a>, has the sketch-like aspects in a narrative film we wanted to do.

I tried very much to cram in what I can and then I discovered I actually love horror movies.</p><p><i>JD:</i> The funny thing is that no-one loves true crime more than Dawn!</p><p><i>DL:</i> Yes, true crime is my greatest passion.</p><p><b>Which film turned you onto horror, Dawn?<br/></b><i>DL:</i> I actually think it was <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i>. I saw that and thought ‘this is very scary and I love it’. This is more recent, but <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/get-out-2017/\">Get Out</a>,</i> too. I found the marriage of comedy and horror to just be incredible and the visuals in that movie, to have such a sense of cinematic comedy-horror, just blew my mind.</p><p><b>You gave some of the best lines to the child actors in <i>Greener Grass</i>. What was your approach to working with them to capture the absurd spirit of the film?<br/></b><i>DL:</i> That’s so nice! We absolutely love Julian Hilliard, who plays Julian, and Asher Miles Fallica, who plays Bob. From the second we saw their audition tape, they so got the tone, the characters, and they just jumped off the screen for us. They’re so mature in a way. They understood the comedy and the tone in a way we did not anticipate.</p><p><i>JD:</i> They took their roles so seriously. One story we love about Julian is how he had to fall in the pool and we shot that very early on. We told him we want him to fall just like a plank and we’re showing him YouTube videos of planking so he was practising it in the hotel pool. We went on the day to shoot that scene, and the take that’s in the movie is our first and only take. He just nailed it perfectly. A couple weeks later, we went to shoot the first scene of the movie, which is when he falls in the soccer field. We go to shoot it and Julian starts to fall in a hard plank, just like he did in the pool but on the grass. We were like, “wait, no no no, you don’t have to fall like that!” and he just looked at us and went, “but that’s how Julian falls!”</p><p><b>What streaming platform is <i>Kids with Knives</i> on? Seriously: we’re fans of films that build a complete world within, including the fake shows and commercials you see playing on television sets. Can you tell us some inside stories of developing those?<br/></b><i>JD:</i> Those were so much fun for us to work on.</p><p><i>DL:</i> These kids were just so incredibly enthusiastic and Jocelyn had them circle round and asked them what kind of gymnastics can you do, let’s see what you got. And then one after the other they were doing the splits, back-handstands… We thought, ‘this is great—<i>Gymnastics and Knives</i>!’ We should have been filming that.</p><p><b>We’ve really enjoyed showing <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/greener-grass-2019/trailer/\">your trailer</a> to people for that ‘what-the-fuck’ reaction. What’s a bizarre film that you love to recommend to people? (We asked this <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/188077517198/life-in-film-daniel-scheinert\">same question to Daniel Scheinert</a> who directed <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/swiss-army-man/\">Swiss Army Man</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-death-of-dick-long/\">The Death of Dick Long</a></i> and he said <i>Greener Grass</i>.)<br/></b><i>JD:</i> Wait, are you kidding?! That’s so nice, oh my gosh! The first film that came to mind is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dogtooth/\"><i>Dogtooth</i></a>. I’m always curious to talk to people about that one. Dawn, what about <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-swimmer/\"><i>The Swimmer</i></a>? Have you seen <i>The Swimmer</i>? You have to. It’s the Burt Lancaster vehicle.</p><p><i>DL:</i> It’s about a man who crosses his county by swimming across every swimming pool. I’ll just say: what you think the movie is in the beginning turns out to be very different to what the movie is. The protagonist changes quite a bit.</p><p><i>JD:</i> One of the coolest things about how we’re travelling the world promoting <i>Greener Grass</i> is how we get to talk to people afterwards and they go, “Oh the movie reminds me of this, it reminds me of that.” It was the director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/fantasticfest/\">Fantastic Fest</a> who told us we have to watch <i>The Swimmer</i>. We watched it on the plane and there is a scene where a man is kind of obsessed with the filtration system in his pool. Everyone is talking about how great their pools are the whole movie, so yes, this is like our movie, thank you.</p><p><i>DL:</i> There’s also a passionate monologue about a hot-dog wagon that’s the best thing that ever happened in cinema.</p><p><i>JD:</i> It’s fantastic!</p><p><b>What are your go-to comfort movies? How many times do you think you’ve seen them?<br/></b><i>DL:</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory/\"><i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i></a> I’ve probably seen 500 times.</p><p><i>JD:</i> I really love <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dumb-and-dumber/\"><i>Dumb &amp; Dumber</i></a>. I’m also a big comfort watcher of the <i>Sex and the City</i> TV show but I don’t recommend the movies!</p><p><b>What’s a film you wish you had made?<br/></b><i>JD:</i> I want to say <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/roma-2018/\"><i>Roma</i></a>, but that movie couldn’t be more different from <i>Greener Grass</i>. I loved it.</p><p><i>DL:</i> For me, I’ll say <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/waiting-for-guffman/\"><i>Waiting for Guffman</i></a>. It has such a special place in my heart. I just remember when I was probably fifteen or sixteen seeing that movie in Nebraska and laughing so hard my stomach hurt and thinking, ‘wow, movies can be like this?’</p><p><b>What’s a beloved movie you couldn’t get into?<br/></b><i>JD:</i> Now I just feel bad talking about other films in a bad way. I’m really glad this film exists—but personally I had trouble getting into the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wonder-woman-2017/\"><i>Wonder Woman</i></a> movie. I think there’s a lot of cool things about it. Maybe I’m just over superhero movies.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://25yearslatersite.com/2019/02/19/greener-grass-jocelyn-deboer-dawn-luebbe-and-natalie-metzger-reveal-the-behind-the-scenes-secrets-of-their-sundance-hit/\">You told a journalist at Sundance</a> that you “did have one storyline that you pulled late in the game in fear that it might be taking something too far. We still fight about that decision and Dawn is wrong”. Are you prepared to tell us that twist now?!<br/></b><i>JD:</i> I don’t know why I said that because we just set ourselves up to be asked that all the time. We are not going to tell you what it is, but we can tell you one storyline that Dawn and I actually loved that we ended up cutting before going into production. In a previous draft of ours, Buck, Kim Ann’s husband, who she divorces and he starts to become a cowboy, shows up at a kid’s birthday party with a new girlfriend and all the women are gossiping about, “Oh no, did you hear Buck has a new girlfriend, her name is Pamela,” and, well, she’s just hair. It turns out when we meet Pamela, she is just a very large, floating blowout. At this time Buck was also trying to sell a jet-ski because Pamela can’t do wind. It was a favorite bit of ours.</p><p>We did a few script readings with our comedy writer friends and paid attention to what people laughed at and what people talked about afterwards. No-one ever mentioned Pamela. They didn’t say she was confusing, they didn’t say they liked her nor that they didn’t like her. And we were, like, for just a character who’s all hair to not be spoken about at all, it’s not a good sign and we should lose her. Since then, we had people who read those scripts and [said]: “Why is Pamela not in the movie?!” and we’re now “Well, damn. We don’t know!”</p><p><i>DL:</i> Maybe we’ll make a movie about Pamela one day.</p><p><b>You were working with such a great cast of improvisers. How did you strike a balance between what you had on the page, and what they could bring on set; in what ways did they surprise and delight you? Not only your actors, but for the artists on set such as your costume and production designers.<br/></b><i>DL:</i> We were just so blessed to work with these incredible improvisers; Mary Holland (Kim Ann), D’Arcy Carden (the school-teacher, Miss Human), Neil Casey (Lisa’s husband, Dennis) and Beck Bennett (Jill’s husband, Nick). It was such a gift. I would say the movie is probably 95% scripted, so it was pretty close to the script. There were a number of improv moments in the final cut that we absolutely loved. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Kim Ann is sitting on her porch and Jill arrives and hands her a taco dip and Kim Ann asks “is it seven layers?” and Jill admits it’s only five and Kim Ann says “put it on the floor!” That line is totally improv’d by Mary in the moment. She’s just a dream.</p><p><i>JD:</i> It’s true, our designers added so many things. It was something that we talked about from the very beginning, that we want there to be comedy in every frame of the movie. We love having Easter eggs. We found one after the SXSW screening. Dennis tells a joke at the soccer field and everyone laughs way too hard and he fancies himself a comedian. In the scene in Lisa’s living room when the kids are watching <i>Kids with Knives</i> and Dennis is sleeping, we found that the production designer Leigh Poindexter added a VHS tape that’s sitting on the coffee table that’s just labeled ‘Comedy’, as if Dennis has been studying comedy for his joke, which we thought was so funny.</p><p>Our costume designer Lauren Oppelt added so many little touches, but one we really loved: Nick is always wearing our family’s color, pink, and a very gender-normative blue. After Nick and Jill get divorced, he shows up in all beige to go get more pool water, but for the little logo on his polo Lauren embroidered a sad face. It was so funny. We loved that touch.</p><p><b>Finally, a question we’ve been asking filmmakers all year: which film made you want to become filmmakers?<br/></b><i>JD:</i> It’s so, so long ago but I think for me it was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/memento/\"><i>Memento</i></a>. I saw that when it first came out in the theater, with my Dad. I was just a child then but it blew my mind.</p><p><i>DL:</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/welcome-to-the-dollhouse/\"><i>Welcome to the Dollhouse</i></a>. That was the first true dark comedy I saw where I was deeply disturbed by how much I was laughing. I want to make something like that too.</p><p><h2>Related Letterboxd Lists</h2></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ucrazyutaraptor/list/sinister-suburbia/\">Sinister Suburbia</a>: what’s really going on in that neighborhood?<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/queenbowie/list/creepy-teenage-suburbia/\">Creepy Teenage Suburbia</a>: “settings not limited to but including: high school hallways, proms, corn fields, religious dictatorships, convenience stores, football pitches, family compounds, back gardens.”</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/michaelhaneke/list/films-directed-by-women/\">Films Directed by Women</a>: Vanessa’s comprehensive—and growing—list of films directed by women.</p>"

I didn’t take that as inspiration, but that’s my favorite villain.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Read on for highlights from the rest of the conversation.</p><p><b>On being associated with the character of Maleficent:<br/></b><i>Angelina Jolie:</i> The strange thing as an actor, you’re kind of always figuring out who you are, how people see you. Now with social media, everybody has an opinion. As an actor, it’s strange, you put yourself forward [for a role] and somebody says: “Oh, that’s very you.” And you think: ‘Really, is it?’ When I got a call and they said: “We thought you’re the only person who could play Maleficent. It was so obvious.” I was like: “<i>What</i> was so obvious?” I’m never quite sure how I’m supposed to take that.</p><p>And yet, I love her. So maybe I just need to fully embrace it at this time in my life. Maybe when I first did it I thought I needed to find the other aspects of her; she’s a bit wild and full-on and a bit much. Now I have different things in my life and I’m just so happy to feel strong again and have some fun. I adore being her.</p><p><b>On whether or not she was channeling screen legend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/bette-davis/\">Bette Davis</a> in her performance:<br/></b><i>AJ: </i>When I was little, I saw the animated film. Clearly she was drawn with that inspiration, and the original voice, and the original way she was, and I was so drawn to it. All of those women. There’s so much to learn from them. Any comparison I’m very grateful for.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On how the film plays with notions of good and evil:<br/></b><i>Michelle Pfeiffer:</i> It’s a very unusual fairy tale, which I also loved about the first film, it was so surprising. What I loved is that it played in this grey area and it talked about good-versus-evil, and how all of us have a little bit of everything in us. I think in terms of strength, and how that manifests itself, it’s different in everyone. One of the things we loved about Aurora is that in many ways she is ultimately the strongest and wisest of all of us. My character is really brilliant and diabolical, but I wouldn’t consider her terribly wise.</p><p>I mean, everybody has vulnerability, and I think, [Queen Ingrith is] damaged. Nobody behaves that way unless they’re incredibly damaged on some level. She just doesn’t wear it on her sleeve, I guess. And it some ways, what she resorts to is really, truly out of a very deep fear.<br/><br/><b>On the central themes of the film:<br/></b><i>AJ:</i> It is about family. Aurora and Maleficent were brought together and they became a family and they weren’t really expecting it. Maleficent was harmed in her life and she lost herself and lost her ability to, I think, be soft and feel love. Being a mother brought out something in me that really transformed me. But we’re different creatures in the film. There are metaphors in the film, not to be heavy about it, but always I think a good film for young people has these messages, and I think there’s real questions in the film: [Aurora and Maleficent] get pulled apart, people tell us, because we’re not the same. “Because you’re not exactly like her, you’re not gonna love her.” That certainly strikes a chord with me. I think Maleficent does wonder if she’s good enough to be a mother.</p><p>Then there’s a real push to say “this is not how it should be, and this is not how to live”. Diversity makes us stronger. There must be a better way forward, and we have to come together. We do that in the film with the humans and the creatures and moor-folk coming together. We do that as a family, we come together and we fight against this separation. We unite and we say “this is the world we choose to live in”. I think that that is a really important message.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>On Aurora and Maleficent’s relationship:<br/></b><i>AJ:</i> I see her exactly as she is, and I don’t want her to be any different than she is. And she sees me as I am, and she accepts me as I am. It is to say to everybody: “Be yourself, be your true self. You don’t live forever.” Say to children: “No matter how people see you and how they say you should be, you’ll suffocate. Be your true nature, whatever that may be, and you’ll find acceptance, because you have to.”</p><p><b>On the film’s elaborate dinner scene, when Maleficent and Ingrith first encounter each other:<br/></b><i>MP:</i> Tension-wise, nobody wanted to be the one to wreck the take, because it was so long. Every angle, every shot was a master. The tension is really good, you’re kind of just being there for each other.</p><p><i>AJ: </i>I was just happy we were sitting. I felt like I was having dinner with friends for a week. I thought it was great.<br/><br/><b>On the challenge of performing inside such gargantuan costumes:</b><br/><i>AJ: </i>You get so supported in these roles with the magic, everybody working towards this idea of [bringing together] costumes, visual effects and make-up to help bring you into a creature. It’s a big team. Some of my costumes were half there, and we had to be flying with rigs and things. The trick with Maleficent sometimes is that I need to look stronger on the ground, but then I have to float when I’m up in the air.</p><p><b>On what the film has to say about self-sacrifice:</b><br/><i>AJ:</i> When you talk about love, we spoke about knowing your true self, but really I think the core of is: we’re not here just to exist. You have to know what you stand for. You have to know what you’re willing to fight for or die for. If you live that way, then whatever pain comes with it and whatever sacrifice comes with it, you embrace it and it actually fills you with purpose. That’s hopefully represented in the film.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>On whether or not she was trying to top her previous villain performances:<br/></b><i>MP: </i>I didn’t actually look at it that way. I certainly enjoyed playing this, I was really delighted and surprised when I read the script. I was excited just by the notion of working with [Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning].</p><p>You approach them all differently. I had a lot of fun doing this. I felt like I had a lot of freedom to try and bring some other colors, you know, try to play the humanity. It may not appear at first blush that Ingrith is willing to sacrifice anything, but she’s willing obviously to sacrifice her son. I think that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love him. (Laughs.) It’s complicated.</p><p><b>On relating to Maleficent having to let go of Aurora, given that she just sent her oldest son off to college:</b><br/><i>AJ:</i> To be very honest, Maddox was so ready and he’s doing so well. He spent these days with me as I thought I was preparing him to go. You work so hard as a mother, you think: ‘I’m really helping him.’ And then at the airport, he could’ve left but he stayed with me a bit longer, I kept thinking: ‘He wants to be with me a little longer.’ And then at some point he looked at me and said: “Are you okay?” and I said “Yeah I’m fine” and I realized the entire week was all for me. He was just making sure I was okay. And he gave me a really big hug because he knew that I needed it, and I knew that he was okay because he was the kind of man who knew what I needed and he gave it to me in a loving way. So I left feeling really proud. I did cry a few times.</p><p>There’s a part of this movie where I have to let [Aurora] go. It wasn’t in the script, but I didn’t quite let her go. And Diaval (Sam Riley) has to come in and say: “Let her go.” And that got me every time. Because I would think of… all of the kids. That moment of having to let them go. But it’s also exciting.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>Related content</b></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/smd2006/list/everything-on-disney-plus/\">Everything on Disney+</a>: a list of all the films that will feature on the studio’s new streaming service, launching in the US on November 12.<br/></p><p>Rara’s list of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rara/list/films-with-both-female-heroes-villains/\">films with both female heroes and female villains</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/mommie-dearest/\">Mommie Dearest: the Letterboxd Showdown of misunderstood movie matriarchs.</a></p>"

For the rich house, I already had a basic sketch of the structure as I wrote the script. I had specific requirements in terms of what the characters would or would not be able to see from certain positions, where they could eavesdrop, how they would move from one position to the next, and the like. I handed that rough sketch to the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/production-design/lee-ha-jun/\">production designer</a> [Lee Ha-jun], and he worked with actual architects to ensure that the house looks beautiful and believable, while meeting all my demands.</p><p>Also, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/hong-kyung-pyo/\">the DP</a> [Hong Kyung-pyo] and I wanted to use natural sunlight as much as possible, so we observed the sun’s position throughout the day to determine the direction and design of the house. In terms of interior design, the production designer filled the space with very expensive furniture, props, and décor; even the trash can was expensive. I remember the production designer and line producer being very anxious on set and pleading with us to be careful not to scratch anything as most of them were rented.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>For the poor neighborhood, the art and set department actually visited neighborhoods scheduled to be redeveloped, and went inside abandoned homes to take the doors, window sash, tiles, and other materials to build the set with. They ended up adding a realistic texture to the neighborhood; even Korean audiences didn’t realize it was all built. And due to the flood sequence, we had to build it in a water tank. We filled it up with water on the last two days of shooting there. We added in facial mud masks to give the water that sewage color. Great skincare for my actors.</p><p><b>What film is the definition of a South Korean masterpiece?<br/></b>The 1960 film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-housemaid/\"><i>The Housemaid</i></a> by Kim Ki Young is a true Korean masterpiece. The film was restored by Martin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation and screened at Cannes Classics. It’s also available in the Criterion Collection.</p><p><b>You’ve talked before about how 1970s American cinema inspired you to become a filmmaker. Can you name some specific films that particularly made you go “this is what I have to do”?<br/></b>I watched many films by John Carpenter, Brian de Palma, Sam Peckinpah, but ultimately, all these filmmakers are part of the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/alfred-hitchcock/\">Hitchcock</a> lineage. Hitchcock still remains as one of my biggest inspirations.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Did you catch <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-irishman-2019/\"><i>The Irishman</i></a> yet?<br/></b>I’m dying to see <i>The Irishman</i>. I really cannot wait.</p><p><b>What’s your go-to comfort movie? The one that you’ll always put on, no matter what, and how many times do you think you’ve seen it?<br/></b>I’ve watched <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/psycho/\"><i>Psycho</i></a> more than 50 times.

But Dan and I have been busy, we’re still trucking, we’ve got more movies to make.”</p><p>Premiering at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival—just as his “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/steveholt/film/swiss-army-man/\">arty farty</a>” debut did—<i>The Death of Dick Long</i> is, according to Letterboxd reviews, “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/fletcher_ash/film/the-death-of-dick-long/\">pretty bonkers, surprisingly touching, melancholic, and—in certain aspects—relatable</a>,” with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/maximusrad/film/the-death-of-dick-long/\">“early Coen brothers”</a> vibes in its portrayal of loveable idiots on the run. The best compliment of all for Scheinert? It is “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jeremydburgess/film/the-death-of-dick-long/\">the most Alabama film of all time</a>.”</p><p>“With this one I just wanted people who were colorful and interesting, who had Southern roots, because one of my least favorite things is Hollywood actors faking Southern accents. The cast is like a mix of folks who travelled in and there’s a lot of folks around Birmingham, Alabama where I grew up. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/sarah-baker-1/\">Sarah Baker</a>, who plays Officer Dudley, is a super-talented pedigree actress who travelled in and did all her scenes with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/janelle-cochrane/\">Janelle Cochrane</a>, a local actress who did theater in Birmingham. She plays Sheriff Spenser and that’s just how she acts [in real life].”</p><p>Now that <i>The Death of Dick Long</i> is out in the world, one of Scheinert’s favorite things is to pull out his phone and record audience reactions. “I have ten recordings on my phone of different theaters in different parts of America reacting to this movie because it’s fun.” He argues that laughter isn’t the only fun reaction to get out of an audience: “It’s just as fun to get absolute silence if they’re leaning forward and hanging on every word. It’s really fun to get people whispering or gasping or uncomfortably moving around in their seats, and this movie gets all of it combined. It’s rewarding.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Daniel, it’s time for your life-in-film interrogation. What was the film that made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b><i>Daniel Scheinert:</i> Oh man. It was the show <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jackass-the-movie/\"><i>Jackass</i></a>. I think there’s a whole generation of filmmakers who saw <i>Jackass</i> and were like “you just filmed your friends doing stuff and that’s content?!” My favorite movies look like they were fun to make, which I feel is true of all of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/spike-jonze/\">Spike Jonze</a>’s stuff too.</p><p><b>What’s a bizarre movie that you recommend to everyone?<br/></b>Not to everybody, but this year I’ve been telling people to see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/greener-grass-2019/\"><i>Greener Grass</i></a>, which is a bat-shit crazy movie that a bunch of comedians shot over in Georgia that just is a crazy satire of nuclear families.</p><p><b>Since Hallowe’en is coming up, what’s your favorite scary movie?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/white-chicks/\"><i>White Chicks</i></a>. So scary. I think their white faces are the scariest monsters in movie history. I don’t watch it every Hallowe’en but that’s one of my favorite scary movies.</p><p><b>Which dark comedies and crime movies did you watch in preparation for <i>The Death of Dick Long</i>?<br/></b>I rewatched episodes of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie/\"><i>Breaking Bad</i></a> because I love how information is revealed in that show. It’s fun and colorful and vivid. Billy and I rewatched <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-movie/\"><i>American Movie</i></a>, which is one of our all-time favorites about buddies. That egotistical guy who just wants to make his goddamn movie, wilfully ignorant of the trainwreck of his life, is so relatable. A while ago I made Billy watch <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-celebration/\"><i>The Celebration</i></a> with me, which is… some people would call it a drama, but I think it’s one of the funniest movies ever. It’s a European film about a 60th birthday party going horribly, horribly wrong.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Which film do you think best represents people from the Southern states?<br/></b>I love that question and I was having a hard time coming up with one. Last year I watched <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hale-county-this-morning-this-evening/\"><i>Hale County This Morning, This Evening</i></a>. It’s an arthouse documentary about rural, black, Southern life. I grew up near there and I had never seen the images from that movie [on screen]. Some of them were very familiar but some of them were not.</p><p><b>What’s your go-to comfort movie? The one you re-watch every year, you’re down to watch any time (and how many times do you think you’ve seen it)?<br/></b>It’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind/\"><i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i></a>. I’ve probably seen it start-to-finish like twelve times. I watch pieces of it and listen to the soundtrack all the time. Or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wet-hot-american-summer/\"><i>Wet Hot American Summer</i></a>. Similar number—maybe twelve.</p><p><b>What film do you have fond memories of watching with your parents?<br/></b>That was a fun question. Probably, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/airplane/\">Airplane!</a>.</i> I watched <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jackass-number-two/\"><i>Jackass 2</i></a> with my dad and he laughed so much, it was really fun. He’s a very serious man, until he’s not.</p><p><b>What’s a classic that you just couldn’t get into?<br/></b>Would you call <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/high-fidelity/\"><i>High Fidelity</i></a> a classic? The “guy moping about his ex-girlfriend” genre is just rough for me. Maybe I’ll try it again someday but <i>High Fidelity</i>, man, is tough.</p><p>[Daniel later sent us Billy Chew’s answer: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gone-with-the-wind/\"><i>Gone With the Wind</i></a>. “He hates it. I&rsquo;ve never seen it. But you look back and it’s a super-problematic celebration of the good ol’ days before the Civil War. Fuck that.”]</p><p><b>Do you have a classic that you’re embarrassed to say you haven’t watched?<br/></b>So many. I missed some Martin Scorsese movies. I’ve never seen<i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/raging-bull/\">Raging Bull</a></i>. I know. I was talking about this the other day, I don’t know if I’ve ever seen <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/back-to-the-future-part-ii/\"><i>Back to the Future Part II</i></a> from start-to-finish. I think I’ve seen pieces of it on TV. Dan Kwan is a super-fan. I don’t know if I’ve seen [the first <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/back-to-the-future/\"><i>Back to the Future</i></a>] either. That’s embarrassing. I always wail on time-travel movies and I haven’t even watched these.</p><p><b>Which film was your entry point to foreign-language cinema?<br/></b>I don’t know if Miyazaki counts because they dubbed <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/princess-mononoke/\"><i>Princess Mononoke</i></a> so it’s probably <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/amelie/\"><i>Amélie</i></a>. Actually, as a kid I was obsessed with the black-and-white <a href=\"http://v\"><i>Godzilla</i></a> movies, and I would watch all of them, subtitled. I’d invite my friends over and they would get bored while I would get so excited about that monster smashing those cities.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>What movie scene makes you cry the hardest?<br/></b>It’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/freedom-writers/\"><i>Freedom Writers</i></a>. Anything with inner-city kids expressing themselves just strikes me out, and while that movie is not perfect, once the kids start reading their poems and their stories to the class, I just lost it. Later I found out that Richard LaGravenese, who made that movie, cast real kids and had them tell their real stories, so that’s probably why it hit me so hard. It wasn’t just a screenwriter.</p><p><b>What director do you envy the most?<br/></b>I always talk about this because my answer is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/richard-linklater/\">Richard Linklater</a>. As a kid, I wanted to find a filmmaker who I could look up to. I needed to find one who made multiple good movies because I want a whole career, so that shortened the list. But then also I needed filmmakers who are not assholes and that cut the list way down because you find out all your heroes are assholes. And then I needed to find people who were also good parents, you know? Because so many filmmakers are divorced or don’t see their families, and basically it just [came] down to Richard Linklater.</p><p><b>What’s a film that you wish you had made?<br/></b>Let me think. What’s that movie, I always forget the name, where he’s getting out of the limousine? It’s an arthouse film with, uh. [Daniel starts googling]. It’s French… <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/holy-motors/\"><i>Holy Motors</i></a>! You ever seen <i>Holy Motors</i>? It’s a batshit crazy movie starring Denis Lavant. He’s just the best. It’s just him getting in and out of a limousine and wandering through a bunch of absurdist short films with each one zany in a different way.</p><p><b>What’s the best film of the decade, in your opinion?<br/></b>That’s a tough one. It’s probably <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moonlight-2016/\"><i>Moonlight</i></a>. I love <i>Moonlight</i> so much. For me, it opened up empathy I didn’t know I had. After the third act of that film, I felt I grew as a person. My other answer, I googled it, is not this decade but it came out in the last ten years, is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs/\"><i>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</i></a>. It’s just a perfect film. So I’m a super-fan of <i>Moonlight</i> and <i>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</i>.</p><p><b>A24 is held in incredibly high regard—both in the industry and by the Letterboxd community—for the sheer quality of its output. As a filmmaker, what is the day-to-day experience of being in their camp like?<br/></b>I feel spoiled. Half of my favorite movies I go to see and I go “Oh man, that’s the logo in front of my movie!” I got to meet a handful of the other filmmakers, which I feel so fortunate to have done. They’re such a hands-off company in a really cool way. I just feel like I got to make my movie and they just trusted me. They’re not helicopter parents.</p>"

The nature of that conflict that’s in the shadows is very similar with what’s happening with war today. It doesn’t have those epic front lines that maybe our great-grandparents or grandparents experienced in WWI or WWII. Most operations are done by special forces or drones in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan.</p><p>The idea of creating a film from the backlines is something that speaks to my generation, and creating a mirror to the conflict of adolescence when you’re between a child and being an adult. You want to belong but also be alone, hair comes out of places, your voice changes—and so the film is this exploration of this borderline.</p><p>You’re in the most beautiful place you’ve ever seen, but it’s hell. You don’t know if they’re fighting for left-wing guerilla forces or the right-wing paramilitary force. I wanted to create this allegory where you’re forced to latch onto the humanity and presence of the characters instead of a big ideology. That was very much what drew me into the film.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>When it comes to the back-stories of the characters, and even the time and place where it’s set, you leave a deliberate ambiguity. What motivated that decision?<br/></b>Many times we latch onto first names and last names, ages, dates, names of places, because they make us feel safe. They’re kind of stickers. Like when you fill out a sheet at a job application or at a doctor’s office. But these hard facts can feed into your prejudices. I thought it was interesting because the world is so polarized today.</p><p>You don’t know if Doctora is a CIA operative or an NGO officer. You can’t look at the character through the lens of their occupation, or their last name even. That’s why the characters have a <i>nom de guerre</i> and I think that for me was key for the metaphor to act subversively and kind of just work against any prejudices you might have.</p><p>We always want back-stories to justify and explain actions and a lot of the time it ends up being expository or a filmmaker’s psychoanalysis. Here, I wanted to enforce something very radical which made people feel uncomfortable in war. I wanted you to experience it from the humanity of a group which is basically the lowest rung of the ladder—and many times they are kids.</p><p>As fantastical as it sounds, it’s actually very common. I read a lot of first-hand accounts of people who had been kidnapped by well-known organizations and although the high command had been the one negotiating—be it for political leverage or money—the day-to-day custodianship ended up being the youngest soldiers. The people that were kidnapped experienced being in the hands of kids going through their adolescence and it was a peculiar situation.</p><p><b>The film relies on its ensemble, so you really depended on efficient casting. What do you think it was that pulled these young actors through the brutal challenge to be a part of this film?<br/></b>I think it was the time that we spent together before we even started to shoot. I looked at over 800 kids all over Colombia and ended up bringing that down to about 25. We did a mock training camp and had them do acting improv exercises in the morning. They were doing pieces of the screenplay without knowing they were scenes from the same script. They thought they were random exercises.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>In the afternoon they would do military drills; not classic military boot stomping, but sometimes dancing, barefoot drills, carrying a weapon. We were trying to create this clandestine army and by seeing them live together I was able to see who flirted with who, who fought with who, what chemistries there were, and that way we were able to build the group who would be the final eight.</p><p>During this process of the boot camp we wrote the screenplay, trying to bring the lives of each one of them [into it]. I knew that Boom Boom was a big hip-hop dancer. I knew that Rambo’s most important thing in her life is her brother. Certain things helped the screenplay and the emotional states that the actor would later go into during the shoot.</p><p><b>What were you looking for when recruiting the Doctora role, and why did <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/julianne-nicholson/\">Julianne Nicholson</a> fit the part for you?<br/></b>I thought [Julianne] had this very loveable sweetness to her, and I thought it would be a challenge to take that sensitivity with the maternal instinct that she had with her captors and turn it violent. She was willing to bring that physicality to the screen and she’s got that iconic look to her that reminded me of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/\"><i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i></a>. I thought of the film as a sort of fairytale. I thought the way Julianne was able to portray that switch was something we haven’t seen on screen.</p><p>She was also willing to go down [to Colombia] and make it happen. That was a big thing. She spent time with the kids to really be there for weeks in these incredibly tough conditions. She was willing to go, not just when it was her scenes, but she spent time in [Doctora’s] cell. She drew all the charcoal paintings you see in her room, they were done by hand by her.</p><p><b>Much of the drama depended on your choice of shooting locations. How did you shape the narrative around these limitations and how did shooting in these remote places affect the cast and crew?<br/></b>Shooting 13,000 feet [above sea level], there was really very little oxygen up there. Going down to the jungle canyon where you have to take a donkey, take an off-road, take a raft, take a kayak all the way to reach base-camp. Everyone is at their limit. On the first day of shooting, we had to bring someone down from the camera department who had an epileptic fit. I needed to be carried out of the jungle [due to suspected appendicitis] on the shoulders on these gold miners that were there. They taught us how to live on the river.</p><p>Something the locations gave me that was really special was the narrative arc of the film. That highlands you see in the beginning, it’s a big reservoir of water which is a very delicate ecosystem called páramo. The water trickles down the mountain and gains more speed until it reaches the currents in the lowlands. That path of water was what we were following in the film. The idea of how a river moves in a winding way with different speeds and velocity was what we were trying to echo in the structure of the edit.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Remember too, that once the water reaches the lowlands, it condenses, goes up to the clouds and comes down again in the highlands. So in a way there’s something about the cyclical nature of violence and the circular movement of water that made sense to me. That all sounds great but it’s another thing to make it work in the edit, and we really worked hard so you never thought you were looking from the back of the river—you were always in the river.</p><p><b>The look of the film is remarkable. The clouds, the silhouettes, you have a literal ‘fog of war’. How did you set out to achieve this?<br/></b>The important thing is to look at what was in front of you. My first film was a documentary. I didn’t go to film school so making that film was my film school and a documentary forces you to look at what’s happening in front of you. As much as we had a very detailed screenplay and everything storyboarded, the locations change on a dime so we couldn’t count on luck every day.</p><p>We had to just to be there, be present, and have the confidence to move on, switch and let things come into the page. If a scene was under sun, and then on the day all you get is fog and rain, you discover a new way to come into the scene and let life come onto the page.</p><p><b>Mica Levi [also known as the musician Micachu] has already gained a strong reputation for film composing. How did you manage to wrangle her for <i>Monos</i>?<br/></b>Mica came on board after seeing a rough cut of the film. She connected immediately with it. I didn’t think it needed music but she was on it very quickly. She sent me a very epic whistle that reminded me of spaghetti westerns. The idea was to create something that was minimal but at the same time had that monumental, epic feel.</p><p>We wanted to juxtapose those very primal, basic sounds like blowing into a bottle with a quartet of strings, and later you have sounds that are a shot of adrenaline that sound like they could come out of a Berlin nightclub. That mash of sounds I felt was very important; it allowed you to give emotional cues to the characters, similar to [Sergei Prokofiev’s story-symphony] <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. It was great working with her and my sound designer Javier Umpierrez because we were trying to make this soundscape that was specific but also otherworldly.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b><i>Monos</i> has been submitted for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submissions_to_the_92nd_Academy_Awards_for_Best_International_Feature_Film\">Best International Feature Film at the Oscars</a>. That must feel good.<br/></b>All these prizes help the film get seen and that’s an important thing. This is a film that started on a shoestring and we were trying to build something very radical. It’s a film that was done through absolute blood, sweat and tears of these people who believed in it so I’m just glad that it’s finding its public—and the fact that we’re distributing pretty big in the US for a Latin American film.</p><p>It’s going to open in more than 30 countries and it’s blowing up in the Colombian box office, which is really special because Colombia still hasn’t really seen their cinema. It’s a polarizing topic to have a war film after everything they’ve lived. Having more than 200,000 people go to see it in its first three weeks is a huge thing. For a point of comparison, it’s the same amount of people who went to see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/\">Tarantino’s film</a> [in Colombia].</p><p><b>What film made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b>Wow. That’s your toughest question. I don’t know if I can point to one exactly. When I was young my dad wouldn’t let me watch TV. We had the apparatus but not cable so he had his own movies and I remember he had that German submarine film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/\"><i>Das Boot</i></a>. I watched it so many times I started to see the stitches of how it was made and that got me onto thinking “ah, okay I understand this, I like this”. I’ve never watched it in a movie theater, that would be cool.</p><p><b><i>Das Boot</i> has a similar atmosphere to <i>Monos</i> so it’s an interesting choice for you.<br/></b>Yes, those were the films I was thinking for my second fiction film. I think it comes from that part of time when I watched those epics, including some <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/david-lean/\">David Lean</a> films.</p>"

We knew we wanted to make a film in a single or a limited location because our first film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/body-2015/\">Body</a></i>, which we had at Slamdance in 2015, we shot that entirely in one location and it was a shoestring budget, $50,000. We shot it in eleven overnights. It was really kind of insane, but we came away from that realizing that if you own a location, you can leave your gear up, get in, shoot your day, get out, come back the next morning, turn your lights on and keep shooting.</p><p><i>Robert Olsen (co-writer/director):</i> And that’s a big realm that you can fit a lot of different ideas under. We were wanting to do a kind of “lovers on the run”; a couple of amateur criminals, like in the style of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bonnie-and-clyde/\">Bonnie and Clyde</a> </i>or <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/badlands/\">Badlands</a>. </i>We had been circling that for a while and then it kind of became like, okay, well, if it is this young couple, this inept Bonnie and Clyde, what do they run into in this single location of ours? And that’s where George and Gloria came from. What if it was this bizarro, older version of themselves? Because you look at those different movies and the couples are treated differently, morally, in different ones. Like in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/true-romance/\">True Romance</a></i>, you’re very much sympathizing with them throughout, whereas <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/natural-born-killers/\">Natural Born Killers</a></i>, they get to a certain point where you’re like: oh my god, these people have problems, it’s not good. And so we were like, well, what if Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek didn’t stop at the end of <i>  <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/badlands/\">Badlands</a></i>   </i>and grew up—what would they be like? And wouldn’t that be funny to see these people run into the evil version of themselves?</p><p><i>DB</i>: Once we had the practical location component and the characters, the thematic framework came next. This idea that was sort of obvious once we laid all the pieces out on the board, of this moral relativism. The idea that if you saw Mickey and Jules on the street, you’d go, like, oh those are the villains right? They just robbed a convenience store. Those people are not good people. And if you saw George and Gloria at the grocery store, you’d go, those are good upstanding citizens, look how nice their hair is. It’s tough really that that’s how we operate. And it’s sort of a “don’t judge a book by its cover” thing.<br/><br/><i>RO:</i> And just like how love plays into it where both couples have a genuine loving relationship. They are truly in love with one another, but it’s like, how much can your love for one another forgive the sins that you commit? And also love as this razor’s edge tightrope that you fall on to one side or the other. Are you going to be on the good side of love which drives you to be empathetic and imagine yourself in somebody else’s shoes? Or are you gonna fall on the bad side of love, which is like, obsession and letting love become a corrupting influence on you. So that was where we wound up and then we just got in there and started writing.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>The film invites comparisons with previous “lovers on the run” movies, especially with Bill’s character being named Mickey (evoking Mickey and Mallory from </b><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/natural-born-killers/\">NBK</a></b></i><b>). Were you hoping that audiences would link these characters to that tradition?<br/></b><i>DB:</i> We certainly didn’t wanna hide from it. We’re not running from the <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bonnie-and-clyde/\">Bonnie and Clyde</a></i> ancestor of this, and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/true-romance/\">True Romance</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/natural-born-killers/\">Natural Born Killers</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/badlands/\">Badlands</a></i> and all that stuff. We’d be delusional if we thought we invented the idea of young lovers. We wouldn’t go so far as to say the entire thing is an homage.</p><p><i>RO:</i> We wanted there to be enough references that we were showing that we didn’t think we were the first people to ever have this idea, and at the same time you don’t want so many references that your movie’s just this clip show.</p><p><b>We hear a lot about the “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/tight-spot/\">contained thriller</a>” as a genre these days. How did you feel your film would set itself apart from all the others?<br/></b><i>DB:</i> I think it’s about the space that you’re in. Something we wanted to do differently here was get a sense of mood. We wanted the basement to feel different from the living room and feel different from the kitchen and feel different from Gloria’s room, so that the movie does not become visually repetitive.</p><p><i>RO: </i>Had our resources been more limited, we might’ve been forced to do a situation where we were looking at white walls the entire time and I really don’t think the film would’ve worked had that been the case because the production design, the set decoration, buttresses this tone so effectively. I would say that if you removed that buttress, the entire tower would fall down. You can’t make this movie that exists in this slightly elevated lane above reality without the backdrops of your scenes; they need to get the memo too that we’re existing in a weird world. The dining room needs to have that fiery orange palm tree wallpaper. The other room needs to be cool blue. You would never design two rooms together like that but George and Gloria do. And it’s a signal, it’s a code to the audience that yes, this is a bit surreal.</p><p><i>DB:</i> You can have a unique tone, but if you don’t establish it until 45 minutes into the movie, then you’ve failed. You need those visual markers to let you know that wallpaper’s just too perfect for this to take place in the exact same reality I live in.</p><p><b>Drug use in films is usually pretty didactic, but you have your protagonists take them in what feels like a non-judgmental manner here.<br/></b><i>RO:</i> That’s how we like to do drugs. Non-judgmentally. [Laughs.]</p><p><i>DB:</i> That was one of the first things we conceived at the script level because it’s so in line with that theme of moral relativism. We’re not sitting here saying eleven year olds should be doing coke, but we wanted to paint a portrait of characters that were levelled and had good intentions and you’d feel comfortable sitting and having lunch with them and talking about their lives, but you also see them doing things that are perceived by most of society as evil.</p><p><i>RO:</i> It’s playing with the idea that you mentioned where normally, that is a signal to an audience member that this person is bad. That’s just not how real life works. There are people who do drugs that are perfectly good people. And yes, if your son is thirteen years old and his friend is trying to get him to do coke, that’s evil in your mind in that relative situation. But it’s not the same thing as murdering somebody. It’s not the same thing as keeping a person chained up in your basement.</p><p><i>DB:</i> It was also a way to compartmentalize these characters, to show that their identities were very multi-faceted, that George could both have done incredibly evil things, but he’s doing all these things because he loves his wife and he actually is a good husband.</p><p>You’re keying into something that was really important to us: it’s so easy, and it’s part of the common language of film, to put a character in a box. You’re either a protagonist or an antagonist. You’re either an evil person or a good person. And it’s a challenge both for us as filmmakers and for an audience when they’re digesting this story, to try to carry both of those things in your head at once. “This is a character that is doing something I morally disagree with but I love them though. What’s going on here? This is making me feel weird.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>It’s interesting to see Bill Skarsgård give such an “all-American” performance here.<br/></b><i>RO:</i> We had this idea in our head of this young Johnny Depp, this River Phoenix, late 80s/early 90s heartthrob that they just don’t make anymore, and we just couldn’t find it. And then here comes Bill. We had seen him in these sort of more genre-based roles and things like that. We’d never seen him be charming like he is in this.</p><p><i>DB: </i>He’s usually the opposite of charming. Like in <i>Castle Rock</i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/it-2017/\">It</a></i>.</p><p><i>RO:</i> As soon as we Skyped with him, we were like. that’s it! He’s got it! He’s like, long and lanky but handsome as the day is long and everything too, he’s the perfect guy.</p><p><i>DB:</i> Bill takes the craft very seriously but he’ll do a [comedy] bit with us for five minutes. He’s very jokey as well. We’re in love with him.<br/><br/><i>RO:</i> And he is so built for it. He has these big eyes. He has this, like, “hot Steve Buscemi” thing going on. I’m sure he and his team discussed this and [thought] ‘you’ve got nothing else like this’. So if it’s bad or whatever, we’ll slip it under the rug, but if it’s good, who knows what this could get you? He shouldn’t just play the boogey-man. There’s a lot more to him.</p><p><i>DB:</i> There’s so much more to him than the scary clown.</p>"

Is the ‘house tuner’ occupation at all based in reality?<br/></b><i>Michael Tyburski:</i> The short answer is no, it’s a fictional profession. The character idea is something that my co-writer Ben Nabors brought to me. Right away, I loved the idea of a practise where someone shows up at your door and offers you a solution to the emotional problems that you’re having.</p><p>A lot of alternative therapies exist in New York City so it didn’t seem so far from reality that people would take someone intellectual, dressed well in a tweed blazer, with professional-looking tools, seriously. I really liked that as a conceit. We tried to base it in real science and looked at sound engineers and acousticians for what tools they would use. We tried to make it exist in a very real New York City; that’s why we have touchstones like the character being profiled in <i>The New Yorker</i>.</p><p><b>How has your research into music theory affected your own domestic space?<br/></b>Actually, I moved, for the first time in ten years—after living on a pretty noisy commercial street—during the course of developing and making this movie. Somehow, during the edit, I made my first apartment move within New York City, to a much quieter street. I also took a cue from the main character, Peter Lucian, because I moved my office below my apartment, in a subterranean space. At least I can control the sound a little bit more now that I’m cut off from the surface level, similar to the way Peter does it in his “fallout shelter”.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>The character Peter Lucian feels like a perfect fit for Peter Sarsgaard. When did you have him in mind?<br/></b>He was my first pick. I knew I wanted him from the beginning when I first started thinking about who would be the perfect house tuner. I feel so lucky to have him and fortunately the script resonated with him right away. He’s someone who’s very musically inclined and he plays a number of musical instruments. I was so gratified that he connected to the part so closely.</p><p>He’s such a chameleon of an actor. He can play a lot of dark roles, but also he has a very scientist-like intellect. I also think he has one of the best voices, it’s very unique and I enjoy hearing him. So for a movie about sound, it kind of seemed fitting that someone with those types of qualities would work for the role.</p><p><b>What was important to you about keeping Peter’s house-tuning technology analog instead of digital?<br/></b>I think he’s just someone who has the philosophy of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it”. Even though his tools are a little more dated, they’re still as effective. They might not be as efficient as digital technology so he’s a little slower, but they still work. There is at least one sound engineer in New York City who we found in our research who measures the sound in rooms, and there’s one thing called a spectrum analyzer that we use in the film that we completely got from this guy’s tool bag.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>The film is carefully crafted and you have Peter obsessing over every inch of New York City. What degree of obsession did you have in the making of the film?<br/></b>I’m pretty obsessive as an individual in general. I like to be very organized and have everything mapped out. We had been developing the screenplay for so many years that I got tired of reading it, so before we made the movie, the first thing I did after Peter came on board was sit down and record the entire script in audio format. I kind of had this radio edit of the movie. That transitioned into a rough animatic of the film that I put into the timeline and I was able to add in location references, tonal reference photos, dialogue in different room tones, and then music.</p><p>Logistics-wise, we only had 21 days to shoot the movie which is very conservative especially because we had a lot of ground to cover, but I just needed to be as efficient as possible, so it was helpful to have that thorough, animatic tool.</p><p>With all the technical departments it was a very close collaboration and I like to be very involved in all details. For the sound design, I wanted to re-record all of the tuning forks, which were kind of an aural motif through the film. When you’re shooting in the elements, you don’t always have the control over the environment, so I hand-recorded each one of the tuning forks myself. We were aiming for that level of precision.</p><p><i></i></p><p><b>We’d like to ask a few questions about your life in film. What was the film that made you want to become a filmmaker?<br/></b>My choice is probably not that unique but when I was 13, maybe a little too young, I got a VHS copy of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pulp-fiction/\"><i>Pulp Fiction</i></a>. That stunned me and took me from A to B. It shook up how I thought contemporary American stories could be told.</p><p><b>Which film do you think is the best love letter to New York?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/annie-hall/\"><i>Annie Hall</i></a>, closely tied with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/midnight-cowboy/\"><i>Midnight Cowboy</i></a>. I suppose I love that era of New York.</p><p><b>Which film has the greatest sound design work of all time?<br/></b>There’s a lot, but one of my favorites is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/playtime/\"><i>Play Time</i></a>.</p><p><b>Nice choice. Greatest production design of all-time too.<br/></b>Yeah, not bad. I used a few frames for my look book.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Which is the most overlooked performance from Peter Sarsgaard?<br/></b>I loved him in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/experimenter/\"><i>Experimenter</i></a>, which I think is an underrated film. More recently too, Errol Morris’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wormwood/\"><i>Wormwood</i></a>. I don’t know how many people went down that rabbit hole because it was long, but I think he was so good in it.</p><p><b>What films did you watch to prepare you for <i>The Sound of Silence</i>?<br/></b>There were three that we were looking at, for a lot of different reasons. We watched Jonathan Glazer’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/birth-2004/\"><i>Birth</i></a> for the mood and that fairytale vibe it has in a mysterious, alternate New York City.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/being-john-malkovich/\"><i>Being John Malkovich</i></a> for its bizarro version of science, and I love the naturalistic quality to that film. And obviously <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-conversation/\"><i>The Conversation</i></a> for its production design and how it follows a man obsessed with sound.</p><p><b>This is a nicely-timed, autumnal, gentle film. What films give you those peaceful <a href=\"https://boxd.it/3Qcs4\">autumn vibes</a>?<br/></b>My favorite is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hannah-and-her-sisters/\"><i>Hannah and Her Sisters</i></a>.</p><p><b>What <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kun/list/the-life-of-the-mind/\">mindfuck </a>movie changed you for life?<br/></b>I’ll have a couple Kubrick on this list, but for this probably <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-clockwork-orange/\"><i>A Clockwork Orange</i></a>.</p><p><b>It’s Halloween next month. What movie do you watch every Halloween?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shining/\"><i>The Shining</i></a>! There’s my next Kubrick.</p><p><b>As a teenager, what film character felt like a total mirror to what you were feeling at the time?<br/></b>One of my favorite coming-of-age films is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/harold-and-maude/\"><i>Harold and Maude</i></a>. I definitely identified with Harold.</p><p><b>What’s your go-to comfort movie? And how many times do you think you’ve seen it?<br/></b>My favorite film of all time, which I promise will be my last Kubrick, is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/barry-lyndon/\"><i>Barry Lyndon</i></a>. I think it’s just a perfect movie and I’ve certainly seen it dozens of times. I think it does everything I want in a movie. I don’t even know what genre to call it because it’s funny, it’s dramatic, it’s an epic. I love the idea of doing a perfect epic movie that covers a lot of ground.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>What film do you have fond memories of watching with your parents?<br/></b>We were a big Chevy Chase household and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/national-lampoons-vacation/\"><i>National Lampoon’s Vacation</i></a> holds up as a fine movie.</p><p><b>What’s a classic you could just not get into?<br/></b>Maybe <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brazil/\"><i>Brazil</i></a>. Admittedly I think I need to rewatch it because I first saw it when I was 14 or 15 and I just didn’t quite get it at the time.</p><p><b>What classic are you embarrassed to say you haven’t seen?<br/></b>Two Kurosawa films; <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rashomon/\"><i>Rashomon</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/seven-samurai/\"><i>Seven Samurai</i></a>. They’re always on my list to brush up and they seem to come up in conversation more and more.</p><p><b>Which movie scene makes you cry the most?<br/></b>Definitely the holiday classic <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/its-a-wonderful-life/\"><i>It’s A Wonderful Life</i></a>.</p><p><b>What film was your entry point into non-English language cinema?<br/></b>That was a good one, I like that question. I remember when I was in my freshman year of high school I was given two VHS copies from someone who knew I was getting into film. One of those films was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/persona/\"><i>Persona</i></a>, but then the other one, which I knew I watched first, was a film called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/woman-in-the-dunes/\"><i>Woman in the Dunes</i></a>.</p><p><b>What filmmaker—living or dead—do you envy the most? If Kubrick, go for living…<br/></b>If it’s Kubrick go for living? Oh my gosh.</p><p><b>I feel like you’re going to say Kubrick.<br/></b>Yeah. Envy is a funny word. Kubrick has an admirable career for the depth of his filmography. You know, like a lot of film nerds I’m a huge Paul Thomas Anderson fan.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>What’s a film that you wish you made?<br/></b>I would love to make a movie about magic but ever since I saw <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-prestige/\"><i>The Prestige</i></a> I think it would be hard to compete with that. That period, that Victorian era of illusion, I don’t know if you can top that.</p><p><b>It’s time for best-of-decade lists. What’s the greatest film of the 2010s?<br/></b>If we went back even further it would be easier. For the last 10 years, I think <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/phantom-thread/\"><i>Phantom Thread</i></a> is pretty great.</p>"

The first runner-up was Noah Baumbach’s <i>Marriage Story</i>, and Bong Joon-ho’s <i>Parasite</i> claimed third spot.</p><p>We were at <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>’s world premiere screening, where the atmosphere was buoyant and the jokes landed just where Waititi intended (for most audience members, but we’ll get to that).</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Considering <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> in the context of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/taika-waititi/\">Waititi’s earlier films</a>, it’s rewarding to see threads that run through his other work all tied together in this. War, and the ordinary people who get stuck in it, is a topic of fascination, from the silly humor juxtaposed against a tense waiting game in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tama-tu/\"><i>Tama Tū</i></a>, his short about a small contingent of the 28th Māori Battalion fighting in Italy in World War Two, to the scene on the beach in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/boy-2010/\"><i>Boy</i></a>, where Boy, his brother and their wayward father Alamein play at “war” with sticks. (The name is no accident: El Alamein in Egypt was the site of the longest WWII campaign fought by New Zealand soldiers, including members of the Māori Battalion. It&rsquo;s telling that Alamein prefers to go by his Crazy Horses gang name, &ldquo;Shogun&rdquo;.). Then there’s the epic finale of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople/\"><i>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</i></a>, which literally involves the New Zealand Army.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Children in sticky situations—usually caused by adults—is another common thread, whether they’ve been <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/two-cars-one-night/\">left to fend for themselves outside a rural pub</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFmbIO_JTH0\">watch that one here</a>), or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople/\">lifted from the city and fostered out to a remote farm</a>, or sent to a Nazi Youth boot camp. These are horror scenarios, but by focusing on the worlds and friendships that children create for themselves in these circumstances, Waititi invites us to see how ridiculous grown-ups are; often more childish than the children they’re supposed to be parenting. That stupid <i>Terminator</i> argument between Ricky Baker and Paula the child welfare officer in <i>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</i>; the “foolish sucka!” scene in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/eagle-vs-shark/\"><i>Eagle vs. Shark</i></a>; the debate over whose turn it is to do the bloody dishes in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/what-we-do-in-the-shadows/\"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a>.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Colonialism and its consequences sit heavily beneath all of Waititi’s work, even <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thor-ragnarok/\"><i>Thor: Ragnarok</i></a>, in its examination of the bloody history of Asgard, the events that precipitate a refugee crisis, and what it means to lose your land, and your people. Absent parents—and the effects of yearning for father figures in particular—are common themes, too. This is true even when a parent is present. Witness Alamein&rsquo;s plea in <i>Boy</i>: “Can you stop calling me ‘dad’? It sounds weird.” And the slow transformation of Sam Neill&rsquo;s &ldquo;man alone&rdquo; <i>Wilderpeople</i> character. </p><p>Waititi said at the <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> premiere that the film is a love letter to solo mothers. This applies off-screen as much as on: his mother introduced him to Christine Leunens’ book <i>Caging Skies</i>, upon which the film is based, and his wife, producer Chelsea Winstanley, who spent many years as a solo mother, <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/187728987113/tiff-2019-bong-joon-ho\">provided inspiration for the imaginary friend storyline</a>. Finally, <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> is also an ode to freedom, especially the freedom of one’s own mind in the face of inappropriate heroes and dangerous ideologies.</p><p>One thing the Letterboxd reviews out of TIFF agree on: the brilliant young actors (Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, Archie Yates as his best friend Yorkie, and Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie as Elsa). “One has to congratulate Waititi for his—once again—great casting. The child actors are a joy to watch,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jessewhite/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Jesse</a>, with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/brock_plezova/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Brock</a> praising McKenzie in particular: “Thomasin McKenzie smashes it again, proving with this, and last year’s underseen masterpiece <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/leave-no-trace/\"><i>Leave No Trace</i></a>, that she is one of the best young actresses working today.”</p><p>What’s more debatable, looking through the reviews, is Waititi’s command of the film’s tonal shifts. &ldquo;This is stupid and smart at the same time and is made with a great big heart,&rdquo; writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ellakemp/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Ella</a>. “Some things happen that are so heartbreaking that it would be difficult to imagine how the film could go back into joke mode a mere two scenes later, but it does, and it works,” observes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/justindecloux/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Justin</a>. This was all a pleasant surprise to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tederick/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Matt</a>, who writes: “I had no idea Waititi was capable of landing such diverse and effective tones while still keeping things (relatively) fun.”</p><p>“Taika’s skill is to masterfully weave humor, sweetness, the absurd and goofiness right alongside weightier issues and tragedy,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jenncouttas/film/jojo-rabbit\">Jennifer</a> elaborates. “He does it with such a deft hand that you might miss how incredibly talented he is. He is my modern day Frank Capra.”</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>However, not everyone was charmed by Waititi’s style. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/keithuhlich/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Keith Uhlich</a> took issue with the way the director “prefers to treat his audience like drooling cretins who need their hands held through every shift in tone, reassured that everything, even in a world off its axis, is going to work out”.</p><p>“Anti-intellectual nonsense,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jessewhite/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Jesse</a>. “Waititi claimed to have made this film in order to remember the horrors of nazi Germany and WWII, instead it joins the ranks of narratives that [revise] history… belittling them from their ideology.”</p><p>This was concerning to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/awilmc/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Awilmc</a>: “I was shocked to read a number of negative reviews that said it glossed over the details of WWII… I mean… it was a satire and told through the perspective of a child who clearly wasn’t aware or, at the very least, did not fully understand the circumstances of the devastation and evil around him… Jojo was after all in every single scene.” Adds <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kurstboy/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Karsten</a>, “If there was a film that truly felt like it needed to happen in 2019, it was <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>.” </p><p>At several points in the film, characters note that, within the horrendous circumstances of war, people &ldquo;did what they could&rdquo;. The same is true of Waititi, from whom nobody expects a straight-up drama. In what other movie would &ldquo;Shitler&rdquo; be portrayed with a shabby German accent by a Jewish-Māori from the South Pacific? </p>"

All the cinephiles, the film geeks! Me, also the cinephile, so I’m very happy with that news, thank you!”</p><p>Choi Woo-shik, who plays Ki Woo, the son in <i>Parasite’s</i> poorer family, described what it’s like to be directed by the acclaimed filmmaker. “This is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/okja/\">my second time</a> working with director Bong. He gives very friendly but subtle, very descriptive direction to actors, so I think that gave us a lot of confidence to act better.”</p><p>His favorite scene to film? “It must be the scene where the whole family’s drinking together in our semi-basement, right before my friend comes from work and gives me the stone. It was really fun working with director Bong and Song Kang-ho as my father. It was perfect.”</p><p><i>‘Parasite’ opens in US cinemas on October 11.</i></p><p><!--figure[2]--><h2><i>How to Build a Girl</i></h2></p><p><b>“That’s someone who’s really enjoying writing.”</b></p><p>Beanie Feldstein, admired for her work in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/booksmart/\"><i>Booksmart</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-bird/\"><i>Lady Bird</i></a>, hit the TIFF red carpet for famed feminist writer Caitlin Moran’s adaptation of her semi-autobiographical novel, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/how-to-build-a-girl/\">How to Build a Girl</a></i>. Feldstein is a riot as Wolverhampton teen Johanna Morrigan, who reinvents herself as “Dolly Wilde”, a rock critic and “lady-sex-pirate”. Feldstein promised Letterboxd that if Moran’s next two books about Morrigan, which have been optioned by the same producing team, are also adapted for the screen, she’s in for the trilogy. “Of course! I mean, she’s my girl! I feel so protective of Johanna and I love her so much.”</p><p>We asked the reigning queen of the coming-of-age genre about the films that she loved, growing up: “I grew up obsessed with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/funny-girl/\"><i>Funny Girl</i></a>. Fanny Brice is my idol! <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bridesmaids/\"><i>Bridesmaids</i></a>, my senior year of high school, was, like, the best movie ever. It was the most memorable theater-going experience of my life.”</p><p><i>How to Build a Girl</i> is Caitlin Moran’s first film screenplay. (Working with her sister, she has previously adapted their family life for the British sitcom <i>Raised by Wolves</i>.) We asked Moran which screenwriters she most admires. “Oh my gosh. Who do I really love? If you read the scripts of Bruce Robinson, who did <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/withnail-i/\"><i>Withnail and I</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/how-to-get-ahead-in-advertising/\"><i>How to Get Ahead in Advertising</i></a>, those scripts read beautifully. All the description is there; he describes the sky looking the color of burnt sugar. That’s someone who’s really enjoying writing and you feel that vivacity come through on the page and in the character of Withnail. I love Bruce Robinson’s scripts.</p><p>“<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/juno/\">Juno</a> </i>was my favorite film of the last ten years. The way that that story was told just made me incredibly happy. I just love Diablo Cody so much. Like, when you read her stuff you feel her heart, sometimes her groin, and her massively exploding soul! So that’s what I’m always looking for. I just want to see things on screen that look real, that someone went ‘I’m going to have to write this or bust’. I hate films that look like someone went, ‘Oh, we’d better make a film that looks like a film’. I want people to have sat down and done a list of things where they’re, like, ‘What would I like to see on screen that I’ve never seen before?’</p><p>“And that’s what we tried to do with <i>How to Build a Girl</i>. I just literally, when I was writing the book, just [had] a list of things that I’d never heard anybody talk about with girls.”</p><p><i>‘How to Build a Girl’ does not yet have a scheduled release date.</i></p><p><!--figure[3]--><h2><i>The Lighthouse</i></h2></p><p><b>“I think the fart jokes work.”</b></p><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/\">The Lighthouse</a></i>, directed by Robert Eggers and co-written with his brother, Max, is a film that the word “bonkers” has been thrown around a lot to describe. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson go head-to-head in the black-and-white, claustrophobic, psychedelic and disarmingly funny psychological horror.</p><p>Max told us: “I came up with the original conceit that, you know, the sort of horror-genre of a lighthouse, I’d never seen done. And then Rob needed a writing partner. Well, actually, he had said to me, ‘Do you mind if I steal this lighthouse idea?’ And I was like, ‘Sure, fine, whatever,’ not knowing where it would land me eventually!”</p><p>Writing as brothers, says Max, involved “a lot of turpentine being drank! That’ll make sense for people who see it later. No, I’m just joking. It was a perfect fit. We trust each other, and I think that’s the big thing about writing teams is you gotta trust each other. And brothers, you know, it’s easy. You’d hope it would be easy. Sometimes it’s not.”</p><p>When we suggested that the brotherly relationship likely influenced a lot of the flatulence comedy in <i>The Lighthouse</i>, Max agreed: “Yeah, again, it’s one of those things where we took risks. Comedy is about that. You’ve gotta be able to be honest and trust yourselves. We didn’t know how it was going to play but, thankfully, I think the fart jokes work.” (When asked at the TIFF Q&amp;A whether those farts were real, Dafoe replied: “Half and half.”)</p><p>Robert, when asked about the film he remembers as inspiring him to think about filmmaking, immediately offered <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars/\">Star Wars</a></i>, particularly because of the <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/a-new-hope-behind-the-scenes\">available behind-the-scenes coverage</a> that aided the “discovery process”. Max couldn’t recall the first film that inspired him into a movie-making career, but “one that reaffirmed my work would be a film by Elem Klemov called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/come-and-see/\"><i>Come and See</i></a>, which is the greatest, one of the best films I’ve ever seen. Amazing film.”</p><p><i>‘The Lighthouse’ opens in US cinemas on October 18.</i></p><p><!--figure[4]--><h2><i>Jojo Rabbit</i></h2></p><p><b>“Adults are ridiculous.”</b></p><p>“To me, Kak was so visceral and real.” That’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jojo-rabbit/\"><i>Jojo Rabbit</i></a> producer Chelsea Winstanley talking about her imaginary childhood friend, for whom her family would set a place at the table and open doors, at her instruction. <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>’s writer-director Taika Waititi is also Winstanley’s husband, so her producing role naturally started early in the process, when they would share stories at home about childhood imaginary friends. Waititi plays the title character’s imaginary confidante: a stupid, vain, petulant and badly-dressed version of Nazi despot Adolf Hitler. It’s a character not found in ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caging-Skies-Novel-Christine-Leunens/dp/1419739085\">Caging Skies</a>’, the Christine Leunens novel from which the film was adapted.</p><p>“We talked a lot, shared stories like that, so I think it’s very clever that he introduced that,” Winstanley explains. “It’s almost like we want to have some kind of heroes in our lives but we don’t know if they’re good or bad. Jojo doesn’t know the actions of adults. We’re just ridiculous. Adults are ridiculous. So it’s a really incredible way to show this kid that [Hitler is] not such a great hero.”</p><p>Winstanley, a director herself, was last at TIFF with the female-directed anthology film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/waru-2017/\"><i>Waru</i></a>, and produced the acclaimed documentary <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/merata-how-mum-decolonised-the-screen/\"><i>Merata: How Mum Decolonised the Screen</i></a>, which was picked up by Ava DuVernay’s Array Releasing and is currently available on Netflix. “It’s amazing how I get messages, emails from people around the world who have watched it, because they can, thanks to Ava DuVernay. She championed this film to get out there. I have a massive girl crush on her.”</p><p>On the topic of inspiring women, Roman Griffin Davis, who has been gaining notice for his title role, praised his acting coach, New Zealand actor Rachel House: “She’s properly amazing. She’s a great actress and she’s very good at teaching acting. She kind of taught me how to act. Apart from my mother as well!” Fun fact: House is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/rachel-house/\">a long-time collaborator</a> of Waititi’s (and voices Gramma Tala in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moana-2016/\"><i>Moana</i></a>).</p><p>At the <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> Q&amp;A, actor Stephen Merchant revealed the inspiration for his Nazi Gestapo officer: “I don’t think it’s going to come as a shock to anyone that I obviously watched <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/raiders-of-the-lost-ark/\">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i>. The great <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/ronald-lacey/\">Ronald Lacey</a> performance as the Nazi Gestapo officer… he’s very scary and terrifying so that to me seemed like a great guide; you can be comic but every so often you just turn on that chill factor.”</p><p>Meanwhile, <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> production designer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/production-design/ra-vincent/\">Ra Vincent</a> told us that the film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/life-is-beautiful/\">Life is Beautiful</a></i>—and the personal interests of filmmaker Sir Peter Jackson—were his key influences for the film’s design. “I’ve had quite a long relationship working with Peter Jackson and being around his interests, which are First World War memorabilia and stories. So I’ve had an opportunity to see how close to people’s hearts these stories are, and how it’s important to protect them.”</p><p>As for the films that made him want to be a filmmaker, Vincent, who began his movie career as a model maker, replied: “I think <i>Star Wars </i>did it to me. And also, oddly enough, Medusa [Ray Harryhausen’s work in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/clash-of-the-titans/\">Clash of the Titans</a></i>], because of the claymation aspect to it. That’s my background.” Vincent is already working with Waititi on his next project, “a very nice little feel-good film about the American Samoa soccer team of 2011. It’s exciting to do a job at the beach!” (Michael Fassbender is <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-fassbender-talks-taika-waititis-next-goal-wins-1239585\">reportedly in talks</a> to play the team’s coach.)</p><p><i>‘Jojo Rabbit’ opens in the US on October 18.</i></p><p><!--figure[5]--><h2>Guns Akimbo</h2></p><p><b>“Life’s too short to work with assholes.”</b></p><p>Daniel Radcliffe hit the red carpet this year for New Zealand director Jason Lei Howden’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/guns-akimbo/\"><i>Guns Akimbo</i></a>, the follow-up to his micro-budget, metal-horror, splatter-fest <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/deathgasm/\"><i>Deathgasm</i></a>. Also starring Samara Weaving and Rhys Darby, <i>Guns Akimbo</i> finds Radcliffe drawn into a live-streamed game in which guns have been bolted to his hands. It’s a far cry from Harry Potter and, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/daniel-radcliffe/by/release/\">looking over his recent output</a>, we couldn’t help but comment that he must be having the time of his life picking roles as far from the boy-wizard as possible.</p><p>“I mean, I’m looking to be happy and live a nice life,” Radcliffe replied. “I’m very fortunate to be in a position where I can really pick and choose what I wanna do. No actor is in that position. That’s such a gift, so I’m very lucky to just get to work on stuff that I love and is maybe, I am told, weird, but I love it. And, yeah, also life’s too short to work with assholes, so I generally love to work with lovely people like Samara and Rhys and Jason. It’s very nice.”</p><p>Getting Radcliffe to name the film that made him want to work in movies is a tricky ask, since he started out so young. “That’s what’s weird about me is that I feel like most actors get into it by becoming a fan of film and then, like, ‘I wanna be an actor,’ whereas I was on film sets already by the time I realized I liked film. And I love film sets. I love being here. I feel like that’s what I fell in love with, was actually the experience of making things on set.” When pushed, he ponied up: “The first films I remember falling in love with are, like, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/toy-story/\">Toy Story</a></i>. Those are the first films that I remember seeing and going, ‘Oh, this is amazing’.”</p><p>Rhys Darby, who plays a down-and-out character named Glenjamin in <i>Guns Akimbo</i>, had been at the premiere of his friend Taika Waititi’s film the night before (Darby played Psycho Sam in Waititi’s <i>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</i>). “There’s nothing like it,” he said of <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>. “He manages every time to cast these fantastically comic-driven, gifted children, and [to] have so much pathos and heart. It was a triumph. I’m just jealous I wasn’t in it!”</p><p>Asked what the film was that made him want to get into the entertainment business, Darby responded: “Wow, that’s a good question. To be honest, I’ve always been a James Bond fan. I grew up watching <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/toy-story/\">the Roger Moore James Bonds</a>, and it was the epic-ness of those 1980s films, which are ridiculous. The Roger Moore ones, there’s a lot of humor in them, there’s gadgets, and there’s these great locations, and I kind of dreamed of the idea of maybe being part of that world. It just seemed so ridiculous that it would never happen to a kid from Pakuranga, but it’s kinda happening!”</p><p>Darby recently <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzOsOe4Hz_L/\">achieved a dream of visiting Bond creator Ian Fleming’s home</a>. “I actually went to Goldeneye! Yeah! Who would have thought that I’d get to go to Ian Fleming’s resort in Jamaica, and sit on his chair, where he wrote these novels? That was really special to me.”</p>"

      "sub_title": "“Does every person have to get to the end and succeed in overturning the evil empire? Life isn’t like that. Life is full of these small, difficult questions that cross our path.” <i>Official Secrets</i> director Gavin Hood on spies, lies and the scoop that made him feel like a journalist.",
      "abstract": "<p>Keira Knightley yelling “It doesn’t make any sense!” at the television news is all of us, these days. The case for the invasion of Iraq, we now know, was based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction. There were many public servants who knew, even then, that the intelligence that was being gathered to make a case for Saddam Hussein’s overthrow was shockingly debatable.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/official-secrets/\"><i>Official Secrets</i></a>, directed by Academy Award-winner Gavin Hood, tells the true story of one such public servant, Katharine Gun, a British intelligence specialist who worked as a Mandarin translator. In 2003, Gun leaked an NSA memo that sought Britain’s help to collect information that could be used to blackmail United Nations Security Council members into voting in favor of an invasion of Iraq.</p><p>As a spy tale, it’s not all cut-and-thrust action, foot-chases and explosions. The tension lies in Knightley’s performance as a furious and concerned Gun, wrestling with the decision to leak the memo, and in <i>The Observer</i> newsroom, where journalists (played by Matt Smith, Matthew Goode and Rhys Ifans) debate whether to publish it. Later, it turns courtroom drama, with Ralph Fiennes at the helm as Gun’s civil rights lawyer.</p><p>Some of the story’s details—as they often are in biopics—have been massaged for the big screen. In particular, a spell-check disaster by a young journalist on <i>The Observer</i>’s foreign desk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/27/international-incident-work-mistake-official-secrets-film\">is played out in front of a larger audience</a>.

      "body": "<p>Keira Knightley yelling “It doesn’t make any sense!” at the television news is all of us, these days. The case for the invasion of Iraq, we now know, was based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction. There were many public servants who knew, even then, that the intelligence that was being gathered to make a case for Saddam Hussein’s overthrow was shockingly debatable.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/official-secrets/\"><i>Official Secrets</i></a>, directed by Academy Award-winner Gavin Hood, tells the true story of one such public servant, Katharine Gun, a British intelligence specialist who worked as a Mandarin translator. In 2003, Gun leaked an NSA memo that sought Britain’s help to collect information that could be used to blackmail United Nations Security Council members into voting in favor of an invasion of Iraq.</p><p>As a spy tale, it’s not all cut-and-thrust action, foot-chases and explosions. The tension lies in Knightley’s performance as a furious and concerned Gun, wrestling with the decision to leak the memo, and in <i>The Observer</i> newsroom, where journalists (played by Matt Smith, Matthew Goode and Rhys Ifans) debate whether to publish it. Later, it turns courtroom drama, with Ralph Fiennes at the helm as Gun’s civil rights lawyer.</p><p>Some of the story’s details—as they often are in biopics—have been massaged for the big screen.

What compels this reflection on recent history?<br/></b><i>Gavin Hood:</i> I’d like to give you an easy answer but part of it is that you struggle to get the film made—it’s been three years since we first started working on it. So, in some ways the timing felt right when I first heard about Katharine Gun, and then you think ‘oh my goodness, is the landscape going to change? Is politics going to change?’ and of course it hasn’t. If anything it feels more timely in this strange post-truth world.</p><p>It might sound odd to say that, but at the time [US president George W.] Bush and [UK prime minister Tony] Blair were spinning their lies for what they genuinely believed was some higher purpose. I think they at least would have felt a certain shame in being caught out in a lie. Certainly [former US National Security Advisor] Colin Powell did when he discovered that everything he said at the UN was a lie. He described that it was the low point of his career and he’s devastated by it and he’s apologized.</p><p>In the world that we live in now I don’t think certain politicians even care if they get caught out in a lie. What is truth? It doesn’t really matter what’s true. Say what you want to say.</p><p>What I liked about the story was the rather simple idea that truth matters, and certainly being true to my own conscience matters because what else are we in a democracy but a bunch of individuals? You have to make up your own minds and act on what you believe to be the truth.</p><p>That’s an easy thing to say but not always an easy thing to do. I like the fact that Katharine Gun was not some larger-than-life political figure, she was very ordinary in many ways. She’s quite like you and me when you meet her.</p><p>Katharine is not someone who seeks the limelight. She didn’t ever really think she’d be known around the world, and even now she tends to shy away from it. But what she had was a moment where something came across her desk at her place of work that she just felt was wrong and her conscience couldn’t live with it. That’s something that’s quite simple.</p><p><b>You had to build suspense from these small actions with most of the dramatic implications offscreen. How do you ensure a dialogue-driven film like this has the weight you need it to have to make its impact?<br/></b>The challenges you’re suggesting did give me pause. She doesn’t ever—as one studio executive said to me—“when does she ‘don her cape’ as the hero?” Are we really in this ‘don the cape’ world where every story has to be about someone saving the world or otherwise it doesn’t count? Does every person have to get to the end and succeed in overturning the evil empire? Life isn’t like that. Life is full of these small, difficult questions that cross our path. We make moral and ethical decisions of big and small kinds every day and that’s what gives us our life.</p><p>This isn’t a story about a person who changed the world, it’s a story about personal conscience and those little moments that suddenly, in her case, turned into a huge story. When it came out in <i>The Observer</i> newspaper, it was a big story, but what was sad about it was—and please excuse my choice of words—what trumped it 24 hours later was a bigger story.</p><p>What was that story? It was the story of us invading Baghdad. All of a sudden the news media—quite understandably from a purely commercially journalistic point of view—is not looking at how we got into the war because what do we want to see? Video footage of the bombing of Baghdad. Everyone was glued to that, and then it was about the embedded journalists with the troops and the almost Hollywood movie stories.</p><p>How we got there, the reasons for it, and whether we were lied to, took ages to come around again after they didn’t find the ‘weapons of mass destruction’ that they suggested [were] the reason they had to go in. As you know, the reason they had to come up with the ‘weapons of mass destruction’ argument was because they needed a legal reason to go in.</p><p>Under international law there are only two ways you can legally justify invading another country; one is that you have a UN resolution and we all go in together to stop a genocide—which is what they were hoping to get—but Katharine’s leak thwarted the plan because these non-permanent members refused to vote after it was discovered they’d been spied on. They never got that UN resolution which would have given them perfect cover.</p><p>They had to rely on the second legal justification for war in international law, which is self-defense and that was that they had to show that [Saddam Hussein] is a genuine threat to all of our safety. “He&rsquo;s so bad that he could launch chemical weapons on London in 45 minutes” was the Blair claim, and it turned out to be absolute nonsense.</p><p>The desire for a regime change and the belief that they would create a lovely, flowering democracy in the Middle East was their, I think, naïve agenda, but it allowed them to lie to us and then they got caught in the lie. Katharine is an ordinary person who’s part of the story of how those lies came about.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Since this is recent history, you had the opportunity to talk extensively with many of the film’s subjects. What values did those discussions have that you could not get from the source book, <i>The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War?<br/></i></b>The book mostly focused on Katharine’s journey and the politics around the time. After I read the book I asked if I could meet Katharine Gun myself, and [producer] Ged Doherty flew me to London. I spent five days with Katharine and some interesting things came up in our conversations that I hadn’t found in the book.</p><p>I did the same with Martin Bright [journalist at <i>The Observer</i>, portrayed by Matt Smith] who was not covered extensively in the book. I got a great deal of information from him. He referred me to the other journalists, Peter Beaumont [portrayed by Matthew Goode] and Ed Vulliamy [portrayed by Rhys Ifans], who told me a great bit about their sources, and then I went to speak to Ben Emmerson [Katharine’s lawyer, portrayed by Ralph Fiennes] and with him I got the most significant information that was not in the book.</p><p>I’ll give you two examples. First of all, he very carefully described how he came up with the defense of necessity that he used. He was going to call for these documents that he knew would show that the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had consistently said for over a year that war without a UN resolution would be illegal under international law.</p><p>Three days before the war, Goldsmith changed his mind and came up with a bizarre idea that the 1991 Gulf War, which had been authorized by a UN resolution, had never really ended and so they could still use that. It was such a crazy fringe idea because we hadn’t won that war and the motion of that war was nonsense in the end.</p><p>I said to Ben, “How did you know when you called for those documents that you’d get what you needed? How could you be so sure that Goldsmith said what he said?” There was this pause, then he said to me, “Well you know [his Deputy Attorney General] Elizabeth Wilmshurst has resigned, right?” I did know that, but she never said why.</p><p>Well, he called Elizabeth and asked if he could come round and have a cup of tea with her. I said, “Wow, that’s never been in the press.” I ran back to Martin and told him how Ben told me the contents of the conversation that he had with her, which is depicted in the movie [Wilmshurst is portrayed by Tamsin Greig] and I asked him if he knew about this. He said, “Gavin, you’ve got a scoop!” and I replied, “Jesus, I feel like a journalist!” I’ve never made a movie where the people are still alive. I normally make up fictional people, but journalists do this every day.</p><p>The other example was that Ben told me about the conversations he had with the director of public prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald, who’s a member of the House of Lords. If you’re in America, that’s like saying a senior senator is involved. Ben told me that they both had beach houses in Norfolk and they have known each other for many years, and Macdonald arrived unannounced at Ben’s home and started chatting to him about the case. It was very uncomfortable, and Ben said how it’s not appropriate and they can’t be talking about this.</p><p>At the coda [of the movie], Macdonald comes to Ben and says, “It wasn’t me who chose to prosecute,” and this interaction actually happened. I discovered with a bit more research that the director of public prosecutions in England has great autonomy to decide who to prosecute and who not to prosecute without any influence from any member of the government, except in cases involving the Official Secrets Act. It turns out that in order to prosecute, the director of public prosecutions must get the permission of the Attorney General.</p><p>That means Ken Macdonald must have asked Lord Goldsmith to get his permission to prosecute Katharine Gun, which was obviously given because they charged her. And then they must have said, “Lord Goldsmith, they’re asking for your documents, what do we do?” So, what we don’t know from a journalistic point of view is why did they drop that case? Our film ends with the case being dropped. Was it because Lord Goldsmith got a fright and didn’t want to show his documents?</p><p>I think it’s highly likely, because it took until 2010 when those documents were finally released to the public and showed exactly what they [had] suspected and what Wilmshurst said they would show. There’s an opportunity for a scoop here; for a journalist to go press Lord Goldsmith on this case. I think some have tried and he gives no comment. But what is the truth?</p><p>What is interesting is that although Katharine and Ben were relieved that she wasn’t going to prison, they actually felt they had a strong defense. Both of them to this day feel they never got their day in court, when they actually wanted their day in court. That is why Ben jumped up as the prosecutor was dropping the case and said, “Surely my client is entitled to know why, indeed the public is entitled to know why this case is being dropped.” He said to me he just had to get that on the record because they were shutting them down.</p><p>So this is an interesting thing, because as a piece of normal narrative filmmaking it just won’t fit into the box of ‘the hero is wronged, they go about overcoming the antagonist and set the world right’. Real life is seldom like that, and so the question became ‘is the real-life story still worth telling?’ and I think yes because the story isn’t over and we’re just a tiny part of an ongoing understanding of that war.</p><p>Martin Bright has said it’s both a film—because it’s performed by actors—but it’s also in some way a piece of journalism. I hope that we’ve discovered things that weren’t in the book, to answer your question. Maybe someone will pick up [where we left off]. I think that when it comes out in Britain, more so than America, where it’s far more personal to the British, there’s some significant questions Lord Macdonald could be approached [about] and asked why he really dropped that case.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Katharine yelling at the news on TV was refreshing; a reminder of how frustrating it was in 2003. Things remain complex in world politics. What’s your advice for staying invested in politics while not getting exhausted?<br/></b>We are exhausted, and the danger of us being exhausted with the seemingly endless bitterness between both sides of our democracy—certainly here in America—and the flagrant disregard for truth by our current president, it’s easy to become jaded and give up. The problem with authoritarianism is that it relies on people giving up.</p><p>I grew up in apartheid South Africa in the ’70s and ’80s. I know what it’s like to watch a country get worse and worse in terms of its security legislation, especially in the ’80s with the state of emergency that literally had laws saying “you can be detained without trial indefinitely, without a right of access to a lawyer”. That’s how bad it got. It’s almost inconceivable to most people.</p><p>It’s very easy to get exhausted, stop focusing on our world, and stop voting. I think our greatest obligation is to do our little part. We don’t think it’s a big part, but if each of us plays our part that’s the only way our democracy works. The minute we’ve become exhausted, we’ve given up on the only system that works. Democracy is messy but it works in our favor as citizens. When we give up on it, we give way to tyranny. It sounds dramatic but I think it’s true.</p><p>I think we have to accept the frustration. We have to say “yes, it’s frustrating, it’s never suddenly going to be fine, it’s always going to be messy and require debate”. We have to embrace the messiness of it all and not give up and say “I have to do my job—I don’t have to be politically active every day, but I do have to be a good citizen, apply my mind to what’s out there, and vote”. That’s the only way our democracy survives.</p><p>There’s something interesting about what the Australians do in their voting system. They don’t actually say “you have to vote” but they do say every citizen has to go to the polls. Some people interpret that as everyone has to vote, but in fact you can abstain at the polls. You have to mark across the line that says “I don’t vote for anyone on this list”. At least for a moment every citizen is compelled to make a statement about what they think.</p><p><b>Lastly, what film made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b>I grew up very disconnected in South Africa. I never saw a TV set because there were none in the country until 1976. It was part of the government’s desire to not allow the outside world in. What I used to do with my parents was rent movies on 16mm, projected onto a sheet hanging in the living room. For me, every movie I saw was fascinating because it gave me a glimpse into the world overseas, but they were always about the people from overseas.</p><p>One day when I was about ten years old, I went to the cinema with my friend to watch a little South African movie called <i>E’ Lollipop</i> [also known as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/forever-young-forever-free/\"><i>Forever Young, Forever Free</i></a>, released in 1975], about a little white boy and a little Zulu boy who are friends. I remember being white-knuckle glued to my seat. It wasn’t because it was a thriller, it was because it was a story where people spoke with my accent and were telling a story about where I came from.</p><p>I’d never seen anything like it and it spoke to me. “Oh wow, films can be made about us— I can make a film about anything!” It doesn’t just have to be about something that people from overseas do. And I think that’s when the bug bit. I haven’t told that very often, thank you for asking.</p>"

Laurence Fishburne, Judy Greer and Kristen Wiig also star.</p><p>Directed by American filmmaking icon (and co-founder of the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/afs/\">Austin Film Society</a>) Richard Linklater, the screenplay was co-written with his frequent collaborators (and married couple) Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. If their names are not familiar as scriptwriters, that’s because they usually work further behind the scenes for Linklater, and have been since 1993’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dazed-and-confused/\"><i>Dazed and Confused</i></a>, when Holly was a production coordinator, and Vince a second second assistant director.</p><p>Vince became Linklater’s first AD for the films <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bad-news-bears/\">Bad News Bears</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fast-food-nation/\">Fast Food Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-scanner-darkly/\">A Scanner Darkly</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/before-midnight/\">Before Midnight</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/boyhood/\">Boyhood</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/last-flag-flying/\">Last Flag Flying</a></i> and <i>Where’d You Go, Bernadette?</i>. Holly co-produced Linklater’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/me-and-orson-welles/\">Me and Orson Welles</a></i> (2008), which she also wrote with Vince.</p><p>Reviewing <i>Where’d You Go, Bernadette?</i> on Letterboxd, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mrtomtron/film/whered-you-go-bernadette/\">Tom</a> suggests that after a “generic” opening, the film “slowly starts to show its true colors as the character of Bernadette is unwrapped… it’s a story that is touching and even a bit inspiring for those who aspire to be their own artist in life.” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/criterionsn34/film/whered-you-go-bernadette/\">J Oled</a> agrees: “This could’ve been a Hallmark special, but because Linklater generally loves humanity, and is always experimenting, this film is quite watchable, it’s warm, relatable, and modest, and I wasn’t asking for much else.” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/melissagillum/film/whered-you-go-bernadette/\">Melissa</a>, who has read the novel, offers: “If you’re a fan of the book… the movie is starkly different. But if you’re a fan of Linklater… you’re going to love it. Cate Blanchett may be the best actor of the decade.”</p><p>We spoke to Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. about their collaborative writing process with Linklater, mining their own relationship for inspiration, and making films for the social-media age.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>How you were brought onto the project?<br/></b><i>Holly Gent Palmo:</i> We have worked with Rick [Linklater] for many years. We first met on <i>Dazed and Confused</i>, where we were on the crew, and we’ve worked on many projects with him. He’s one of our close friends. He was brought onto the project and then we read the book and loved it so he brought us on. We started from scratch, it was all based on the novel.</p><p><b>What did you relate to in the book that made you feel you had the right perspective to take it on?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> This is a movie that for me personally is very relatable because it’s about a woman who has really lost herself in motherhood and as much as she loves that journey, she’s also really looking to rediscover her passion of her past creative impulses. I think that’s something that Rick, Vince, and I all can relate to, not only as parents, but also as people trying to do something creative in this world.</p><p><b>Was the book’s author Maria Semple involved at all?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> First of all, the novel is fantastic.</p><p><i>Vincent Palmo Jr:</i> Love the book, love the book.</p><p><i>HGP:</i> Maria knows so much about the filmmaking process and has that history herself that she knew that she wanted to hand it off to Rick. She talked to Cate and she talked to Rick but she did not take part in the writing.</p><p><b>Richard Linklater seems like a great writer to collaborate with. What is it about him that makes that operate so well?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> With Rick, the way we work is that we talk a lot in the beginning and clearly discuss every aspect of the book. This one was particularly challenging in that it was a modern epistolary novel told in emails and transcripts. It’s not a straight narrative and it’s not told in a linear fashion, necessarily. So we had to sort out the chronology of our story and what would be included.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>It’s the way he works with actors and everyone. It’s a really respectful, really collaborative process where everybody gets to bring to the table their own personal point of view in their own lives. With Rick, we dove into the parts of the novel we liked best and what threads we were going to pick up and carry through.</p><p><i>VP:</i> It was a pretty deep exploration of the novel, of all the different characters and situations. We talked through all that and came to an agreement between the three of us for what we felt said the themes best.</p><p><b>Vincent, you’re also Linklater’s first assistant director, which is an interesting combination of multi-tasking. On set, would you pitch in on the script-side?<br/></b><i>VP:</i> No, on set as a first AD I’m more concerned about the day’s work and really having everything in place and ready to go so Rick just has to say “action” and “cut”. I don’t talk at all about the script. At that point we’re all dialed in anyway.</p><p>When Holly’s around they have their conferences and I’ll be arranging the next set up. I’ve done a lot of things with Rick. I did all twelve years of <i>Boyhood</i>. There’s a shorthand there that I’m intent and focused on each day’s shoot and what’s coming up the next day.</p><p><i>HGP:</i> By the time Rick gets to set, he’s totally prepared and ready. He has his rehearsal process with his actors. Our process is over, he’s very sure of what he wants.</p><p><i>VP:</i> You can’t over-prepare, but we’re very prepared.</p><p><i>HGP:</i> Except maybe in a rare instance in having to negotiate some small change.</p><p><i>VP:</i> Yeah, like in what the weather’s brought or something new at a location, things like that.</p><p><b><i>Boyhood</i> and <i>Before Midnight</i> are both classics of their decade now. What were those sets like?<br/></b><i>VP:</i> I’m so happy for Rick [that they’re highly regarded]. <i>Boyhood</i> just stretched on. I remember there were times where we were like, “is somebody in Eastern Europe doing the same thing and it’s going to come out before us?!” We really didn’t know.</p><p>To pick it up each year and shoot it on film when all that kind of change [to digital] was in the midst of us shooting… Any time I’m on a set with Rick I feel very fortunate. To see them received in the way they were, it’s really thrilling.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>In what ways, if any, did you adapt your style to the talents of Cate Blanchett and the other cast members?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> We knew that Cate was interested from the moment that we began. We were always hoping to do justice to her great talent and thinking towards that. To me, there could be no-one better in that role. Cate brings so much to it.</p><p>It’s an inspiration to think that no matter what kind of nuanced emotion we write in a scene, she can carry it and do an incredible job. It gives a freedom of inspiration thinking that there’s a possibility that Cate Blanchett can be playing the part.</p><p><b>The book is largely renowned for the way it captures the nuances of Seattle. What types of research did you do for the characters’ occupations and their environments?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> Rick did a lot of interesting, in-depth research for Elgie’s technology role and the kind of things he was developing. He talked to a lot of people involved in Microsoft developing those sorts of things, to bring that in the most detailed and up-to-date way.</p><p>For architecture, Rick arranged some meetings with some really great architects to go and talk to them about the language they use. As far as Seattle goes, there’s no greater resource for that than the novel itself. Maria really knows that world and has so many funny and interesting outsider opinions about it that I felt it was the perfect way to learn about that.</p><p><b>What did you feel you could bring to the element of marriage when writing as a married couple?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> That’s interesting.</p><p><i>VP:</i> That is interesting. Well, we’ve been married for 26 years. </p><p><i>HGP:</i> I do think that all three of us brought in our past relationships and our current relationships to the process. I believe it’s a realistic portrayal of the quest to keep improving your life through self-discovery. It’s a unique story that you don’t really see a lot of.</p><p>That whole idea that you can’t ever really know anyone, but that doesn’t mean you can’t try—Rick really loved those words, they’re the opening words of the novel. It’s this idea that the other person is always somewhat unknowable, but you keep trying to get to know each other while you change through the years.</p><p><i>VP:</i> The search continues! You find new things.</p><p><i>HGP:</i> Nothing is more rewarding in life than those close relationships that last decades.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>Do you think it’s difficult to write contemporary films for the social-media age?<br/></b><i>HGP:</i> It’s fascinating when you see movies and there’s this before-and-after cell phones dividing line, because so many of the great films and their plots would have been so different if everyone was carrying a phone around.</p><p>I don’t know if it’s easier, but it is a change in your way of thinking as you realize everyone has a phone in their pocket. I think both [period and contemporary] are fun. Any kind of story or plot that you’re trying to figure out is a really fun and challenging puzzle. I notice in a lot of films they try and get rid of the phone in some way.</p><p><b>What was the film that got you into filmmaking and made you want to be a part of this industry?<br/></b><i>VP:</i> Oh my gosh, wow. Jeez, that’s a really tough one.</p><p><i>HGP:</i> There’s so many stages to it. There’s the ones you see when you’re a little kid that just blow you over. Those are so bound with light and emotion that you don’t even understand. I remember <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/apocalypse-now/\"><i>Apocalypse Now</i></a>—that was something that blew my mind.</p><p><i>VP:</i> It just kind of builds. I got a degree in journalism and then I ended up working in film so it’s hard to point to just one that really flipped the switch. I don’t know why, but I saw <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-sound-of-music/\"><i>The Sound of Music</i></a> a bunch of times when I was younger. Maybe it was just easier for my mom to take me and my four siblings out to see it.</p>"

She said, “You’re going to be a little scared while you’re reading this because I think you’re going to relate to the character and then you gotta keep reading because the script is really beautiful and powerful.” I read it and I remember thinking the exact same thoughts: ‘This is going to be very different to take on than most things I’ve done’. It was different in a good way. Something I wanted to try and go out of my comfort zone. I just related to the characters so whole-heartedly. There were moments where I thought ‘someone is taping me right now’ because I’ve thought the exact things and now they’re in a script I’m reading.</p><p><b>What were some of the conversations you had with the real Brittany? How did meeting her affect your approach?<br/></b>The script is inspired by her story but there were a lot of other characters in the film that were not in her actual life story. Paul and I decided to create a character together and Paul had sent me early on a video of the real Brittany when she was making a tape to raise money for the marathon. I completely got her essence from that. She is so inspiring, smart, and funny, sometimes very silly.</p><p>Paul and I worked together on creating a character based off all these other characters and it informed us about X, Y and Z. But the first time I met the real Brittany O’Neal was when we were shooting a super emotional scene. I was concerned about making sure she was okay. It’s one thing to know that your life story was about to be told; it’s another thing to see an actor trying to portray all of these things you really went through in your real life.</p><p><b>What were the other types of preparations you did for the role?<br/></b>I decided I was going to do the actual physical journey of the character. I decided to lose 40 pounds for the shoot, 29 pounds before we shot and eleven while we were filming. I just thought it would inform me on certain approaches the script took that I didn’t quite connect to emotionally. There was so much that I did connect to with Brittany, and then there were moments in certain scenes where I thought ‘why is she acting that way? Why is that her response?’ Once I had done the physical journey I completely understood. I had never experienced what it was like to plateau, for example, and focus on a number so intensely. That was part of the script that I didn’t really understand.</p><p><b>You’re known more as a comedic actress and this was a fantastic opportunity to show off your dramatic talent. How did you want to subvert expectations of yourself coming into the more dramatic scenes?<br/></b>I think there’s always a lot of pressure when you try something that is different than people expect to see when they come to see a movie that you’re in. I was just so drawn to the script and I wanted to protect the character. I know I told Paul that I didn’t want anyone else playing her, not that anyone else couldn’t do it, but I wanted to make sure that the way I read it was the way he was going to shoot it, and he was so on the same page.</p><p>I felt like I was in really good hands. We were both taking a chance on each other. He was a first-time writer/director and this was my first time doing something that had dramatic elements, and I was playing the title character which I’d never done before. This is the first time where I was in a movie where I was in every single scene. I had no idea if I was going to enjoy doing something that was such a departure of things I had done in the past, but I truly loved it and I hope I get to do it again.</p><p><b>There’s a fine balance between the need for people to live healthily in order to avoid lifestyle-related illnesses, versus the need for society to accept everyone for who they are, no matter their appearance. What conversations did you, Paul, and other creatives have about this line?<br/></b>We had several conversations and talked basically every day for seven months before we started shooting. We wanted to make sure that we were being honest about these conversations: what it’s like going to the doctor and have them say to you: “You need to lose weight to be healthier” because of some health concerns; and the difference between that and the friendship that you have where somebody is saying: “You’d look better if you drop a few pounds” and how unhealthy that is. And how you can have self-hate and lack of self-worth and [how some of that] is society-ingrained ideas and some of that is of your own making. I think Paul did such a beautiful job with the script. We hit on everything without being too political or too shy.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/186488848958/trustworthy-lynn-shelton\">We just covered <i>Sword of Trust</i> </a>and had the delight of chatting with its director, Lynn Shelton. That’s another fantastic, funny movie you’re in. Can you talk about the different pleasures you get from working from a script versus the type of freedom you have in improvisation, as you did on <i>Sword of Trust</i>?<br/></b>I’m definitely more comfortable with things like Lynn’s film, where it’s not as scripted and you get to be extremely loose and bring whatever you want to it, and Lynn was so open to any ideas we had. I remember <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/michaela-watkins/\">Michaela</a> and I, the night before we shot, we were sitting in a hotel room together talking over who our characters were and what they wanted, what their goals were. We approached Lynn saying “this is what we’re thinking” and she said “great!”. It’s very different from doing a role like Brittany, where all I got was the script and I fell in love with that. I decided to stick more to the script than I’ve done with any other film. But I definitely wanted to make sure I was telling the story that I received and was so moved by.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>It’s awesome that in both these movies you’re opposite Michaela Watkins.<br/></b>It’s wonderful for me. Michaela Watkins is one of my favorite actresses. I just think she’s so strong, and honest in her performances, and she also makes me laugh harder than most people in this world. I would really love to work with her again. I’ve worked with her twice in one year so I’ve felt very lucky.</p><p><b>Paul Thomas Anderson has said he’s gearing up for a comedy with Tiffany Haddish. He brought you onto <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-master-2012/\"><i>The Master</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/inherent-vice/\"><i>Inherent Vice</i></a> because he thinks you’re very funny. You must be on his speed-dial for this project, right?<br/></b>I don’t know about that. [Laughs]. I may not be on speed-dial. I’m definitely a huge fan of his and I love that him and Tiffany are working together. That’s going to be amazing. If I hear nothing more than it coming out, I’ll be very excited to go see it.</p><p><b>Brittany has a life-changing experience and your hard work to demonstrate that really shows. How has working on the film changed your life?<br/></b>It has changed my life. It’s changed the way I look at myself, the way I speak about myself or even think about myself. I feel like I’m a much kinder person to me. It made me examine what I was putting out there and how negative that can be and I think that happens, not to all women but to some, and I’m definitely one of those women.</p><p>I feel like a movie like this really inspired me to look at that and have a deeper look at how I would talk about myself. I think this is the movie that I wanted to see when I was thirteen, about a real woman who was struggling with these things and how hard it can be to make the first step, how amazing it can be to really choose yourself first over everyone. It’s a hard thing to do, making that first step.</p><p><b>What was the film that made you want to be in film?<br/></b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/clue/\"><i>Clue</i></a> was the movie that made me want to be in films. I watched that when I was a young girl; it was one of the first VHS tapes we had and I watched it on repeat. It wasn’t just because I loved comedy and mystery and anything that’s a little dark and twisted; I also loved how all these funny character actors were the leads. I still love watching that movie and it’s still my favorite movie to this day.</p><p><!--figure[3]--><h2>Paul Downs Colaizzo (writer/director)</h2></p><p><b>The film is based on your best friend and roommate Brittany. What was the moment you realized her story could be a movie, and how was she involved in shaping her own narrative and the tone of the film, if at all?<br/></b><i>Paul Downs Colaizzo:</i> It was after a conversation she and I had after I first moved in with her, where she decided she was going to turn her life around and take control of what she could control and find some structure in her life. So she went for a run. It was when she was out for her first run that I thought this could possibly be a movie. I outlined it without telling her I was working on a movie that was inspired by her life and then a few months later I let her know. She was surprised and flattered and excited and interested and intrigued.</p><p>The character of Brittany is different than my real-life friend Brittany in a lot of ways but her DNA is all over it. She was incredibly supportive, and now she’s at a point where she’s excited that people are going to be inspired by something that was inspired by her.</p><p><b>Which aspects were fictionalized for the movie?<br/></b>I took some milestones from her journey and there were elements of her personality that I incorporated into the character of Brittany, but none of the characters is really based on anybody. The character Brittany is different from my friend and really none of the scenes from the movie is a recreation of anything that happened in real life.</p><p><b>What was it that convinced you Jillian was right for the lead? How did you identify the dramatic potential of the comedic actors you selected?<br/></b>[With] Jillian, I’d always been a fan of her comedy and her comedic acting; when she was in<i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/22-jump-street/\">22 Jump Street</a></i> I fell in love with her. When I met with her about the role she really had this connection to the character. She wanted to tell the story and she wanted to protect the character in the way that I did. Her brain is naturally funny so we got the opportunity to play with the comic genius that is Jillian Bell and also expose this well of untapped emotion that most people had never seen her access. She’s never done a dramatic role before, I had never directed a film. We had to place bets on each other. That drove both of us to work as hard as possible to not let the other one down. </p><p>The idea of the film is that we’d take a character who is typically a sidekick, start with the archetype of her as someone we know how to laugh at and create actually a really deep, personal pathos-filled human that we also empathize with and relate to. We wanted to do that with Brittany but also with all the other characters in the film. Luckily we got incredibly talented comedic actors who are normally playing supporting roles and also have these other elements of their personality that we were able to expose and illuminate for the world to see.</p><p><b>Do you feel there are films or plays that have done justice to body image issues before? What did you want to bring to the topic you felt was lacking?<br/></b>I never really approached this as a body-issue film. I started working on this in 2011 and that wasn’t really part of the cultural conversation at the time, at least in the way it is now. Her relationship to her body was always a big element of the film as far as her trying to understand what her own value system was, not the value system that the world put on her. But I would consider it a story of a person coming into their own.</p><p>I think we all can relate to this idea that we’re not living the lives we want to live and that we’re maybe not taking ourselves as seriously as we could because we’re afraid that if we try we will fail. I think we’ve been ingrained to feel that failure is a bad thing. For me this was a story about a person who learns to help and dream for herself and pursue these dreams in a way that’s earnest, without losing her edge and irreverence in the process.</p><p><b>I like how you kind of utilized the “friend-zone” in a way most rom-coms don’t know what to do with. What were some of the genre clichés you deliberately resisted?<br/></b>Again, you know, I never really looked at it that way because I come from theater. I really am just looking at the characters and their journey and the story we’re telling and how it all relates back to the theme. It’s not quite how I look at the construction of a story; I’m not starting with the genre. The one thing I was starting with here is I was starting with the archetypes we were familiar with and allowing the story to decidedly go in a different direction by deepening the characters and seeing where the story would go as we deepen the characters.</p><p><b>How do you feel your instincts as a playwright and experience in television informed your approach in making your first feature film? What were the different satisfactions in the process?<br/></b>The good news about theater is that it’s an all-hands-on-deck situation. You’re making things work, you’re solving problems because there are limitations in the space in which you’re telling the story. In an indie film, there are also a lot of limitations. So getting creative with your surroundings and figuring out how to multi-purpose environments so they can be several different settings so your film can have a feeling of scope and a change of scenery, but also be filmed in a certain amount of time, was a technical thing I brought over from theater. But beyond that, it’s all storytelling and it goes back to Aristotle and the poetic and finding heroes with flaws that we can relate to. It’s just, in this movie, I’m just asking that the sidekick is the hero because she deserves to be one too.</p><p><b>You filmed at the New York City Marathon. That sounds very challenging. Can you talk about your experience filming there? Did it go smoothly?<br/></b>It was incredible. There were six of us from the crew permitted to be there. We had three units in the race. It was a monster of a day. And also, the action you see in the marathon is easily one of the most emotional days of the city in the year because everybody is so supportive and lovely and kind to their fellow man. We could feel it that day, and I think you ultimately feel that energy in the film. It’s a magical day to experience in real life and we did our best to honor that.</p><p><b>What was the importance for you of depicting an LGBTQIA+ family in the film?<br/></b>I’m a gay man. I think this story is about giving depth and relatability and asking for empathy for all of the people in the film, many of whom are “others” in our society. I wanted to subvert the idea of the gay best friend as a trope, which is usually in a lot of ways the comic relief or kind of a hot mess, sort of the character Brittany would be in a typical big comedy. I wanted him to have a full life that honored where our culture is headed and made the gay storyline as relatable as any other storyline.</p><p><b>What are the types of films you’d like to make moving forward? Do you see yourself making more personal projects/dramedies like this or maybe adapting your own plays?<br/></b>I’m gonna go wherever the inspiration takes me. One thing a friend of mine observed about my work recently: I tend to like to unfreakify people we freakify. My guess is that thread will remain in my work but I’m going to do it in a whole bunch of different ways I hope. I’m working on something right now that’s a historical thriller but I’m not done with it yet. I’ll let you know.</p><p><b>What was the film that made you want to be a filmmaker?<br/></b>The first film that made me realize that films had the amazing potential to break through to people all through the country in all sorts of situations and make them feel excited by the idea of insight was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-beauty/\"><i>American Beauty</i></a>. I grew up in Georgia in a conservative area in a religious home and the idea that my life could be subverted in a way that movie depicted made me excited to understand more about myself and the world about me and the lies we tell ourselves.</p><p><b>Great choice, it was formative for me too, I resent this backlash it’s been getting.<br/></b><i>American Beauty</i>? Fuck that! It’s great!</p><p><!--figure[4]--><h2>Lil Rel Howery (Demetrius)<br/></h2></p><p><b>What did you connect with most about the script? What was it that stood out to you?<br/></b><i>Lil Rel Howery:</i> How honest it was and how Paul did a good job of writing the human experience on an aspect of you know, “you lose weight, everything becomes peaches and cream” but you have to get your mental health together too. I thought it was dope. Brittany’s character really showed all the different processes of getting it together. She would be running and losing weight and it’s like “everything’s going great now” but then here comes an obstacle. It’s not about the weight, it’s more than that, and I thought that was very deep. I love how, also, he wrote all these stereotypical characters in such a human way without a political agenda to it. He made these beautiful families look like real people.</p><p><b>Most of your scenes you’re acting in front of a computer. What were the challenges of acting without your co-star present? How did your scenes work?<br/></b>I always joke with people, like, “I’ve done more than <i>Get Out</i>”, and they’re like, “Have you ever acted with people before?” I’m joking. It was acting, man. I think one of the things I love about what Paul did a good job of was each of us got our one-on-one with Jillian. And not just one-on-one, especially for us funny people, very dramatic one-on-ones. It wasn’t hard, it was a beautiful well-written movie and for me, that scene with me and Jillian was one of the coolest things I’ve ever filmed because it was filmed with honesty and emotion and I think we did a good job of filling that.</p><p><b>Do you feel eager to show that dramatic side of yourself? How will you reconcile that after establishing yourself as a comic relief?<br/></b>I’ve never put myself in that box. Unfortunately people just love to do that, I guess. With <i>Get Out</i>, as funny as I was in that, I was only funny to people because it was so intense. It wasn’t like I was just telling jokes. I wasn’t doing anything silly. My character Rod was just being honest: “This is what I think is going on.” It’s just funny the way I was saying it because the rest of the movie is insane. I even look at <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bird-box/\"><i>Bird Box</i></a>, that character, I threw in a couple of jokes in there just because I felt like it, but that was a dramatic character. </p><p>Even the scenes in Get Out, most of those things were dramatic. Even doing <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/uncle-drew/\"><i>Uncle Drew</i></a>, I made sure they didn’t make me the funniest person in that movie, especially with a movie with everyone running around with prosthetics. I thought that was crazy. I made sure I was the one who brought the heart into the movie. I’m very specific about what I pick. So I think with my next few films, the ones coming out this year, along with <i>Brittany Runs a Marathon</i> and the stuff I’m filming now, I just think you’re not going to put me in a box. You’re just going to have to call me good at one point.</p><p><b>You are good!<br/></b>[Laughs, generously.]</p><p><b>What are the different pleasures for you working in a scripted format compared to the freedoms you might have on other projects where you can improvise jokes?<br/></b>The crazy thing is, when people hire you they want to hire the best of you, right? I can improv drama. When I met with Paul it was about playing a love interest. We had a conversation of how I loved the script so much and I was talking to him about how I wish the father figure would be aggressive with her and he ended up making me that character where I played the father figure. He created this character based on our conversations. This character didn’t even exist at first.</p><p>I’ve worked with directors so far that trust me, and I trust them along with the creative process. I’m one of those dudes who’s a control improv-er. Maybe some comedians go off the rails. I know what the story is, I know what the moment is, I never go off what we’re supposed to get. My only thing I like to do is make a scene real. Even if the scene is funny, I don’t like to do nothing funny if it ain’t real. If it’s too silly, I don’t want to do it. I’m very big on keeping it real.</p><p>The same goes for my standup. My standup always comes from a real place. I try to make sure, everything I do, every project, every role, even the stuff now, I’m working with some great directors and I’m like, “can we get on the phone today because some of these lines are too stupid. Let’s think of something better and dramatic and I’ll make it funny” [laughs].</p><p><b><i>Get Out</i> is a bonafide classic. It must have been exciting two years ago when it was being lauded and discovered, but in hindsight, it’s a key part of a movement that’s defining Hollywood right now. How does that feel to be part of?<br/></b>It feels great, man. I feel like I’m a part of so many different versions of that. I’ve been lucky, I’ve been able to do some cool stuff, man. I think with <i>Get Out </i>and what that did. I think about even <i>Bird Box</i>, you can do whatever you want, that was a fun time and I loved the script. After that, Netflix said they were breaking all these records. “This is a record-breaking movie.” There are a lot of interesting things I’ve been able to do, which I’m not done with.</p><p>I think for me, <i>Brittany Runs a Marathon</i> falls under that category with <i>Get Out </i>where I don’t think people know what they’re about to get into. I remember telling people that about <i>Get Out</i> and they were like, “Oh, okay”, and I was like, “Naw, you have no idea what this is about to be”. I think <i>Brittany Runs a Marathon</i> is like that too, I don’t think people have any idea how special this movie really is until they see. That’s why I think it’ll do well word-of-mouth more than anything.</p><p><b>Did you get to keep the hoodies for your character’s birthday? That’s the best piece of costume in a film for 2019.<br/></b>[Laughs]. Naw, I didn’t. It’s so funny you say that. I don’t know why I didn’t keep a t-shirt. Damn, I should’ve. I’d keep anything.</p><p><b>What movie made you want to be in movies?<br/></b>Let me tell you something funny. It’s not a film that made me want to take this on at first. It was an episode of <i>Family Ties</i>. It’s the episode where his friend got killed by a drunk driver [season 5, episodes 23 and 24; a two-parter titled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A,_My_Name_is_Alex\">A, My Name is Alex</a> which won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series in 1987]. Michael J. Fox performed in a way, you know, you watch things to be entertained at first? But that was the first time I watched an actor and I was like, “Yo, this is crazy good”. Then he did like a one-man show in the second part, like a play where he was walking on different parts of the set and it was different parts of his life. Man, I thought that was brilliant. I thought, ‘Whatever job this is, this is what I want to do!’ [laughs].</p>"

They went another direction, which is a kind way of saying they hired somebody else for like a year or so, then it came back around and we chased it really hard.</p><p>I just remember the first time we sat with Tripp and Jamie and Guy [Busick] and Ryan [Christopher Murphy], the writers, it felt like a group of people who should’ve been working together for a long time. We all had the same sensibilities, we were all aiming at the same target, we all wanted to make the same movie. And it’s one of the few scripts we’ve ever read and were like “Oh man, I wish we wrote this”. This was the voice that we wanna be speaking in. So it really just spoke to us and it was a great process. They were still doing drafts for us up until production.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Was there anything specific that you felt helped elevate it beyond other survival horrors?<br/></b><i>Tyler Gillett (co-director):</i><b> </b>I think the thing that really grabbed us from the start that felt like it was so specific to the identity of <i>Ready or Not</i>, was this really crazy ensemble of characters and how well drawn each of them [is]. It’s so common in the genre space to just play everyone really arch and not give the characters a really specific point of view and to not ground the film and the crazy fantasy elements of it in real emotional drama and a real emotional point-of-view, and this script was just full of that for us. We loved that. The villains are so clearly the villains and our heroine is so clearly that character, but there is something fun and relatable and interesting about the interactions between all of them that isn’t just: “Oh hey, I have a gun or I have a bow and arrow and I’m gonna chase you and I’m gonna try to kill you”. There’s a lot more going on under the surface.</p><p>Obviously the superficial thrill of it is it’s a woman on the run, but at its heart, it’s a movie that’s about family and it’s about faith and it’s about trying to figure out who you are as an outsider entering this crazy realm. We could draw on that every single day on the shoot and it certainly helped us attach this great cast. There was so much about the depth of those characters that we just felt: wow, this is an undeniably great genre movie, but it’s also an undeniably great family drama, it’s an undeniably great satire.</p><p>That’s at the heart of it for us. Whether you’re spending time with the family or you’re on the run with Grace, it feels believable even though it’s heightened and insane. We get that the general thesis of the movie is wildly ridiculous, but the characters don’t think it’s ridiculous.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What do you think this film gains from having a female protagonist?</b><br/><i>Chad Villella (executive producer):</i><b> </b>I think the entire movie revolves around Grace. We were extremely fortunate to have Samara Weaving, somebody who can carry the weight of the film the entire way through. From our very first meeting with Samara, she brought this punk-rock vibe to the role. It was always something we talked about but weren’t quite sure how we were going to execute. And Samara just brought it with her performance, and by just bringing that rebellious nature after the family turns on her. She wasn’t gonna just sit around and be a victim, she was gonna fight back, and she was gonna fight the whole way through it. She said she didn’t wanna be screaming the entire way through this movie. She was gonna have moments where she could just dig in and let the family have it, and I think she did that in spades.</p><p><b>There’s an interesting use of violence in this film. Do you have a philosophy around how far to take that sort of thing?</b><br/><i>MB-O:</i> The short answer is we just follow our tastes, you know? The movie is in line with our personal tastes, and we enjoy a good kill and a good shock, but we don’t like revelling in the gore really, it’s never really been our thing. But we like the effect of it on both sides. One of the things that we think is most effective and we’ve always enjoyed, is focusing more on the reaction than the actual violence. </p><p>It’s always scarier or funnier to see people <i>reacting</i> to something, than it is to be watching the actual thing. That really helped us because we were able to then kind of stay within the guardrails we’d set up for ourselves, because from the script stage and pre-production, let alone production, we were always aware that if we go too far in one direction it’s going to derail everything around it. You can’t exactly laugh after you’ve seen something that makes you literally wanna throw up. So we had to find that [line], and to be honest we found some of that in the edit, too. We had a lot of stuff on both sides of that, the gore and the violence, and also on the humor, where we were like, “Okay, we have to make sure that it stays grounded, as ridiculous and over the top as it is”.</p><p><i><b>Ready or Not</b></i><b> makes great use of the aesthetics of arcane magic and board games—was it fun to revel in that space?</b><br/><i>TG:</i> We all are huge fans of that stuff. Not only did we all grow up playing board games with our families, we loved that analogue gaming language that exists in this movie. It feels really old and it feels like it’s really steeped in tradition. That was really important to us, to make us feel like these games, the games that the family has created and built their empire on, that it’s a continuation of a deal with this benefactor that’s existed for many generations. So the choice to make all of those games analogue, it felt really tactile and it felt really interesting. We could put board games up in the house as part of the production design. Even the choosing box [from which Grace selects her fate, glimpsed in the header image for this article] itself has this very board-game quality to it.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>When we were pitching on the movie, some of the very first images that we created from a directorial point of view were about the juxtaposition between these moments of terror, against this board-game backdrop. We actually created this Monopoly board that essentially represented all the members of the family in the property squares that we are all familiar with and the weapons and all of that. That was a really defining moment for us, just in terms of figuring out the tone; it all came from the thrill of a board game and then the very real stakes of what this night means for Grace and for her survival.</p><p>So the games were always this guiding light, and a reminder to keep things fun. As much as the movie is certainly about specific themes and as much as it’s certainly about the terror and nightmare that this woman goes through on what’s supposed to be the best day of her life, we just always wanted to make sure that it was an entertaining ride first and foremost. The gaming backdrop did us a lot of favors in achieving that.</p>"

I remember my father has always been a big fan. When I was about nine, he arrived home very excited because he just saw a movie where there were people in a room but they couldn’t get out of the room [1962’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-exterminating-angel/\"><i>The Exterminating Angel</i></a>] and I was really fascinated while he was explaining it to me, I was like “wow!”.</p><p>When I grew up a little bit more I discovered films from Buñuel, I think he was always somehow in my family in this way. But the fact of doing this film, it was actually because [producer] Manuel Cristóbal called me and showed me the comic by Fermin Solís and he was asking me “do we think we can make a movie of that?” I started reading it and while I thought ‘I do not agree with some things…’ I did think ‘we can make a movie about that’.</p><p><b>What would you say was the documentary’s importance in how it changed Buñuel’s career as a filmmaker from that point forward?<br/></b>I think it was a turning point for him. Before <i>Las Hurdes</i>, the surrealism that Buñuel was working on took a big influence from [painter Salvador] Dalí. It was totally based on images and things that had not really an explanation. That’s the way they were working. The town of Las Hurdes changed his way of proceeding the making of a film and of telling a story. He became more human.</p><p>You see what happened with all his films after <i>Las Hurdes</i>, his surrealism is more based on the human soul. The first film that he did afterwards as an author was <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-young-and-the-damned/\">Los Olvidados</a>,</i> seventeen years later, and during all that time he learned a lot. After that, all his films that made him really famous was his way to see surrealism in the way we dictate day-by-day.</p><p><b>What was your creative process for the surrealistic scenes?<br/></b>I did sketch the whole film from the beginning to the end. What we’re calling the surrealism scenes in the film [were] also a way to see into his mind, to tell part of his behavior, his feelings, and even his past. It was in this global way to tell the story of Buñuel to people that is a little bit surrealist.</p><p>We never had the intention to copy anything of his way of making film, but we had great influence from him because we’d been working on him for all these years. For this movie I felt like Buñuel and I were walking the same paths. In <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/land-without-bread/\">Las Hurdes</a></i> he was trying to find his own voice and in this film it was a little bit the same for me, so it has been doubly [influenced] by him and his way to be an artist.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>What led to the decision to include footage from Buñuel’s actual films rather than recreating them in animation?<br/></b>Because they were there. We wanted to show that what happened was real and it was really tough. If we drew that, people would believe it was part of the animation and that we made it up. The best way to see what they were seeing at the time was from the actual footage they shot in 1932.</p><p>In Spain, for many years it has been a great controversy about what Buñuel did with his documentary—whether it was real or if he made it up—but what people don’t know is that Buñuel based [it] on an existing book he read by French-Hispanic Maurice Legendre [entitled <i>Las Jurdes: étude de géographie humaine</i>, English translation: <i>Las Hurdes: Study of Human Geography</i>, published in 1927]. He was there about ten years before and he wrote 300 to 400 pages describing what was the situation in Las Hurdes.</p><p>In that book, what Legendre was writing about is worse than what Buñuel did. What Buñuel was trying to show [was] what was happening in that place, to try to change the world. You have to think that in that time, many of the surrealists, they were trying to change the world and make it better. This was Buñuel’s way to do it. He was denouncing what was happening.</p><p>Of course the government at the time covered up all of that because they didn’t want to accept that was real, but people were actually dying and starving and they were [contracting] diseases. It was terrible. Buñuel put it on the screen when cinema was starting. People who were going to the cinema were the bourgeoisie and they were not used to seeing these things. They were used to seeing stories of high society and not used to seeing what Buñuel had to show them. It was a big scandal and they forbid this film for many years.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>This film acts more as a tribute to [Buñuel’s producer and friend] Ramón Acín than to the filmmaker himself, and delivers Acín the credit he deserves. At what point in your research did you decide to switch the focus to him?<br/></b>When we were working on the movie I remember at the beginning thinking I need to make the end of the movie more inspiring. Then we talked with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Gibson_(author)\">Ian Gibson</a>, the biographer of Luis Buñuel, and he told us the story of Ramón Acín. At the beginning he just was kind of a character we were using in a way to show some part of the characteristics of Buñuel at the time.</p><p>When he told us the story we thought ‘maybe it’s a story of friendship’. He actually win the lottery after he told him “no worries, if I win the lottery I will pay for the film” and four weeks later he wins the lottery and keeps his word. I thought ‘wow, that’s amazing. He keeps his word!’. I would be surprised if anyone would nowadays.</p><p>At the end, it’s not only a tribute to Ramón Acín and Buñuel, it’s also a tribute to the good people that [are] all around the world. We’re too used to hearing about the bad people on the news, but actually we’re surrounded by very amazing people and I think the film is also a tribute to them. Somehow with Ramon, it was the good man who represented that in the film.</p><p><b>Acín acted as the voice of morality regarding the treatment of animals, which is what made the film controversial at the time. Did you use him in that sense to comment on Buñuel’s actions?<br/></b>Not exactly, to be honest, no. I know the treatment of animals is tough, and I don’t agree with it at all, but I think we need to see this. That was what was happening in 1932. We cannot be blind to that. If we just censor that, we will not be honest about what was happening in that time. Society had different rules and a totally different mentality.</p><p>At that time talking about animal rights is like talking science fiction. Why should we have to hide that, because we don’t like it now? I think we have to show it because that’s what happened, whether we like it or not. You’d be surprised at how many countries in the world keep doing these things to animals. Even in Spain, the bullfighting still happens.</p><p>Buñuel was always pushing the lines for the people and making them actually jump off their chair. That’s a little bit of what we wanted to do with this film, to make people jump off their chairs too.</p><p><b>We like to ask filmmakers about the film made them want to get into making movies. Which film was it for you?<br/></b>Actually for me, it was not a film, it was my daughter. I’ve been working 30 years in animation as an animator. Then when my daughter was born I wanted to make more short films about the things that she was interested in. I wanted to tell the stories to her.</p><p><b>Which is your favorite Buñuel film?<br/></b>A lot of them are great, but <i>Los Olvidados</i> is an explosion of Buñuel for me.</p>"

Mason and Victor Heerman</i></p><p>Now we’re getting to the meat &amp; potatoes of <i>Little Women </i>standom. Not that it’s a competition, but Katherine Hepburn is the one Saoirse Ronan needs to beat. Hepburn set the screen standard for gutsy portrayals of Jo March, and appropriately so in this first version with sound because let’s be honest, when the world got to hear Jo March speak those lines aloud for the first time, Hepburn’s voice was the perfect choice.</p><p>The prolific Cukor was nominated for the best directing Oscar (he eventually won one in 1964 for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/my-fair-lady/\">My Fair Lady</a></i>), but it was the screenwriters, married couple Mason and Heerman, who won the Academy Award for their script. (Hepburn also won that year, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/morning-glory/\">but not for playing Jo March</a>.)</p><p><b>Letterboxd ranking: #3. </b>“A true gem of depression-era cinema,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tajlv/film/little-women/\">Taj</a>. “Every single scene in the first half of this film is a pure delight.”</p><p>“I’d like to personally thank Katharine Hepburn for being absolutely perfect,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/darkvictoryy/film/little-women/\">Skylar</a>. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/morgan_lightle/film/little-women/\">Morgan</a> concurs: “Hepburn plays Jo with a rough physicality, bold confidence, and a gentle sensibility, standing out in a rather unremarkable movie.”<br/></p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-1949/\">Little Women</a></b></i><b> (1949)</b><br/><i>Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, screenplay by Sally Benson, Victor Heerman, Sarah Y. Mason, and Andrew Solt</i></p><p>Why re-write a script that’s already perfect? Mervyn LeRoy’s 1949 Technicolor update lifted most of the screenplay and music from Cukor’s version, throwing in an on-trend acting line-up of June Allyson (Jo), Janet Leigh (Meg), Elizabeth Taylor (Amy) and Margaret O’Brien (Beth).</p><p>Never mind who played Laurie in this version (okay, okay, it was hunky Rat-Packing socialite <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/peter-lawford/\">Peter Lawford</a>); the real tea here is the American film debut of Bologna-born Italian great <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/rossano-brazzi/\">Rossano (<i>The Italian Job)</i> Brazzi</a>, as Professor Bhaer.</p><p><b>Letterboxd ranking: #2. </b>“This is the best <i>Little Women</i>, fight me,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dylandog/film/little-women-1949/\">DylanDog</a> declares. “I’m so impressed by the fact that they rewrote/restructured/padded out the 1933 screenplay, assembled a nearly pitch-perfect cast, and made such a fantastic Technicolor remake,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/benalexander/film/little-women-1949/\">Dino</a> reasons. “We actually see way more of the novel’s subversive gender politics play out here, and Jo’s motivations are much more palpable.”</p><p>“Although I also really like the <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/annewithe/film/little-women/\">1933 version</a>, the Hepburn film lacks the warmth I do find in the 1949 adaptation,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/annewithe/film/little-women-1949/\">Annewithe</a> writes. “I feel that this version conveys the true spirit of the book and is as cozy and warm and loving, and it’s in colour!”</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-1979/\">Little Women</a></i> (1978)</b><br/><i>Directed by David Lowell Rich, screenplay by Suzanne Clauser</i></p><p>Between 1949 and 1994, all we got was this seventies miniseries adaptation, which flies far under the radar of Letterboxd’s <i>Little Women</i> obsession with only two member reviews.</p><p>Susan Dey was a smart choice to play Jo March, given her <i>Partridge Family </i>profile at the time, while Meredith Baxter Birney, who played Meg, went onto huge sitcom fame as Michael J. Fox’s mom in <i>Family Ties.</i> The real curiosity factor here, writes LouReviews, is “the casting of one William Shatner as the Professor, and he’s rather good!”.</p><p><b>Letterboxd ranking: #6. </b>“This story keeps moving me,” is all <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sandra27/film/little-women-1979/\">Sandra</a> had to say, while <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/loureviews/film/little-women-1979/\">LouReviews</a> writes “not essential by any means, but if you like the novel, you&rsquo;ll want to see this”.<br/></p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-1994/\"><b>Little Women</b></a></i><b> (1994)</b><br/><i>Directed by Gillian Armstrong, screenplay by Robin Swicord </i></p><p>It only took 126 years from publication for a woman to get behind the camera of a <i>Little Women</i> film, despite Alcott’s masterpiece long being a prime example of (white privileged) female complexity in storytelling. (Although, it’s fair to note that women have been involved in the scriptwriting for every <i>Little Women </i>film adaptation that we know of.)</p><p>Released—as Gerwig’s 2019 update will be—at Christmas, Gillian Armstrong’s version was as star-studded as they come, with 90s it-girl Winona Ryder—fresh off <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/reality-bites/\">Reality Bites</a>—</i>as Jo March, and Christian Bale as Laurie<i>. </i>Also: Kirsten Dunst, Samantha Mathis and Eric Stoltz, with Susan Sarandon as Marmee.</p><p><b>Letterboxd ranking: #1. </b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/campbart/film/little-women-1994/\">Sydney</a> writes: “It’s really tough dealing with the fact that this movie is probably never going to get the respect it deserves.” Well Sydney, we’re happy to make your day.

Emily Watson plays the March matriarch, and—Gerwig connection alert!—Kathryn Newton (<i>Lady Bird</i>’s Darlene) is Amy March.</p><p><b>Letterboxd ranking: #5. </b>Alicia is a fan: “Winona will always be my Jo, but Emily Watson absolutely kills it as Marmee! Just love her FACE!!!! Her pain is your pain; her joy is your joy. Oyyy!”</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bethchestnut/film/little-women-2017/\">Bethchestnut</a> was slowly convinced: “A very handsome and loving production, even if there were a lot of things that bothered me about it.

Don’t pretend you don’t know what <i>Cats</i> is.</p><p><b>No, seriously.<br/></b>Okay, so <i>Cats</i> is a musical, composed by the overlord of British musical theater, Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1981. He’s also the man behind <i>The Phantom of The Opera, Evita, Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat</i>… the list goes on and on. And on.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>So it’s a musical about cats? That’s literally it?<br/></b>Yes. Based on <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Old-Possums-Book-Practical-Cats/dp/015668568X\">Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats</a></i>, by T.S. Eliot.</p><p><b>T.S. Eliot who wrote <i>The Wasteland</i>?<br/></b>Yes. He also liked cats. A lot. Like, he wrote a whole book of poems about how much he liked cats, to entertain his nieces and nephews.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>That… okay. So, what is <i>Cats</i>?<br/></b>Well, we join our feline friends on the evening of the Jellicle Ball—</p><p><b>The what?<br/></b>Okay, so, ‘jellicle’ is just how T.S. Eliot would describe cats. It’s a corruption of the words ‘dear little’, and in this instance, refers to the tribe of mischievous kitties who gather under the cover of darkness for a special party.</p><p><b>So the musical is about the party?<br/></b>Erm, sort of. Actually, it’s really just a sort of song-and-dance routine where the cats try to decide which one of them will be selected to ascend to a new life on the Heaviside Layer.</p><p><b>Excuse me?<br/></b>The Jellicle Ball is called to order by the wise leader of the Jellicle Cats—Old Deuteronomy—who announces that one of them will be selected for this great honor of transcending our world and going on to a better realm. They each introduce themselves to the audience—and argue their case for being the cat that deserves to shuffle off this mortal coil—with a little song and dance.</p><p><b>So it’s a talent contest where all the contestants are dancing cats, and the prize is death?<br/></b>Yes, it’s all very <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/black-mirror-white-christmas/\">Black Mirror</a></i>.</p><p><b>And it’s going to be a film?<br/></b>Directed by Tom Hooper, the luminary auteur behind <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-kings-speech/\">The King’s Speech</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/les-miserables-2012/\">Les Misérables</a> </i>and<i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-danish-girl/\">The Danish Girl</a></i>.</p><p><b>Why is this happening?<br/></b>Because the Earth is dying and we’re all losing our minds, so anything goes at the cinema. Also, because musicals make a lot of money—even the ones the critics don’t like. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-greatest-showman/\">The Greatest Showman</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bohemian-rhapsody/\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mamma-mia-here-we-go-again/\">Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</a></i>. People like films based on stories they recognize, and they like singing along. It actually makes perfect sense from a financial standpoint, if not an ethical one.</p><p><b>But… why do the cats look so weird?<br/></b>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzsDroK9CNs\">star-studded featurette</a> that preceded the trailer, there was much fanfair about Tom Hooper’s “digital fur technology”, which is being implemented to transform the actors into catctors. In the stage show, the performers usually just wear outfits and face paint that makes them look a bit like cats, but apparently that just wasn’t going to cut it for Hooper. But it just looks a bit wrong, doesn’t it? The human noses, the human hands, the strange cat-person-to-furniture scale they’re working with… there’s a lot going on.</p><p><b>What about all the cats in the trailer?<br/></b>Well, there are approximately 500 cats in <i>Cats</i>, but we got a good look at some of the key players. The first cat we see is Victoria—she’s a ballerina kitten.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Then there’s Mr. Mistoffelees, the black and white cat in the top hat. He’s a magician. Did you ever see a cat so clever?</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>Dame Judi Dench is playing Old Deuteronomy in this version, and wearing a large fur coat, possibly made from the skins of cats she’s bested in battle.<br/></p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Then there’s Jennifer Hudson, playing Grizabella. She has the best song in the whole show, ‘Memory’, which is also the one you’re most likely to remember from your school talent shows when the one theater kid who really went for it would belt that out on stage and everyone’s parents would cry.<br/></p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>We’ve also got James Corden as Bustopher Jones, a gentleman cat, and Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, the flirtatious lady cat.<br/></p><p><b>Why does she have boobs?<br/></b>It’s best not to dwell on that.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>Is that Jason Derulo?<br/></b>Yes. He plays Rum Tum Tugger, the cat whose whole personality revolves around him being a bit of a shagger.</p><p><!--figure[7]--></p><p><b>What’s Idris Elba doing?<br/></b>Skulking around as Macavity the Mystery Cat, the villain of the story (also called ‘The Hidden Paw’). I won’t go into details. I don’t know why he’s wearing a hat—in general, this version has a lot more hats than the stage show. There are plenty more cats to come too: Skimbleshanks, the Railway Cat; Gus the Theater Cat, played by Sir Ian McKellen. A cat for every occasion.</p><p><!--figure[8]--></p><p><b>Why do you know so much about <i>Cats</i>, Hannah?<br/></b>Listen, I was a very theatrical child. <i>Cats</i> was the first stage show I ever saw, and I was obsessed with the VHS we had of the original film, which was a recording of the musical. I really don’t jive with Tom Hooper as a filmmaker, so this has been a difficult time for me. My only love, sprung from my only hate.</p><p><b>But… why?<br/></b>Listen, when you’re eight years old, you just want to see something cool every now and then. Remember the bit in <i>The Incredibles</i> where Mr. Incredible is asking the kid on the street what he’s waiting for, and the kid says, “I don’t know! Something amazing, I guess!” That’s what being a kid is. For me, seeing <i>Cats</i> was that. My mind was blown. There’s more than a little nostalgia tied into my feelings regarding <i>Cats</i>, and let me be clear: I don’t think this film will be good, per se, but I’m sure I’ll be entertained. Sometimes that’s enough.</p><p><b>Crikey. What will they think of next?<br/></b>Well, if <i>Cats</i> makes a truckload of money, maybe they’ll finally make a film version of <i>Starlight Express</i>, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s rollerskating musical about trains.</p><p><b>Trains?<br/></b>Yes. Singing trains. It’s 2019, why the hell not.</p>"

I was floored by the beauty of that film. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mimic/\">Mimic</a></i> terrified me, I loved it. Even though I know there is a tough history behind that film and the cut that came out, I still found it terrifying. And then <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-ii/\">Blade II</a></i> was just one of those amazing sequels that stood out beyond the original.</p><p>That didn’t really happen very often back in those days, that the sequel was better than the original. And on and on with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pans-labyrinth/\">Pan’s Labyrinth</a> </i>and one great movie after another, culminating with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shape-of-water/\">The Shape of Water</a></i>. But our relationship started on Twitter; he tweeted about <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-autopsy-of-jane-doe/\">The Autopsy of Jane Doe</a></i>, that he enjoyed it. And we had a Twitter exchange about that.</p><p><b>Had he seen <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/troll-hunter/\">Troll Hunter</a></i>? It seems like it would be right up his alley.</b><br/>Yeah he had, and he liked it. Obviously I’m sure he’s paid attention to other people’s love for monsters and creatures.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>So how did you end up getting this job?<br/></b>He was supposed to direct <i>Scary Stories </i>himself. It was supposed to be his next movie after <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shape-of-water/\">The Shape of Water</a></i>, and then he decided not to make it his next movie and they decided, well, let’s find another director. He proposed me to the other producers on the film, Sean Daniel and J. Miles Dale, and they all agreed that I would be a good fit.</p><p>They offered me the script to read and of course I fell in love with it immediately. It’s the kind of movie I grew up loving, like an <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theclassicshift/list/amblin-entertainment/\">Amblin</a>-esque movie, but the idea being to do it with a horror sensibility and make it really scary. I thought it would be a great movie for me to be able to make. And speaking of the PG-13 audience, it was what I grew up with as well. When I was a kid in my teens, those were the movies I got to see. So I felt very close to this movie through the whole process.</p><p><b>There is indeed a nice Amblin vibe informing this movie. How would you describe that vibe, if you had to put it into words?</b><br/>There is a sense of humor. It’s out to entertain more than it’s out to hurt you as a horror movie. It’s not an existential horror. It’s not out to grind you down. It’s out to use horror as fun; there’s a playfulness. It’s oftentimes several characters, a group of friends, that these movies are about. It has a high energy and it can go from intense, suspenseful, or in this case very scary and horrible, to playful banter between friends. I think that broad range creates a feeling of real life. </p><p>All the characters in those movies back then were very grounded; even though they were fun and had a lot of energy, they also had real issues in life, they also came from a background where there were serious things they were dealing with. I found that very interesting, especially about the character of Stella, who has a lot of things in her life that are profoundly affecting her. And how that also relates to the life of the antagonist, Sarah Bellows. And in some ways how it feeds into today. I think the social commentary thing is clear in Amblin films as well.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>How challenging was it to make this good ’n scary without it ever spilling over into being too ‘adult’?<br/></b>It’s about playing with the audience. The audience should know that they should enjoy being… tormented, if you will. So it’s kind of trying to communicate both ways. So I’m like, setting something up, I’m always thinking of the audience, shot-by-shot-by-shot. How does the audience feel? If we put the camera here, what will the audience feel then? If we put it up here, how will the audience react then? And if we cut from there to there? It’s all about communication. I’m trying to imagine how it’s going to make the audience feel, so it’s about back and forth. I think that creates a playful tone. It’s fun-scary, as opposed to you feeling scared because it’s disgusting or something.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>What do you think this film gained from tying together the various short stories into a single narrative, as opposed to having them play out in the traditional anthology format?</b><br/>Guillermo has said something that is kinda true about anthology films, which is that they’re never as good as the best [story], and they’re always as bad as the worst [story]. So you always have one story that isn’t great, and it kind of deflates the whole experience. In a way, [a traditional anthology movie] isn’t a whole experience because you never get to engage in characters for a long time and feel all their dilemmas, because as soon as you’re out of [each story], you’re on the next one. And that can work, but I’m not attracted to that as a storytelling form, it’s just a personal thing. Many other people are, and thank god for that, because then we get a diverse set of movies.</p><p>I love a full narrative. When I received the script for <i>Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark</i>, I thought it was an anthology, so when I opened it, I was so happy when it wasn’t, because by page ten I was in love with the characters and then I saw that I was going to follow them all the way.<br/></p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>We’re massive fans of </b><i><b>Troll Hunter </b></i><b>at Letterboxd.<br/></b>That’s fantastic, that’s great. It’s a great site. I go there a lot to see people talking about the movies.</p><p><b>What kind of life has that film had since it was released? Everyone who sees it loves it, but it deserved a much bigger audience. Was a remake or sequel ever considered?<br/></b>There was talk of a remake. Chris Columbus [writer of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gremlins/\">Gremlins</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-goonies/\">The Goonies</a></i>, and director of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/home-alone/\">Home Alone</a> </i>and the first two <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone/\">Harry Potter</a> </i>films], and a company called CJ Entertainment, bought the rights for it years ago. So I was in awe—one of the heroes of my youth, Chris Columbus. So I was sorry to see that that never came through. We talked about a sequel of course, but I feel like I told the story of this world, and anything else would just be more trolls.<br/><b><br/>The way you used scale in that film was amazing. No blockbusters made since have come close to how effectively you conveyed the gargantuan size of the creatures.<br/></b>That’s great to hear. I don’t know how other people shoot movies but it was shot so much in reality. I mean, we CGI-ed in the creatures, but everything else was so grounded and real with a hand-held camera. We were just running around in the wilderness shooting it for real. So we naturally had to position it, physically, in some natural way, a very simple natural way, and maybe that helped.</p><p><i>‘Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark’ is in US theaters now, and rolling out globally over the next few months.

I still remember watching it by myself alone on a Friday night at the age of twelve on TV. I didn’t know films like this existed. The opening car crash. Juliette Binoche’s face. The incredible camera work by Slawomir Idziak. The majestic score from Zbigniew Preisner. And the way Krzysztof Kieslowski brings it all together to explore grief and renewal in the context of a Europe redefining itself as well. This was the film there was no turning back from. It’s the reason I’m making films today.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/do-the-right-thing/\"><b><i>Do The Right Thing</i></b></a> (1989)<br/><i>Directed by Spike Lee</i></p><p>I was also only about twelve when I first saw <i>Do the Right Thing</i>. The only other Spike Lee I’d seen before it was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/malcolm-x-1992/\"><i>Malcolm X</i></a>. It was soon after I moved to America. I loved <i>X</i>, but <i>Do the Right Thing</i> got seared into my mind. The colors and textures of Ernest Dickerson’s photography. Bill Lee’s vibrant score. Every. Single. Performance. And of course the powerful ending Spike crafted. The questions it asked of all of us are ones America is still struggling to answer.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/secrets-lies/\"><i>Secrets &amp; Lies</i></a></b> (1996)<br/><i>Directed by Mike Leigh</i></p><p>I’ll never forget Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s face in this movie. Or Brenda Blethyn’s as well. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the first times I saw a movie where people actually felt like… people. The simplicity of the storytelling was the reason it was able to resonate with so much complexity. Yet Dick Pope’s photography was still richly cinematic. This was my first Mike Leigh movie. It made me want to seek out everything he did.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-clockwork-orange/\"><i>A Clockwork Orange</i></a></b> (1971)<br/><i>Directed by Stanley Kubrick</i></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shining/\"><i>The Shining</i></a> was my first Kubrick movie, but it took revisiting years afterwards to full comprehend its achievement. But <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> landed on the first bounce when I saw it at fourteen. From the pull-back from Alex’s face in the Korova Milk Bar to the final slow-motion fantasy shot of him, I was hooked by the ruthless intelligence, satirical wit and moral complexity of what Kubrick was exploring by way of Anthony Burgess’ novel. That and of course Wendy Carlos’ absolutely groundbreaking score.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/in-the-mood-for-love/\"><b><i>In The Mood for Love</i></b></a> (2000)<br/><i>Directed by Wong Kar-Wai</i></p><p>I don’t know how many times I’ve watched this film. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/days-of-being-wild/\"><i>Days of Being Wild</i></a> is probably my favorite WKW. But this was the one that helped cement the passion to pursue filmmaking when I was seventeen. The grace and subtlety of the story. The way it operates as a memory play that still feels like a present-tense story that isn’t just drowned in nostalgia. The perfect harmony of William Chang’s editing, production and costume design and the image-making of Mark Lee Ping-Bing and Christopher Doyle. It’s so rare to see a movie where every single element of the filmmaking is so in sync and all in service of the incredible performances by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung.</p>"

As someone who [has] Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) this was one of the most difficult films I have ever sat through. I cried. I grabbed my neighbor’s arm. A fantastic film that I will 100% never watch again.” Tyler <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tk2385/film/them-that-follow/\">agrees</a> that the snake content is “horrifying, but that’s not the main focus. The focus is on characters…”.</p><p>Following the film’s screening at SXSW earlier this year, Letterboxd had a quick catch-up with actors Alice Englert and Thomas Mann.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>When did you first hear about snake-handling?<br/></b><i>Alice Englert (Mara)</i>: For me it was this film. I hadn’t heard about it before I read the script. It made a dramatic and poetic sense to me in some way.</p><p><i>Thomas Mann (Augie)</i>: I think I saw like, a <i>Dateline</i> thing at one point. Just like passing through the channels and I saw it. When I saw the script I was like “I feel like I’ve heard about this”, but nothing more than that. I researched it once I read the script.</p><p><b>What did Britt and Dan say to you about how they wanted to approach this pretty obscure topic?<br/></b><i>AE:</i> I think they wanted to try and create a portrait that felt respectful and as unbiased as possible, and definitely to tell a story that was about the humanity of it. And the connection.</p><p><i>TM:</i> It’s so easy to [say], “Oh it’s the snake movie” but it’s not really about that. It could be about anything or any strong belief that you don’t agree with. So I think it’s kind of a placeholder for a lot of different things that are going on in people’s lives right now. Snakes are just an example…</p><p><i>AE: …</i>of extremity.</p><p><i>TM:</i> Yeah. Or of the definitive yes or no, black or white, a snake bites you or it doesn’t. You&rsquo;re either with God or you’re not. There’s no nuance to the whole thing. And I think that’s a problem.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Did you have any exposure to this world in prepping for the film?<br/></b><i>TM:</i> We drove to a Pentecostal church one weekend.</p><p><i>AE:</i> We went on Pastor Appreciation Day. They were apologizing because it wasn’t a usual day.</p><p><i>TM:</i> This wasn’t a snake-handling church.</p><p><i>AE:</i> It’s illegal everywhere in America, except for West Virginia. You can handle snakes in West Virginia. It’s really hard to go to those churches. Also it’s really hard for a film production to be okay about letting their actors go.</p><p><i>TM:</i> We thought about going to one, but our producer told us we couldn’t.</p><p><i>AE:</i> I also read about it in a book called <i>Salvation on Sand Mountain</i> by Dennis Covington, which is a fantastic book and everyone should read it. It’s really interesting. It’s a journal, so it’s a non-fiction account of his time that he spent with these snake-handling communities.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Do you feel like you’ve come to understand what people might get from this ritual?<br/></b><i>TM:</i> That’s like step one when you read a script like this. It’s like, okay, why the fuck are they doing this? And that’s what you try to get to the bottom of. And it’s something that’s ingrained in you.</p><p><i>AE:</i> Humanity wanting to test itself is very universal and I get that totally, that wanting to kind of face what you fear is the most primal journey that you have, so I absolutely get their perspective. But I’m not gonna do it.</p><p><i>TM:</i> Same here. I understand that they feel they have no choice, they feel like this is the only way.</p><p><i>AE:</i> I also understand that this isn’t how I feel and want to live my life, but there are a lot of people who feel as though you have to be certain, and that being uncertain hides the truth in you. Certainty in faith allows you to journey to your place of realization and I don’t agree with that. I think you should be able to question everything as much as you possibly want. I don’t think nature is made with the rules that we imagined.</p><p><b>Was it challenging to get past the inherent ridiculousness of snake-handling while acting in this film?<br/></b><i>TM:</i> Yeah and that’s what was kind of the fun part. Like, you go up to the snake and you look at the snake, like the snake holds all the power and you’re subordinate to it.</p><p><i>AE:</i> Yeah of course. We’re actors, we’ve done fantasy films. Letting go of the absurdity, we have to do it.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i>TM:</i> To see Jim [Gaffigan] and Olivia [Colman] together, the opening church scenes. You just need people to commit or otherwise the audience is not gonna believe it. And you have to make it make sense for you too.</p><p><i>AE:</i> I do this for the absurdity.</p><p><i>TM:</i> Same here, the absurd stuff in this movie was really absurd and that’s always better for me.</p><p><b>Mara is torn between her various obligations. Alice, could you relate to that?<br/></b><i>AE:</i> I related to the pressure that I felt to perform as a good girl or a nice girl or as a human being that’s presentable and the realization that that’s not the journey I want to go on anymore: how to be appropriate for other people. I don’t want to go on that journey anymore, I don’t think it leads anywhere that is deep or wise I think it just leads in circles and into a fear/shame cycle and I’m sick of it. I’m sick of the abyss of fitting in and I definitely relate to that for Mara, the stress of it.</p>"

We want to focus on the bigger questions that you have raised around how we moderate content.</p><p>Firstly: dangerous fascist and white supremacist ideologies can go to hell. We remove such content from our service regularly. We want to catch it all. We&rsquo;ve changed our<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/legal/community-policy/\"> community policy</a> as of today to reflect this, adding in an explicit line rejecting content that “expressly praises, supports, promotes or represents white nationalist ideology”.</p><p>Secondly: what we’ve heard most loudly from you over the past 24 hours is: “Why delete this review, while allowing other harassing comments towards women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people…?”</p><p>We read everything that’s reported to us, and a lot besides, and we remove or hide everything that violates our community policy. When we get it wrong, you, our community lets us know and we take a closer look. We also take the opportunity to review our internal processes, to ensure we’re doing our best.</p><p>Often we hide content, rather than removing it. Hiding means the content isn’t visible anywhere except on the member’s profile, or if you already have a link to it. We’ve realized that the content is still searchable, so we are removing moderated content from search results as well. Hiding is effective but we don’t want this stuff, period—hidden or not—so we are also broadening what we consider removable to include more of what we all find objectionable.</p><p>If you’d like more insight on how our moderation process works and what improvements we have planned around it, read on below.</p><p>We’re committed to Letterboxd being a safe, creative space for you to share your love of film.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>The Letterboxd crew</p><p><b>About Letterboxd moderation</b></p><ul><li>Because we’re <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ex-machina-2014/\">untrusting</a>, we moderate using humans rather than AI tools (save for spam detection). Where other platforms use machine learning to track objectionable text, we have chosen to rely on our community to report objectionable content to us. Our moderators respond to content when it gets flagged. We work as quickly as we can to respond, with the majority of reports actioned within 48 hours.</li><li>As a first step, content that breaches our policy is hidden from view for most members. Moderated content is visible only to its author’s followers, or if you follow a direct (probably external) link. If our moderators feel the policy violation is serious enough to warrant being removed, they can refer it accordingly.</li><li>Supplementing what you report, our moderators are also empowered to respond to content they notice. There is a bias here towards more popular content: if something hateful is posted by someone with a small audience, it’s less likely to come to our attention quickly. We’re looking at ways to improve this.</li><li>Those members that cross the line when commenting will be banned from commenting for a fixed period, and their accounts permanently banned if they persist.</li><li>Ever since launch, we have progressively improved the moderation tools that our members have at their disposal. When you block a member, all their comments on your reviews and lists are hidden for everyone. Your reviews and lists are your space; if you don’t want someone there, and they won’t leave, blocking will resolve this. We realize this doesn&rsquo;t make them go away; it just hides them from your space. We have work in progress to further improve the control content owners have over their comment threads.</li><li>Real talk: we acknowledge that some content flies under the radar of our community policy; the kind of content that is not overtly abusive, yet feels harassy. You know the type, we know the type. We need to get better at this.</li><li>Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you feel we’ve missed the mark on any of the above. We know you won’t!</li><li>Should you wish to be considered for our moderation team, please <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/contact/\">send us a note</a> explaining why you’d be great (don’t forget to include a link to your profile).</li></ul>"

Every cut reveals a wonderful new, immaculately composed shot.” </p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>Can you talk about when and how you got the inspiration for the premise of <i>The Mountain</i> and why you felt now was the right time to make this film?<br/></b><i>Rick Alverson</i>: I’ve had an interest that I’ve explored since <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-comedy/\">The Comedy</a></i> and <i>Entertainment</i> where I’m trying to comprehend what fuels this blind propulsion of American progress in today’s political climate, where we’re romanticizing the white male privilege era of the 1950s.</p><p>It’s also something often romanticized in American cinema; if not in its subject matter, then it’s romanticized in its formal depiction. I wanted to take that on and watch it deflate and see how it would hold up to a more nuanced and muddy immersion of the era.</p><p><b>You’ve described the film as anti-utopian. Do you think nostalgia is a dangerous thing?<br/></b>Nostalgia is definitely a very rich intoxicant that’s difficult to pull oneself away from. Commercial American cinema peddles almost entirely on those triggers of compartmentalized representation and clean—marginally pornographic—singular dimensions. I find that troubling to some degree because it pretends to be something else.</p><p><b>The remake of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lion-king-2019/\"><i>The Lion King</i></a> kinda sums that up.<br/></b>[Chuckles] Yeah.</p><p><b>Toxic masculinity has been central to many of your films and it’s in many ways the enemy of the moment right now. You’ve been ahead of the game in a way. Is that always your starting point? What influenced you to focus on men at their worst?<br/></b>I was raised at a time with influences that come from particular periods so there was a binary presentation of masculinity and I think it’s something that men are mired in. That has been problematic for men in a way that stripped away the wholeness of an individual.</p><p>Frailty, or a nuance of communication, hadn’t been as accessible to a generation of men, and that crippled them in a way which inflamed the damage that they did in their privileged space and [for] everyone around them. It’s a cyclone. In my demographic, we have been exposed to that, caught in it, and wrestled with it. Maybe that’s why I look at it so much.</p><p>I find failure in masculinity fascinating, too. The problematic American ‘wandering cinema’ of the 1970s is what made me want to do what I do. It’s the great unsung song of cinema that fell out of favor by the 1980s.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>As a working American filmmaker, do you feel it’s your social responsibility to use your medium to comment on and expose what you’re seeing happening in this country? Is this your version of political activism?<br/></b>[Laughs] Maybe. I think that there needs to be a politics of form. It’s the responsibility of filmmakers to not be ignorant of this gesture and what it does to the population. There’s a responsibility of cinema to ask itself some very hard questions before it ends up wrapping into total irrelevancy. What is narrative? What value does it have? How is it destructive? How is it being used for destruction? Is it functional anymore? I think that a lot of consumer cinema doesn’t ask those questions because it’s afraid to expose its vulnerabilities or its potential irrelevance.</p><p><b>How did your experience with <i>Entertainment</i> affect your approach to <i>The Mountain</i>?<br/></b><i>Entertainment</i> was the first film that played with cinematic influences that I had. It played with things that kind of grossed me out in cinema, with the defaults of metaphors and symbolism to create false profundities.</p><p>With <i>The Comedy,</i> I was focusing on a subset of class privilege in nuclear centers like New York City that I find reprehensible. I wanted to engage with it, investigate how to understand it, and make myself uncomfortable. Suddenly the medium felt a little more vital to me. It wasn’t just a propagandistic grandstanding, where essentially I would be showing off my likes and dislikes. I try to play a cat-and-mouse game with my own comfort and hopefully the audience finds some vitality in that.</p><p><b>Your last two films have felt very surreal, stylistically. They’re more lush yet still quite detached. What’s compelling you to stray from the slice-of-life realism you were using with your first few films?<br/></b>I had always wanted to have a career working with non-actors, but as I’ve gradually become more interested in the problems that make me uncomfortable I find myself engaging with them head-on, instead of just ignoring them for my comfort zone. The unreality of cinema has also become increasingly interesting to me.</p><p>There are some obsessive-compulsive approaches I took in <i>The Mountain</i>, which viewers might not see off-hand, that sort of heighten that falseness. Nobody leaves or enters the frame unless they go through a door. I’ve padded and loaded the film with limitations and, if I have any value now, my responsibility lies in nurturing the limitations of cinema and making them apparent.</p><p>For a long time we’ve been living in a fantasy land of unlimited potential and an abundance of opportunity, but the fact of the matter is we’ve been ignoring the beauty of the finite quality of the world. I think the same thing goes for cinema.</p><p><b>You’ve mentioned before that you don’t usually stick to a script but you did this time, though obviously the film utilizes a lot of long pauses and still imagery. Do you map out this sense of pacing in the script, or is there an element of you finding the film in the editing suite? How important is the sense of discovery in post for you?<br/></b>Editing the movie is incremental in its own way. But for me, the film really becomes alive during production and I find the pacing there. As far as mapping out those things in the script goes, it’s an obligation that I find tedious sometimes. My scripts used to be very short but they’re longer now because they’re a little bit more traditional on the page.</p><p>I do relish the moment when something isn’t satisfying our expectations. There’s a very exciting moment there when you let the comfort of distance go on too long. If you curtail it in the right way, it’s like surfing.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>This is a reunion between you and Tye Sheridan. He’s grown a lot since <i>Entertainment</i>, very literally too.<br/></b>Yeah, at least 4 or 5 inches.</p><p><b>Was he your first choice for the role? How did he contribute to the film beyond what you and your co-writers had on the page?<br/></b>He was my first choice and we developed the film together. It was an idea I brought to him when <i>Entertainment</i> wrapped. I talked to him about playing a ‘black hole’—something neutral at the centre of everything—that the whole world would move around.</p><p>He has a tremendous amount of patience and generosity. He’s very disciplined and we had a lot of fun subverting some of his capacities for empathy and fragility as an actor to make him inaccessible. That was a mission statement for us.</p><p><b>His character is very literally an audience surrogate. He’s passive, then he becomes pacified. I’m wondering what that says about what you think of your own audience? Do you feel unheard and misunderstood?<br/></b>It’s hard to say. I guess we’re interested in the reception of the film because I do want to engage an audience and there’re all sort of experiments in flirtation of audience expectations—in a constructive sense, I hope.</p><p>I do think that audiences have been conditioned to prefer pacificity and media as an anesthesia. I’m trying in my little way to interrupt that. Maybe I’m just having a fit in the corner of the room, I don’t know.</p><p><b>So how did Jeff Goldblum come on board? I was very surprised to see him attached to one of your films, unless I’m underestimating his taste in modern arthouse cinema.<br/></b>He’s getting in the mud of it all. He’s up for anything these days. I think he’s having not just a popularity revival but a revival of his artistic interests. Jeff has a tremendous amount of vitality and he was very interested in causing a small trouble with me.</p><p><!--figure[4]--><small><i>Director Rick Alverson.</i></small></p><p><i></i></p><p><b>In what way?<br/></b>He wanted to subvert expectations of the audiences of how they’ve considered him and what he does for them and we utilized that. He’s really keen and smart and I think he understood that it could have a potency in the film. This is one of his more muted performances, even though the personality of Goldblum percolates out of that. He restrained himself in a way I found really refreshing.</p><p><b>We really want to commend your location scout on a fantastic job. What were you looking for in the production design and the sets? Especially for the final shot.<br/></b>The final shot was its own kind of nightmare. We shot that on Mount Baker on the Canadian border in Washington and we isolated the location based on this expanse that’s usually full of four or five feet of snow most of the year. The night before we shot, they plowed all that snow for the parking lot underneath. Those sorts of things drive you crazy.</p><p>My production designer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/production-design/jacqueline-abrahams/\">Jacqueline Abrahams</a>—who worked on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lobster/\"><i>The Lobster</i></a> among other great films—is an incredibly keen, hardworking person. We wanted to neuter some of the romance of the era, to make it muddy and give it a bland complexity. Obviously when making a period film, the production design and costume design are the most difficult but nerve-wrecking and exciting tools in the whole toolbox. I think we came at it obliquely enough that it became interesting.</p><p><b>Are you still hoping to make your <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2012/11/interview-the-comedy-director-rick-alverson-on-provoking-audiences-and-why-his-next-movie-is-about-the-ku-klux-klan-43537/\">KKK film</a> soon? Now should be the time, right?<br/></b>I’d like to move back to it, but I’ve moved onto another project for now [a horror movie and a comedy series, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-mountain-interview-rick-alverson-jeff-goldblum-1202161333/\">according to IndieWire</a>]. It still fascinates me, but I don’t want to be too reactionary. It’s a tough time now, for a lot of things.</p><p><b>Would you say you’re drawn to films similar to yours? What are your favorite recent films that challenged you?<br/></b>Oh gosh. The other day I saw <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/slack-bay/\"><i>Slack Bay</i></a> by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/bruno-dumont/\">Bruno Dumont</a>, which I found very funny. I’m sorry, I’m terrible at this question.</p><p><b>I’d say that’s a very on-brand choice for you. Thank you.</b></p>"

The following year, Shelton directed the first two episodes of the fourth and final season of the IFC series <i>Maron</i> (she also had an on-screen role in episode 11), and in 2017, she directed Maron’s Netflix special, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/marc-maron-too-real/\"><i>Too Real</i></a>. He is, it turns out, not only the star, but also the muse for <i>Sword of Trust</i>. “Since the first time I worked with him, I felt he had untapped depth that I wanted the world to see on-screen.”</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>What inspired the premise of <i>Sword of Trust</i>?<br/></b><i>Lynn Shelton:</i> [Marc and I] started writing a script for a different movie but it was hard to make progress on it because we’re both so busy. I was getting frustrated since I wanted to get on set with him, until he told me he would show up for any part I wrote for him. For <i>Sword of Trust</i>, I was inspired by seeing a pawn shop and thinking he would be a great pawn shop owner and that it would be a great place for a narrative to unfold.</p><p>I knew that I wanted to give myself the opportunity to explore a new genre and do a screwball caper. It would be emotionally grounded and have authentic characters who resonated as real people, but goes on a misadventure; a comedy that allows itself to go into slightly unrealistic territories. That was something I’ve never allowed myself to do. Before this I always wanted to make sure that every single minute was completely realistic.</p><p>I wanted to let myself have a bit of fun. I also wanted to return to improvisation, which I haven’t really done since <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/your-sisters-sister/\"><i>Your Sister’s Sister</i></a>, which was nearly ten years ago. I was excited to return to that territory and I started to assemble a cast of people I knew that would be really good at improvising around Marc.</p><p>Lastly, I really wanted it to involve some sort of a con that was relevant to what’s going on in our cultural political situation. One thing I’ve been obsessed with right now is this peak moment we’re having in society of conspiracy theories and the idea of alternative facts. I wanted to make a film that would point it out, but also one that wouldn’t make you want to slit your wrists as you walk out of the theater. That’s where the whole conspiracy theory premise came from.</p><p><b>When you direct with improvisation, what structures do you have in place to ensure you and the cast keep the characters and the story consistent, yet also make sure you stick to the schedule?<br/></b>I built those characters with and for the actors, especially Marc’s character Mel. With improvisation in general, it’s important to have clear back-stories and relationships between the characters going in, even weeks before you arrive on set. I asked the actors to get together with the people they were supposed to have relationships with to get the wheels turning about who these people were. By the time we got there they were able to start spinning out some sort of narrative that reflected all of that work we put into their back-stories.</p><p>This is a very plot-heavy movie, which was tightly pre-constructed, so it wasn’t the kind of improvisational movie where you show up and wonder ‘what will happen to these people today?’. I knew exactly what had to happen in each scene to map out into the final narrative. In this case we had a 50-page scriptment, where some scenes are written out in terms of dialogue but actors were always free to toss the specific words out the window and come up with their own replacements. There’s a lot of room for embellishments or improvised little side roads.</p><p>There’s a moment I always think of: when Jillian Bell picks up a sale item she was inspired by in the pawn shop we were shooting at and she created a whole little funny side thing about it. People are inspired by the environment they’re in and something will just come out of their mouths and they’ll just go down that road. It’s a beautiful thing.</p><p>I ask them to do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of getting some exposition out while planting seeds, but outside of that they can really play and have the freedom to find their own way through the beats of the scene and add their own little grace notes to how the scene plays out.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Did anything significantly change between the initial treatment and final film? How does it transform on set from the core essence of what you have on the page?<br/></b>There were a couple scenes that ended up getting thrown out on the cutting-room floor after we had a few feedback screenings. We had multiple endings and we got rid of a lot of them, which didn’t seem to hurt the film at all. We also had some great scenes that were added along the way. Halfway through the shoot we had a little break and Marc suggested a new scene that helped round out a couple of the side characters that we hadn’t gotten a chance to get to know very well.</p><p>I had planned for the confederate thug characters (who try to get the sword from Mel in the pawn shop) to turn up again later when the four characters are at the farm, but it was Marc’s idea for Mel to recognise them from when they were kids and embarrass them about how they would come into his shop when they were younger. It’s a tragic story Marc paints about them and it really shifts your perception of these two bozos and gives you a sense of sympathy for them even while they’re trying to be tough guys.</p><p>I love when you can take a couple of characters who seem to initially be two-dimensional and then you find out some extra facts about them and you’re able to turn them into fully fleshed-out human beings, even if they don’t get a lot of screen time. It’s a wonderful thing to humanize characters like that.</p><p>The scene in the back of the van—which I think is really the heart of the movie—also developed over time. In the script itself it just said: “they get to know each other in the back of the van.” That’s all it said. That was the most fully improvised scene in the film. I left it open-ended because I had a feeling it would fulfil a really important role in the movie but I didn’t know exactly what it was until we got going.</p><p>It became clear there was an emotional journey with Mel as he starts out very shut-down and he opens up a little bit by the end. I realized this scene needed to be used in the service of that arc, so I told the actors that I needed them to open up to each other and be vulnerable to each other so the characters could become more intimate. A lot of the time they drew from real life, drawing from first- or second-hand experiences to build those back-stories.</p><p><b>You’ve settled into a real groove with directing television. Your resume in that area is really impressive. What keeps you circling back to film when you could keep making a career out of being a TV director?<br/></b>Most of my income is from television and I really enjoy the extra-collaborative nature of television. It’s almost a pathology with filmmaking—I can’t stop doing it! This is my eighth movie and I just love it so much. I love the little family you develop. Obviously there’s a lot of overlap in the process of making film and television since it’s basically the same thing, but when I’m writing and directing I have more of an opportunity to set the tone and really create from the top-down of what I want the culture of the production to be like.</p><p>I can be the creative visionary in a way that, until I create my own television show, is not going to be possible. If I’m the director on a show, I’m ultimately in the service of other people. Luckily, I keep working with really visionary and talented people. This film, I sort of willed it into existence and it’s nice. I really wanted it to happen, so I asked a bunch of friends if they would join me, and it ended up becoming reality and there’s something really lovely about that.</p><p><b>Your last two films and your Marc Maron stand-up special are on Netflix. Anyone can (and should) watch them at any time, and streaming has completely transformed indie cinema in this way over the past decade. Yet, there are so many films that they can all still get lost in the shuffle. How do you feel about the way streaming has changed low-budget cinema? What work needs to be done to support them?<br/></b>This is a constant topic of conversation between filmmaker friends of mine. I know a lot of friends who were able to get films made that wouldn’t have been able to if not for Netflix, for instance. I don’t know if that’s even going to continue being the case because they seem to be shifting their paradigm in the kinds of films they’re producing, but for a while there they were almost the last bastion of producing films of a certain size that weren’t just giant tentpole movies.</p><p>Obviously films are still being made, little- to medium-sized films, but the issue of them getting lost in the shuffle because of this vast ocean of content that’s out there—unless you have this big machine waving flags to say: “look at this over here”—they will continue to disappear into the ether. It can be disheartening for sure.</p><p>My last film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/outside-in-2017/\"><i>Outside In</i></a> [one of Shelton’s more highly rated films on Letterboxd] had a very tiny theatrical run and basically went straight to Netflix, so I don’t really have any sense of who is seeing the film. But it’s interesting how I do have people reaching out to me saying they didn’t know I directed it but watched it because of Edie Falco, or they were recommended it. People do seem to see the movie, I just don’t know exactly what the numbers are. You just don’t know, so it’s a very strange feeling.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s very nice that it’s accessible and it can be discovered. If I wanted to point somebody to one of my films on Netflix, I know they can easily access it anytime. Streaming is a real mixed bag for independent filmmakers. Right now I have about 30 theaters showing <i>Sword of Trust</i> and I’m so thrilled that even if it’s just a weekend, at least a good chunk of folks will be able to see the film and have the communal experience the way I wanted in the first place.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Finally, a favorite Letterboxd question: what was the film that got you into films?<br/></b>I could go to different points in my life. My mother was a huge fan of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jules-and-jim/\"><i>Jules et Jim</i></a> so I saw that at a really early age and it had a big effect on me. It was the first time where I was ever aware of the filmmaker’s hand. I never started thinking about it until the one sequence where Jeanne Moreau is singing and it freezes and then it plays and then it freezes again and then it plays again and it made me realize there was a director who made that decision to do that. What does that mean? That got me thinking about filmmaking when I was really young.</p><p>Then later in life I heard Claire Denis speak when her film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/friday-night/\"><i>Friday Night</i></a> was coming out. I remember finding out that she was 40 when she made her first feature and <i>Friday Night</i> was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/claire-denis/\">her sixth or seventh film</a>. I had an epiphany that I could start making movies and it wasn’t too late for me because I didn’t make movies in my 20s and 30s. I didn’t make my first feature [<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/we-go-way-back/\"><i>We Go Way Back</i></a>] until my late 30s. That was the film and filmmaker that really made me feel like ‘I can do this too’. Those would be my two bookends about being inspired to be a filmmaker.</p>"

Childish Gambino) voice the youthful and adult versions of Simba the lion, respectively, opposite Shahadi Wright Joseph (the daughter from <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/us-2019/\">Us</a></i>) and Beyoncé as Simba’s best friend Nala. Joseph played the same role in the long-running Broadway adaptation of <i>The Lion King</i>, from which the new film takes some musical and aesthetic cues.</p><p>Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/doctor-strange-2016/\">Doctor Strange</a></i>) replaces Jeremy Irons in the role of Scar, and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader himself) returns to the role of Mufasa.</p><p>Ugandan-born, German-raised actor Florence Kasumba (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/black-panther-2018/\">Black Panther</a></i>)—who also appeared in the stage version of <i>The Lion King</i>—plays head hyena Shenzi, alongside Keegan-Michael Key (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-predator/\">The Predator</a></i>) and Eric André (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rough-night/\">Rough Night</a></i>) as bickering hyena minons Kamari and Azizi.</p><p>Key and André are pretty great, but the comedic pairing in the film that is getting talked about a lot is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner as warthog Pumba and meerkat Timon. Both are utterly hilarious.</p><p>Favreau recently got together with most of the cast (no Beyoncé, sadly) and some select press in Beverly Hills to discuss the making of the film.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>On how working on <i>The Jungle Book</i> flowed into <i>The Lion King</i>:</b><br/><i>Jon Favreau (director/producer):</i> I’ve been working on both these movies back to back for about six years. All the new technology that was available, I had finally learned how to use it by the end of <i>Jungle Book</i>. And at that point, with the team that we had assembled for it, all the artists. Because a lot of attention is paid to the technology, but really, these are handmade films. There are animators working on every shot, every environment that you see in the film—actually, there’s one shot that’s a real photographic shot—but everything else is built from scratch by artists. And we had a great team assembled. And then the idea of using what we learned on that and the new technologies that were available to make a story like <i>Lion King </i>with its great music, great characters, and great story, it seemed like a wonderful, logical conclusion. And so that was something we set out to do.</p><p><b>On how digital production evolved in the new film:<br/></b><i>JF:</i><b> </b>In <i>Jungle Book</i>, we were essentially using the same motion-capture technology for performers and cameras as had been developed ten years prior for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/avatar/\">Avatar</a></i>. But towards the end of that, there was a whole slew of consumer-facing VR products that were hitting the scene. We started experimenting with it at the end of <i>Jungle Book</i> and realized that we could build this really cool system of filmmaking using game-engine technology. That way I could bring in people who don’t have any background in visual effects. We would design the entire environments. We took all the recordings that we had from the actors. We would animate within the game engine, in this case, it was Unity. And the crew would be able to put on the headsets, go in, scout, and actually set cameras within VR.</p><p>The effort here was to keep not just the tradition of the film and stage production that came before us, but the filmmaking tradition. Oftentimes when new technology comes online, it disrupts an industry. But with just a little bit of effort, we were able to build around the way filmmakers and film crews work. So a guy like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/caleb-deschanel/\">Caleb Deschanel</a>, a fantastic cinematographer who I’ve always wanted to work with, inviting him to do a very technically advanced film without any prior background in visual effects and just saying: hey, we’ll make it so that you could just make a movie as you would have made <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-black-stallion/\">The Black Stallion</a></i>. We would actually have cameras driven in VR space by a film crew with dollies and cranes and assistant directors, script supervisors, set dressers. So we kept the same film culture and planted it using this technology into the VR realm.</p><p>Although the film was completely animated as far as performances went, it allowed a live-action film crew to go in and use the tools they were used to. Part of what’s so beautiful about the lighting, the camera work, the shots of the film, was that we were able to inherit a whole career of experience and artistry from our fantastic team. I think that it’s nice to look at technology as an invitation for things to progress and not always something that’s going to change the way everything came before it. I think there’s a balance between innovation and tradition.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On what excited him about the story:</b><br/><i>Donald Glover (adult Simba): </i>Jon was really good about the circle of life having a major hand in it. I really feel that it’s good to make movies that are global and metropolitan in the sense [that we are] the citizens of the world. Like, making sure that we talk about how connected we are right now. Because it’s the first time we’ve really been able to talk to everybody at the same time. It was just, like, a necessary thing.</p><p><b>On getting into Scar’s head:<br/></b><i>Chiwetel Ejiofor (Scar):</i> I felt that it was just really interesting to go into that psychology, to really try and uncover that and to look at it. I’m a huge fan of what was done before, obviously, like everybody else—Jeremy Irons—and just going back in and exploring that character again from a slightly different perspective and seeing what was there.</p><p>It’s such an incredible part to play; so complex and all of that. Having empathy—not sympathy—but empathizing with the character and trying to understand them and trying to get underneath that. And such a rich, villainous character to play. In a way as much as I—absolutely with everybody else—loved the original, you kind of make it your own and you create the sort of individuality to it in that way.</p><p><b>On finding a loose comedic rhythm in a digital context:<br/></b><i>Seth Rogen (Pumba):</i> It was a lot of improvisation with Billy. We were actually together every time we recorded, which is a very rare gift to have as someone who is trying to be funny in an animated film, of which I’ve done a lot, and you’re often just alone in there. I think you can really tell that we’re playing off of each other. It’s an incredibly naturalistic feeling. They really captured Billy. That is what is amazing, I would say. He essentially played himself on a TV show for years, and this character is more Billy than that character somehow. It’s remarkable to me how his character specifically makes me laugh so hard.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><i>Billy Eichner (Timon): </i>I wish I was as cute in real life as I am in the movie. The Timon they designed is so adorable, and I think the juxtaposition of my personality in that little Timon body really works. And yeah. I agree with everything that Seth was saying. I can’t imagine now, looking back, not being in the room together. Being able to riff off each other and really discover our chemistry together in the same moment. You can feel it when you’re watching the movie. I had not seen the finished movie until last night and I was shocked by how much of the riffing actually ended up in the movie. I think it works. I think it feels very unique to other movies in this genre, which can often feel a bit canned.</p><p><i>SR:</i> The fact that it has a looseness applied to probably the most technologically incredible movie ever made is an amazing contrast. It feels like people in a room just talking, and then it’s refined to a degree that is inconceivable in a lot of ways. That mixture is what I think is so incredible and that’s what Jon really captured in an amazing way.</p><p><b>On how Favreau guided their tone:<br/></b><i>Eric André (Kamari):</i> He’s incredibly talented and really, really easy to work off of. And he is a selfless altruistic talent, which is rare. So I was in great hands with Jon. It was just a very nurturing environment and made it very easy, because I’m very, very sensitive. So the slightest wind of anything will make me tear up.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i>Keegan-Michael Key (Azizi):</i> I think Jon is a great student, has an encyclopaedic knowledge of all different types of comedy. One of those pieces of knowledge is about comedic duos and the dynamic that exists between them. We had a very similar experience to Billy and Seth where we were allowed to walk around the room. It was as if we were being directed in a scene in the play. And as you said, we were all mic’d, and so everything was captured.</p><p>It was the subsequent rounds that I thought [were] interesting. Jon would get a little more technical, when I would be actually by myself. The refinement is also very fun, because we would sit there and I would have the headphones on. I would say to Jon, “We’re looking for Fibber McGee and Molly here or Abbott and Costello. What are you looking for?” He goes, “I’m actually looking for a little bit of Laurel and Hardy with an explosion at the end, but then back it up into little Apatowian for me.”</p><p><i>EA</i>: With a sprinkle of Beavis and Butthead.</p><p><b>On the experience of going from the stage version to the film version:<br/></b><i>Florence Kasumba (Shenzi): </i>I was lucky that I got to play the part already in Germany for more than a year. We played like eight shows a week. So Shenzi is like muscle memory, because I got to play her every day. But this Shenzi is so different. I remember in the musical, we had sometimes shows where I was embarrassed because the hyenas are so dumb and funny. They <i>are </i>entertaining, but this is so different, this experience, because when I listen to the dialogue, when I read them, I realized that this is way more dangerous and more serious.</p><p>I was lucky [on] my first day that I was in a black box and I was working with Eric André, and with JD. We were very physical, because the guys were so strong, it was easy for me to just be big. Because everybody is very confident, we could just really try out things. We could walk around each other. We could scare each other. We could scream, be loud, be big, be small. It’s like working in the theater, which I love. Having that freedom just made me… I was allowed to do whatever I wanted to.</p>"

Ever the optimists, you pitched us well over a hundred, so <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/\">Jack Moulton</a> got the tough job: whittling, coalescing and combining your thoughts, tucking them in among a few of our own, and putting them to a guy who has <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/hereditary-ari-aster-interview-inspiration-history-1201972348/\">“more fun talking about other movies than talking about my own”</a>.</p><p>One thing we didn’t ask? The most popular question of all: “Ari, are you okay?” The better question, after watching his films, is: are <i>we</i> okay?</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>You wrote both <i>Hereditary</i> and <i>Midsommar</i> while you were in a personal crisis, and you consider that writing was your remedy. Do you think you can make great art—to explore the depths of existential questions—when you’re more comfortable and content? Or is suffering the root of your success?<br/></b><i>Ari Aster:</i> I’m sure I can. I’ve written a lot of films when I’ve been more comfortable and content. The two short films that I made first were written in that place. I’m a filmmaker who likes conflict, which is not unique to me of course, but I do have a dark side and I go there in my writing.</p><p>I’m also someone who believes the best filmmaking is mischief-making and I’m always trying to come from a place of mischief as a writer. But, whether I’m going through a crisis or writing in a more or less relaxed state, I’m also a very neurotic guy. Even when there’s relative peace in my life, I’m kind of a nervous wreck.</p><p><b>That’s relatable. Grief is a catalyst for both films, and both Toni Collette and Florence Pugh’s big scenes of anguish are really the most horrifying parts of the films, because they’re so raw. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/alecdouglas/\">AlecDouglas</a> asks: what is your approach to directing actors’ performances? More specifically, can you talk about how you prepared each actress for these gut-wrenching moments.<br/></b>A lot of that was laid out in the script as clearly as I could. Beyond the script, it was just a matter of talking through the material with them and explaining what I felt was needed. Luckily both actresses are extraordinary artists who knew exactly what was necessary and were fully committed. They gave themselves to the material in a very generous way and were prepared to dive in headlong.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Filmsbychrisf/status/1148877369257521152\">Chris Flores</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CreoWorks/status/1150037236915814400\">Timur Dzhambinov</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KahlenBurgwin/status/1148890289471229952\">Kahlen</a> all asked about your obsession with mutilated heads and/or skull trauma.<br/></b>I grew up loving horror films and subjected myself to a lot of grotesque imagery. I’ve always had a feeling for the macabre. There are a lot of images that traumatized me and I’m sure that they lingered in my mind in a way that conditioned me to pursue images like that and come up with them myself. In all of my stories, the imagery comes after the ideas and characters, so it tends to fall in line with the story. In some cases it does come first, but it’s very hard to trace any of that to any origin.</p><p><b>Several people, including <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mgreco2591/\">Mark</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mrjoshua/\">MrJoshua</a>, would like to know how many of the pagan rituals and artwork in <i>Midsommar</i> are legitimate, and how many were invented by you.<br/></b>Most of the rituals are references in one way or another to actual traditions and laid out in pre-existing folklore, but I did take a lot of liberties from there. So there are certain things in the film that are pure invention and there’s certain things that are absolutely pulled from reality. The pubic hair in the food and the menstrual blood in the drink, for instance, is tied to my actual research.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/derfel/\">Scott Stamper</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/samsellers/\">Sam Sellers-King</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/heteroash/\">Ash</a> were interested in your obsession with cults, or, as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/djannadhiya/\">Deryn</a> asks: “Ari Aster <i>what the fuc</i>— okay, what is it with you and pagan cult-themed horror movies?”<br/></b>I don’t know if I have an obsession. It just so happens that the first two movies that I got made featured cults. They’re also both films that are very much about family and are asking questions about the families you’re born into, surrogate families, and the families you find. So for both films it made sense. A cult is a very useful metaphor when you’re digging into material.</p><p><b>Another common question: how much “research”—personal or professional—did you do into psychedelic drugs?<br/></b>When it comes to the psychedelic stuff, I didn’t really do research. I had taken psychedelics about ten years ago and I had some very bad trips when I was in college.</p><p><b>That counts as research.<br/></b>Inadvertently, yeah.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/filmsaremything/\">Laura Valentina</a> asks: which films inspired the look and feel of <i>Midsommar</i>? Can we ask you to also talk about cinematography influences?<br/></b>For the tripping scenes, we weren’t looking at any influences. We didn’t want to do the 1960s and 1970s psychedelia that you might see in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/easy-rider/\">Easy Rider</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/midnight-cowboy/\">Midnight Cowboy</a></i>, or the films by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/kenneth-anger/\">Kenneth Anger</a>. I love all those films and really enjoy them, but they’re dated due to that. If anything we just knew what we wanted to avoid.</p><p>For the cinematography in general, we were pursuing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor#Three-strip_Technicolor\">three-strip Technicolor</a> look. We were talking a lot about the color films of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/michael-powell/\">Powell</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/emeric-pressburger/\">Pressburger</a> and looking at older movies when we were color-correcting the film. When I was finishing <i>Hereditary</i>, I was working on a shot-list [for <i>Midsommar</i>], but it was a more accelerated process <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/ari-aster-midsommar-interview.html\">because of our extremely punishing and tight prep schedule</a>. On <i>Hereditary</i> we did a lot of screenings for the crew of given movies that I thought would get people in the right mood, but we weren’t able to do that on this film.</p><p><b>You’ve mentioned this was a gruelling shoot on a tight timeframe, but <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/marielagv/\">Mariela</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ninetailedfox/\">NineTailedFox</a> would like to know what the most satisfying part of the production of <i>Midsommar</i> was for you?<br/></b>It’s always satisfying when you have a good scene in the can and when you’re able to achieve certain things. Everyday there’s satisfying moments but it’s also loaded with little disappointments. You’re just always praying for something that will help move the shoot along and keep people’s spirits high. There were a lot of scenes that we were happy with so that’s always something to be grateful about.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nickbigoni/\">Many</a> in the Letterboxd community are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LewisIsTWEETING/status/1148945783150055424\">raving</a> about <i>Midsommar</i>’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/k8sfilm/\">stellar cast</a>. Half the character work is achieved in those selections. Can you talk about where you first saw your actors and how you knew they were right for the roles?<br/></b>For a lot of the parts we had people tape and send in auditions, so it’s really a matter of instinct and feeling these people fit. In the case of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/florence-pugh/\">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/jack-reynor/\">Jack Reynor</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/will-poulter/\">Will Poulter</a>, they were people who were at the top of our lists early on who we persisted on that they were right. It was a real joy to work with all of them. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/william-jackson-harper/\">William Jackson Harper</a>, too.</p><p>Florence Pugh can really do anything. She’s an incredible actress who’s wonderfully endowed with amazing talent. Will Poulter is a total professional and a brilliant actor. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/vilhelm-blomgren/\">Vilhelm Blomgren</a> was somebody we pulled on pretty late in the process and it was very exciting to find him and know we had our Pelle.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alteredliszt\">Bran</a> asks: how different did <i>Hereditary</i> and <i>Midsommar</i> end up being from your initial ideas for them?<br/></b>They changed in the sense that what we ended up shooting were a lot longer than we could keep them, so the movies were cut down a lot. I feel both films are pretty close to what I was imagining. <i>Midsommar</i> was more ambitious and so there were more compromises, which is just what happens. You’re chasing this thing and you get as close as you can to your vision.</p><p><b>So then, given that <i>Midsommar</i> was significantly cut down, we’ll jump to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ruffreader/\">Joshua Booker</a>’s question: what was the hardest stuff to cut?<br/></b>There’s more rituals and we get to meet more people in the community to get a more nuanced view of them. There are more scenes between Dani and Christian so that their journey to that ending is a little bit more circuitous. There’s more of the thesis competition between Christian and Josh too, that originally had more body to it.</p><p><b>Right out of the gate your vision as a filmmaker feels fully formed. You’ve said that you intend to explore different genres. Do you want to continue working with cinematographer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/pawel-pogorzelski/\">Pawel Pogorzelski</a>, and do you plan on exploring different styles?<br/></b>I’m always interested in developing different styles but the style needs to fit the film. I’ve been working with Pawel for a long time—he’s one of my best friends and we understand how the other person works. We have a very satisfying shorthand and our own processes, which is great. I definitely plan on keeping on going with him.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sakshatkc/\">Everybody</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/micah424/\">wants</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamNational/status/1148786223860899841\">know</a> whether you’ve ever written a script, or a scene, or a short, and then thought “I’ve gone too far”?<br/></b>I admit have a problem with brevity. That’s maybe where I wonder if I’ve been a bit too indulgent, but not if I’ve gone too far with the taboos.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/maxt26/\">MaxT26</a> asks: do you think it’s important for modern horror films to push the boundaries in terms of being disturbing and creative? Related: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tobiassoar/\">Tobias Soar</a> wonders what recent horror movies you’ve admired.<br/></b>There’s a tradition in horror of confronting taboos and twisting the knife, so to speak. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wailing/\"><i>The Wailing</i></a> is a film I absolutely loved and already has a place among my favorite horror movies. I would describe that as a masterpiece.</p><p>I’m excited by South Korean filmmakers in general, by the way they approach storytelling and juggling of tones. Their films defy categorization while also tempting it. Later this year, we’re all going to get <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/\"><i>The Lighthouse</i></a>. I wouldn’t necessarily categorize that as a horror film but I’m excited for people to see it. I’m a big fan of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/robert-eggers/\">Robert Eggers</a>. I saw an early cut of it and it’s great.</p><p><i>The final question/answer contain spoilers for both films. Read on at your peril.</i></p><p><b>You’ve mentioned building the script for <i>Hereditary</i> around the image of both Charlie and Annie’s deaths and the way they mirror each other. What image was your starting point for <i>Midsommar</i>?<br/></b>Some of the final images were certainly the things that came to me first. In particular, it was the image of the wide-shot with Dani and the house burning behind her. The prologue of the film came to me pretty early on too.</p>"

What would happen if I got mugged? What would happen if I was with somebody I loved and something happened and I couldn’t defend them? And I just really didn’t know the answers to those questions. So I started looking into taking martial arts classes, and jiu-jitsu in particular is what I settled on. It was really out of fear initially, and now I do jiu-jitsu because it’s fun. It’s a hobby, it’s a sport that I like and it keeps me in shape. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done for myself, but it really started out of fear.</p><p>When I started writing the movie, I’d been doing jiu-jitsu for a little while. I wanted to make a movie in that world, but I realized I could take my experience and my fear and put it into the story, and I thought people might relate to that. And the really interesting thing is some of the guys I’ve shown it to have felt like they saw themselves in the character, even though for me, it’s a stylized and exaggerated version of myself. I see myself in the character, obviously, but I feel proud that they see themselves too.</p><p><b>Is this film’s time period deliberately ambiguous?</b><br/>Deliberately ambiguous, yes. I wanted to kind of be able to just mix technology. I happen to think that analog technology is more interesting-looking, and it adds a certain production design quality to the film that I really like. I don’t want people to have to think about the timeline too much. If you’re thinking ‘why is it ambiguous?’ that’s one thing. But thinking ‘oh there’s an iPhone 7, so this happened at that time’, I think it dates a film unnecessarily. I also try to stay away from cellphones just in general too. Because if you don’t have ’em and they’re never touched on, then you can’t use them, and that’s great, because it helps propel story. But yeah, it’s definitely an ambiguous timeline.<br/></p><p><b>Having said that, <b>your film delves into a subject</b> that there’s so much discussion around right now in society: masculinity (and toxic forms of it). Is that a coincidence?<br/></b>I started writing this in 2015. I think the conversations were happening then, it was just a smaller version. Recently it has really picked up, [with] the #MeToo movement, and there’s people questioning and saying ‘no we’re not gonna take this anymore’. I think that’s amazing, but this was already something I was looking at doing for myself. Just saying, like, I’m a white guy and I’m middle-aged and I grew up in a middle-class family and this is my perspective, and so this hopefully is how I can help. It’s karate and it’s got action and comedy and all that, but I do think there’s a message at the heart of it. At the end of the day, it’s entertainment, for sure, but I don’t want to make something that’s pure entertainment. I want to make something that says something, at least. That was my goal.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p> <b>The character of Sensei is really something else. What were your conversations with Alessandro Nivola like?<br/></b>For some reason I came up with this image that kind of started with Sensei: he’s the kind of guy who would wear sandals with socks. That’s who Sensei is. He’s a sociopathic character in the film, but he also is just a dork, too. I think he was the kid who was beat up in high school, probably started taking karate to be able to defend himself, thought it would make him cool. And at the end of the day, karate’s not necessarily the coolest thing in the world anyway. Anybody putting on a gi, you don’t look cool doing it. What you’re able to do from the martial art is one thing, but you don’t look cool in the gi.</p><p>I think Sensei just wants to belong. He wanted to belong to a group, and no group would have him so he kind of started his own, so he’s got his school, all these students look up to him, and he’s just pretending to be the cool person he always wanted to be. And he also just happens to be kinda crazy too. But yet, Alessandro had fun being that guy, just embracing the quirks of the character and not going the expected route.</p><p><b>There’s a declarative, deadpan tone to this film. Did you talk to your cast about tone?<br/></b>Definitely. ‘Deadpan’ is a word that’s used, and I think I accidentally slip into it here and there, but I like to say ‘literal’. In real life, we kind of hide the truth a little bit to be nice or friendly, and we don’t always express exactly what we’re thinking. I like to think that in the world of <i>The Art of Self-Defense</i>, everyone says exactly what they’re thinking. It’s either black or white, there’s no gray. And I think that helps inform the acting at times. Just saying what you think, and also a lot of times with quote-unquote jokes in the movie, I don’t think they work as well if you play it as a joke. But if you don’t play it as a joke, you play it dead serious, that’s where the humor lies. And we were really able to find that on set.</p><p>It’s hard to say that it’s a natural-feeling film, but I didn’t want it to feel so stylized that it takes you out of it. I wanted you to feel like this is just maybe a dimension over from us, a minute shift, but it’s enough that it makes things feel slightly off but it gives it its own world. I like building worlds, even if it’s not in some grand <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/avatar/\">Avatar</a></i> kind of way. Just hone and feel an atmosphere.</p><p>For me, tone is the most important part of filmmaking. I would rather have a nailed-down tone. I don’t know that I’m ever gonna achieve that; it’s always gonna be a battle to figure out what is perfect, but that means more to me than doing some really cool camera move. Or having some big explosion or something. I look at the Coen brothers and I say, like: how are they able to do exactly what they want to do with every single movie, and how does it feel like a Coen brothers film for me every single time? That’s an aspirational thing for me down the line; I want to get to that point where I know exactly what I want, we’re able to achieve it every time, and everyone’s on the same page. Tone is fun. Tone is like a fingerprint. And I’m trying to figure out what mine is.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Violence is a big part of this film. Were you trying to approach violence in a specific way?<br/></b>Um, not necessarily. I think that our society, in the United States especially, nudity and sex is so “horrible” to put on film, but everything gets away with violence. And I think that to a certain extent, that’s not a great thing, but I do happen to find a certain style of violence… when it’s used in a certain context. The films of Yorgos Lanthimos or… who else…</p><p><b>Paul Verhoeven?<br/></b>Yes. There you go. Haneke. There are ways of approaching violence that don’t glorify it, and I do think that there is humor in violence, but I know at the end of the day I’m making a movie. In real life, I’m not a violent person. I don’t like violent things. But being able to explore it is interesting in the context of the film. Maybe it’s the shock of it. Maybe I’m just being clichéd or whatever. But I do happen to find [violence] an interesting tool to be able to use. There are moments in the movie where we show the violence and there’s moments where we have it off camera. And I think being able to decide that may be too much, or being able to say, this is just doing it for shock and not adding anything to the discussion.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Something I definitely did in conceiving the way that we shot it, anything with fists or feet, like punching, very analog fights, all of that could be very bloody. But the moment we used weapons or guns or anything, I wanted [scene description redacted to avoid spoilers] to be almost not bloody at all. I didn’t wanna glorify the gun violence. But with the karate side of it, we just went balls-to-the-wall. So there’s also a little bit of that too, knowingly adding more to certain elements that you want to enhance. I don’t think people need to <i>see</i> [scene description redacted]. That’s not entertainment to me.</p>"

This was an opportunity to undermine that cliché. Bautista playing the sort of Nick Nolte throwback character, and Kumail coming in to drop a grenade into that trope.</p><p><b>You don’t write a film like this without being a fan of action comedies. What did you learn about the genre that you maybe didn’t know before you decided to write your own?<br/></b><i>Tripper Clancy (screenwriter):</i> I learned that it all hinges on the central relationship. At some level, all movies do, but some people [focus on]: “What are the set pieces gonna be in an action comedy? What are the funny beats gonna be?” But at the end of the day, if the relationship doesn’t work…</p><p>I think that’s why I’m drawn to <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/midnight-run/\">Midnight Run</a></i> and <i>48 Hrs.</i> specifically, because those central relationships, they drive the whole movie. You can go on an adventure with those guys anywhere. So I wanted for Vic and for Stu, the two main characters, I wanted the audience [to be willing to] go on a ride anywhere with them that we took ’em.</p><p>You want to put them in weird places and you want them to learn from each other, but I think it’s hard to do, and even <i>Beverly Hills Cop </i>does it, but he’s kind of a lone wolf in that movie a lot of the time. <i>Lethal Weapon</i> is one of the all-time greats because those two guys, their relationship is what drives those movies.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>We haven’t seen many of these specifically ’80s-esque action comedies in a while. Is it a genre you think has the potential to come back?<br/></b><i>TC:</i> I hope so. I think the ’90s were not kind to the genre. I think they got a little bit goofy. And they kind of removed themselves from reality, just based on someone’s star power. But one of the things I love that the studio did on this movie is they didn’t go to the people that have done this a hundred times. For Dave, for Kumail, this is the first time they’re playing these kinds of roles, and I think there’s a freshness to that that the audience is really going to appreciate.</p><p><b>Yeah, action comedies got a bit family-friendly there for a while. But this is unashamedly R-rated.<br/></b><i>TC:</i> This is R-rated. It’s very violent. There’s a lot of blood. It’s not for kids. I’ve got two kids at home, they won’t see this for about ten more years, it’s fine with me. It’s edgy, it’s got some darkness to it, so I hope people appreciate that.</p><p>  <b>Was there an action comedy that really attracted you to the genre when you were a kid?<br/></b><i>Kumail Nanjiani (Stu):</i> I watched <i>Midnight Run </i>later, I didn’t watch it when I was a little kid. But that’s a movie that really to me is sort of the gold standard of this genre of movie. It’s so perfect and intimidating. I’m trying to think what other… <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/turner-hooch/\">Turner &amp; Hooch</a> </i>I liked as a kid but I haven’t seen that in a while. I also liked <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/stop-or-my-mom-will-shoot/\">Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot</a> </i>as a little kid, but haven’t seen that in a while either.<br/></p><p><b>How would you say </b><i><b>Stuber </b></i><b>updates the classic action comedy?<br/></b><i>Dave Bautista (Vic):</i> I don’t know if it updates it. We’re not breaking down any walls here. We’re not creating anything. It’s a new twist on it, it’s a new spin. It’s two different characters. I think what we do bring to the action comedy is a lot of heart.</p><p>There are a lot of really emotional beats in this, which you don’t often see with action comedies. And if you look at the [action comedy] stuff lately, The Rock has done it with Kevin Hart, it’s mostly laughs and a lot of action. But you don’t often have tear-jerking moments, and we have plenty of those in this film. There’s some great arcs in this film. Some great learning lessons in this film. The characters depend on each other and learn from each other and grow as human beings. I hope that’s what sets us apart.<br/></p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>You’ve often talked about wanting to do something new with each role. What was new about this role for you?<br/></b><i>DB:</i> There’s the scruff. I’ve done scruffy before, but I’ve never let my hair grow out, and I’m really self-conscious about letting my hair grow out because it’s thin and the director was like “Could ya?” and I was like “Oh <i>man</i>!”. But I did, I grew my hair out so I would be kind of just scruffy and surly for this. But also he asked me to wear a little [fat] suit, so I’ve got a little belly. And so I kind of loved that because he really just wanted me to break away from my physicality and just depend on my acting chops. When a director sees that in me, it’s a win for me.</p><p><b>We loved your performance in <i>Blade Runner 2049</i>.</b><br/><i>DB: </i>Oh thanks, I appreciate it. I’m working with [director] Denis [Villeneuve] again.  </p><p><b>Yes! On <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dune-2020/\">Dune</a></i>!<br/></b><i>DB: </i>Dude, I’m so excited.</p><p><b>What a cast!<br/></b><i>DB:</i> I know right? It’s like: how the hell am I in this movie?</p>"

You could be the next <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lilfilm/\">Sean Baker.<br/></a></b>The one I have right now is more of a lurking profile so it’s not very formal. I made one that’s a little more presentable for you <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/joetalbot/\">under my name</a>.</p><p><b>Are you in San Francisco right now?<br/></b>I am. If you can hear my heavy breathing, I’m actually walking up one of the steeper hills that Jimmie and Montgomery crest in the movie and see the skyline. That’s what I do for every interview, I like to walk up the hill to put me in the film. Just kidding, this is the first time I’ve done it. I’m just walking with a friend and we’re about two thirds of the way up. Woo!</p><p><b>We’ve just published our <a href=\"https://news.letterboxd.com/post/185987193253/halfway-2019\">halfway top 10 of the year</a>. <i>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</i> is in second place, between <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/avengers-endgame/\"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/booksmart/\"><i>Booksmart</i></a>. How does this make you feel, and how do you cope with reviews (whether they’re full of praise or criticism)?<br/></b>Wow, that means a lot. I find the reviews informative, though have to admit I don’t read too many of them. In general, it’s great to know that there are people that love movies enough to get into debates and write passionately, either about how much they loved them or didn’t like them at all. Having platforms like Letterboxd and finding those communities online can be really great, even if they’re not made up of people in your city.</p><p><b>Given that the film has relatively low stakes—it’s not life or death, it’s house or no-house—what gave you confidence that audiences would connect to Jimmie’s story?<br/></b>I don’t know if we were ever confident. You never fully know. You hope that if you share something that has meaning to you then it will have meaning to others. That was our guiding light.</p><p>We finished the movie four days before the Sundance screening, so that was the first time watching it with any audience. I looked over at [Plan B producer] Jeremy Kleiner when the movie ended; he said “the tweets are good”. I looked around and realized the whole audience were on their phone as soon as the credits rolled.</p><p>I only had a short film play at Sundance before [<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-paradise/\"><i>American Paradise</i></a> in 2017, also starring Jimmie Fails] so I didn’t realize part of our culture now is the need to immediately respond to something—but luckily they were nice. It will be much more anxiety-inducing going into my next feature now that I know how all this works.</p><p>We wanted to make something that captured the San Francisco that we grew up in and feel very strongly about. We’ve travelled to Chicago, DC, New York, LA, and Atlanta with the film and I was surprised to see how much people were connecting to it. In a way, Jimmie and I say it is unfortunately universal because it means the same things are happening everywhere.</p><p><b>This idea has lived with you and Jimmie for a long time. Can you talk us through the journey of the film?<br/></b>We’ve been informally talking about it for at least seven years and it’s gone through so many incarnations. We always envisioned it as the first feature that Jimmie and I would make after many years of making short films together. This story felt big enough in scope and there was a lot that we wanted to cover.</p><p>We wanted to tell a story about Jimmie and this Victorian home he once lived in and make it a valentine to the San Francisco we grew up in, that we see as being lost. We also wanted to celebrate all the wonderful people who are here that make this city what it is. That’s a big part of what we are afraid of losing: the very people that make San Francisco ‘San Francisco’.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>We both lived with my parents for five years—we ran our operation out of the living room there. The first thing we did was shoot a concept trailer for Vimeo. It was a five-minute piece of Jimmie skating through the city telling his grandfather’s story, much like the [feature’s] opening sequence, though I filmed it hanging out of the side of my brother’s car.</p><p>Afterwards we got emails from people saying they wanted to help; they would become our core collaborators on the film. Khaliah Neal, Rob Richert, Luis Alfonso de la Parra, Natalie Teter, Sydney Lowe, Prentice Sanders, Fritzi Adelman, Laila Bahman and Ryan Doubiago. They spent years with us, hashing out the script over my parents’ kitchen table and working with us to create a look-book, <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeandjimmie/last-black-man-in-san-francisco\">run an ambitious Kickstarter campaign</a>, write grant proposals and so on.</p><p>We felt like these oddballs—the last <i>artists</i> in San Francisco. You get a lot of noes along the way, having never made a movie before, so it was the emotional support that helped us persist through the difficult times. We were excited to be learning together, as a group of mostly first-timers, and were constantly making things.</p><p>Our look-book was very elaborate, thanks to our stills photographer Laila Bahman. We built it as a website and staged the scenes as if we were filming the movie, with costumes and heavy art direction. We knew people we pitched were probably seeing materials from other filmmakers who were further in their careers and probably better writers than us. We knew we needed to show the world of the movie so that executives’ imaginations wouldn’t be running off with thoughts of Michael B. Jordan or Donald Glover; that this is Jimmie and this is the plaid shirt we want him in and this is his Victorian. It’s his story.</p><p>That helped us get into the Screenwriter’s Lab at Sundance, but I didn’t get into the Director’s Lab, which I was initially bummed about because I really needed that experience. Our Kickstarter was very successful and those backers created a grassroots ground-swelling around the movie that pushed it forward, even though it was difficult in pitch meetings as we weren’t the most bankable pair in such a risk-averse industry.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort, my crew and I decided to do our own Director’s Lab instead. We felt if it doesn’t work now then that might be it for <i>Last Black Man</i>. I’d never made a proper short with a budget before but a producer named Tamir Muhammad, who had a short-lived venture within Time Warner called OneFifty, gave us the money to make what would become <i>American Paradise</i>. It gave the crew a chance to get in the trenches together before moving on to a feature, and show the potential of what we could do. </p><p>The team who’d assembled from our concept trailer years before all worked on <i>American Paradise</i>, from Khaliah Neal, Rob Richert and Luis Alfonso down the line. We worked with production designer Jona Tochet and even the sound team of Sage and Corinne (who would all go on to work on <i>Last Black Man</i>). In a city increasingly devoid of artists, we felt we’d found our people.</p><p>The short was different from <i>Last Black Man</i>, but features Jimmie playing the same character. After it played in Sundance it got the attention of Plan B’s Christina Oh. They took a big leap of faith on us, only having ever made that short. There’s not a lot of people willing to do that.</p><p>Khaliah, Christina and Jeremy approached A24 and we were in production two months later. From the outside it seems like this dream scenario of having the incredible indie studios Plan B and A24 behind us, but the truth is it took years working on drafts and wondering if anyone would ever read them. I think the extra time we had helped, because if we had the chance to make it two or three years ago, I don’t think we would have been ready. </p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What was the first movie you made with Jimmie when you were teenagers?<br/></b>The first half-decent thing we made was a movie that my brother and I co-directed called <i>Last Stop Livermore</i>. I am actually in it alongside Jimmie and that was my first and only time in front of the camera. I learned my place pretty early on.</p><p><b>Didn’t you have a cameo in <i>Last Black Man</i>? I swear I saw you.<br/></b>I did have a cameo. As long as I’m not speaking, I’m okay. But even then when I just had to look at Jimmie once it was very difficult for me to do. I needed four takes for that shot, ha ha. I’m much more comfortable on the other side.</p><p>Jimmie, however, was really good in [<i>Last Stop Livermore</i>]. We made it while I was in high school before I dropped out, and it got into the San Francisco International Film Festival. Like everything we do, it’s based on something that happened in real life when a friend and I felt like we were fish out of water, going off to meet some girls in the suburbs.</p><p>That attention the film got, however minor, encouraged us because until that point only our family, friends and my high school teacher had seen our movies. Oh and Jimmie still had a flat-top—just thought I should add.</p><p><b>The film features the most important house of the year [Editor’s note: at least until the rest of the world sees the <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/\">Parasite</a> house</i>, designed by the great Namgoong]. How did you find Jimmie’s house and what made it <i>the</i> house?<br/></b>It took us over a year and a half to find the house. We combed the streets with my co-producer Luis Alfonso de la Parra and production designer Jona Tochet and knocked on doors. In hindsight, a more efficient way would have been to use Google Maps but this way we could see inside the houses.</p><p>Unfortunately, the interiors would usually be gutted and have IKEA furniture and granite table tops. As a filmmaker, it was depressing, but as a native San Franciscan it was heartbreaking because the details inside all these beautiful houses were destroyed. It’s a thing that a lot of real estate agents do when they flip houses.</p><p>We ended up going back to a house that I had driven past as a kid on my way to elementary school. My mom, my brother and I would pick out our dream Victorian houses on our family car ride since we couldn&rsquo;t afford a proper one. I went back to one of the houses that had always stuck with me. After we found that house, it felt like we had cast a major character in the movie.</p><p>When we first knocked on the door of the house that would become Jimmie&rsquo;s home in the film, an older gentlemen greeted us and within seconds beckoned us inside. As we entered, we found a home that had not been gutted, but instead had been lovingly restored. Jim, the homeowner, much like Jimmie, the actor, had spent more than half of his life working on the house.</p><p>He carved the witch hat you see in the movie shingle by shingle and did the honor of putting it on the roof himself. He fixed the organs you see in the film and built Pope&rsquo;s hole in the library. In many ways, he felt like the spirit of San Francisco.</p><p>As a now elderly man, we would have understood him declining our wants to film there &ndash; or charging a buttload to help him in his retirement. Instead he welcomed our big crew into his house and charged us next to nothing. I still don&rsquo;t fully know why, but I can imagine he saw shades of himself in Jimmie&rsquo;s love for this Victorian.</p><p>In the years we spent location scouting, we would also meet people on the street that we put in the movie. Dakecia Chappell was working at a Whole Foods in the confectionery section, near a ‘potential Jimmie’s house’ around the corner and she was just really charming, so I offered her the ‘Candy Lady’ part in the film. We met the mover who tells Jimmie the homeowners are moving out late one night at a taqueria on Mission Street. This extra time allowed us to capture the little details of what our San Francisco is like.</p><p><b>Even after your major backing from Plan B and A24, was there a point on set where it felt like everything was falling apart?<br/></b>I’m sure there are directors that aren’t plagued by the self-doubt I had. I didn’t go to film school and I felt isolated in San Francisco since a lot of the filmmakers have left for Los Angeles or New York. I was feeling this imposter syndrome. You’re both really joyous and grateful that you finally have a chance to make a movie, but also feel the weight of the city and wanting to honor what’s happening to people there. In every stage you have big and little freak-outs. The only thing that got me through it were the people around me. They bring perspective when you might not have it.</p><p>A couple of months before we shot the film my dad had a stroke. He survived, thankfully, and he would say half-jokingly “I survived to see the movie”. My parents struggled as artists themselves in their lives and yet they created this loving home that allowed us to make the movie. I look up to my Dad a lot, so when that happened that was really scary, and it happened during the height of the pandemonium of prep.</p><p>By that point our creative collaborators felt like family and they did everything for us. They came over to my house, brought us food, did as much as they could to take work off my plate so I could be with my own family. That always sticks with me when I remember tough times. You could say it’s just a job, but they treated it like so much more. So while it sounds corny, I think the spirit which comes with people being so loving and kind becomes imbued in the film.</p><p><b>Very glad to hear your dad is okay. The scenes with Jimmie’s parents are so powerful; you really get a greater sense of his isolation. It’s amazing his mom agreed to be in the film as a fictionalized version of herself. How did you and Jimmie sketch those scenes?<br/></b>The scene with his mom is loosely based on something that happened. Jimmie was raised mostly by his dad and he’s very close to his parents now in a way that’s very different from the relationship that he had with them growing up. He and his dad have worked through a lot.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>It’s hard to pack in all the complex details that makes someone who they are because you don’t have enough screen time to do that sometimes. These elements were pulled from the walks we’d take during the earliest developments when the idea was more informal and we’d talk about Jimmie’s family.</p><p>One story that Jimmie always recalled both humorously but also quite painfully was about the guy who had driven off in the car that he and his dad were living in at the time. We thought it would be funny if there was a character who never acknowledged that he’d stolen the car but claimed that he was still borrowing it. We knew Mike Epps would be the perfect person for that. It was a story that came from a kernel of truth but took on a life of its own.</p><p><b>Why was Jimmie’s dad pirating <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-patriot-2000/\"><i>The Patriot</i></a>, of all movies? The tonal juxtaposition made us laugh.<br/></b>Ha ha, it was in the public domain. </p><p><b>We loved the score. What are some of the soundtracks that inspired you while making the film?<br/></b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-last-of-the-mohicans-1992/\">The Last of the Mohicans</a>, <a href=\"https://boxd.it/WPg\">The Day of the Dolphin</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-claim/\">The Claim</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-1989/\">Batman</a></i> (and also the animated TV show’s score actually rivals Elfman’s), and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/far-from-the-madding-crowd/\"><i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i></a>.</p><p><b>You’ve spoken in another interview about how you and Jimmie fear friendships like yours aren’t possible with the type of gentrification that’s going on. However, nowadays you can meet some of the important people in your life over the internet. Could the bonds we make online compensate for what’s being lost on the streets?<br/></b>I think the internet is a double-edged sword. It both brings people together that you could never have met, such as how many of our closest collaborators first found our concept trailer online. But I do fear it also plays a part in people developing shallower, less intimate connections. I have friends who I love who will go to events seemingly just to get a good Instagram photo out of it. I’m sure I’ve suffered from similar instincts. That scares me.</p><p><b>Montgomery adds so much tenderness and insight to the film. Given he’s Jimmie’s best friend and he’s also an artist, is he your avatar in the movie? How did the casting of Jonathan Majors inform the development of his character?<br/></b>Montgomery is actually not based on me. Jimmie and I have a friend from the Bay named Prentice Sanders who is one of the more original people we’ve ever met. His spirit influenced the first shades of the character. When Jon came on he took those early sketchings to a whole new level, creating his own backstory, mannerisms, and interests.</p><p>On the vanity in his room, Jon decided to put up Tennessee Williams, August Wilson, Barbara Stanwyck, Canada Lee, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison as inspiration. He had a hand in every little detail. In fact, Jon and Jimmie became very close in real life. They still talk nearly every day.</p><p><i>Warning: the last section of the interview contains spoilers, including for the endings of both ‘Last Black Man’ and ‘Ghost World’. This is your last chance to back out…</i></p><p><b>How do you direct Jimmie? I imagine you can read each other’s minds at this point.<br/></b>Yeah, there is a weird unspoken connection between us, as we grew up together. Knowing each other for so long allowed us to be vulnerable around each other. As a director, inevitably there are days on set that are stressful, scary, and tense, so being able to go for a walk around the block together to recalibrate and feel present was helpful.</p><p>This film asked something much different than anything we had done before. We’d never written a feature script and most of our shorts were ad-libbed. Honestly, everyone broke their backs to make this. Cinematographer <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/adam-newport-berra/\">Adam Newport-Berra</a> was a hero. Nobody phoned it in.</p><p>But more than anybody, we asked the most of Jimmie. There’s a scene where he’s across from his real mother and the bravery from both of them to do that set a tone that everyone on set sought to honor.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>Your collaboration with Jimmie has been so strong for such a long time. Is it a relief for you or maybe a sadness that this phase with him is nearly over?<br/></b>It doesn’t feel like it’s over yet, but I’m sure when it does there will be a little bit of sadness. The movie continues to sell out theaters on a Wednesday afternoon in San Francisco and opened in the little neighborhood theaters that indies barely make it into and it&rsquo;s playing alongside <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/toy-story-4/\"><i>Toy Story</i></a>. There’s a feeling in the city now that’s hopeful.</p><p>It’s been wonderful to witness because I feel like we’ve been working through our feelings about San Francisco in making the movie, and in some ways Jimmie leaving at the end feels a bit like us, how perhaps we can’t be here anymore. I’ve only ever lived in San Francisco my entire life but maybe it is time to go somewhere else.</p><p>However, in putting the movie out there I’ve seen so many more natives that feel like people I grew up with 15-20 years ago. People who I thought had been lost but are still out there, fighting to exist somehow through all the changes. I feel like part of me is falling back in love with San Francisco again and I think that feeling is going to go on for a long time.</p><p>A lot of people are contacting us saying that they left the theater and they just started writing their own scripts, or writing poetry, or sending us paintings that were inspired by the movie. In a city that is increasingly difficult to exist in as an artist and not always inspiring, this always means something to us.</p><p><b>On the film’s ending: to you, where is Jimmie going?<br/></b>Jimmie is going to start his legacy somewhere else—to fully be himself and start anew, following the footsteps of his grandfather. And it’s more fun to shoot it that way than have him ride away on a BART train.</p><p><b>One interpretation of the ending we’ve heard is that it was all in Mont’s head, and in “reality” it ended on a more tragic note. So some viewers felt it as hopeless, but you in fact intended it to be more hopeful?<br/></b>I think we wanted to leave it open to interpretation. I talked to Thora Birch [who has a small role in <i>Last Black Man</i>] about the ending of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ghost-world/\"><i>Ghost World</i></a>, because that always left an impression on me. I interpreted it as a suicide when I saw it as a teenager and she had told me that she felt that way about it too, but there are also people who thought she was going off to art school. I feel our ending works in the same way.</p><p>I don’t see any interpretation of it as invalid, but what your relationship is to your city affects what you bring to it. Either way it’s a bittersweet ending, because it is a loss for Jimmie and Mont’s friendship, and for the city. Like, San Francisco doesn’t deserve him anymore.</p>"

She was behind the lens during the most challenging and remote leg of the journey, capturing the many obstacles of Southern Ocean sailing. “Jo is a woman of remarkable emotional intelligence, patience and bravery,” Holmes observed, “and all of that shone through in the use she made of the camera.”</p><p>Gooding modestly refuses to take full credit for her achievement. Now a counsellor who helps children and adolescents, she describes herself as “not very good in front of the camera”. We beg to differ: Gooding has a prominent and insightful role as one of <i>Maiden</i>’s talking-heads. Plus, we were intrigued by how a newcomer to sailing and cinematography found herself contributing in such a major way to <i>Maiden</i>’s incredible journey. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/\">Jack Moulton</a> asked the questions (and if you look closely, you can spot Jo and her camera in several photographs).</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>What were you originally filming for?<br/></b><i>Jo Gooding:</i> We were filming for a guy called Gary Lovejoy who made a documentary with the footage at the time. They were also collecting it to be sent to the news in different regions. When we got into port and everyone would be on deck having their photos taken I would be going through all that footage to identify what could be used. You do an awful lot of filming so having to go through it all one-by-one is quite time-consuming.</p><p><b>Can you walk us through the system you had for filming on the boat?<br/></b>It was always about being able to grab the camera when some action was happening. If it wasn’t possible to manage the handheld—because it was massive and difficult to hold in rough situations—then you need to ensure that you trigger the button of the [fixed] camera on the stern of the boat so we would have some footage.</p><p>My goal was about trying to get as much different footage as possible. To get rough seas, calm seas, and to get people to tell their stories. Not everybody wanted to speak to the camera, [so it] was quite often a challenge to get the filming that I needed. That was where it was good that other people would pick up the camera as well, especially Tanja Visser who did a lot of the filming as well. It was good that it wasn’t just down to me because that helped in telling the story. I was the designated person who looked after the camera.</p><p><b>Did you direct or encourage re-enactments?<br/></b>Yeah, there were times where I’d encourage things to be done more than once but that depended on how enthusiastic people were and what the weather situation was. You’d have no chance otherwise. There were a couple of times where you’d have to do a take two. We’d have some funny outtakes that were entertaining. There was some great fun times too as well as “oh my god, we’re all gonna die”.</p><p><b>What conversations did director Alex Holmes have with you about the footage, during the making of <i>Maiden</i>?<br/></b>Alex has been wonderful. He’s been so complimentary to me that one day I had to stick my fingers in my ears. I said: “You have to stop now, this is getting too much for me.” When you’re making stuff like that or even being interviewed, you don’t see what others see. It’s great to know that you’ve done something well.</p><p>When Maiden finished it was a whirlwind of attention because people didn’t think we could do it, but then it got forgotten. It’s great that it’s being acknowledged now as something for the challenge that it was, because I think it was a tremendous achievement on everybody’s part. Tracy was the one who stepped up but it wouldn’t have happened if this amazing group of women hadn’t been involved as well.</p><p><b>What was your reaction when you saw the final film?<br/></b>It was incredibly emotional, I had a very soggy face at the end. But it was wonderful to see it with my son because he said “I had no idea about this because I don’t sit down and talk to you about it”. I think New Black Films have done an incredible job at telling the story and it’s great that it’s out there.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>I imagine you’ve enjoyed many reunions during the release of the film. Have you kept in touch with your crew-mates over the past 25 years?<br/></b>Some of them I’ve been in touch with the whole time. Last year was the first time we were all together and it was like we’d never been apart. It was just like it used to be, very relaxed and great fun. We were all saying “you haven’t changed at all” which isn’t true, but that relationship hasn’t changed, since you get very close to each other on Maiden, spending your whole time living and working together.</p><p><b>Do you have a reputation now as “that woman who sailed around the world”? How do people you meet react to this awesome fact?<br/></b>No, it’s not my reputation. It’s quite funny, since I’m so small and quiet and prefer being in the background. I was doing the Gower Bike Ride and somebody talked about “that girl over there that sailed around the world”. This guy came over to me and this girl I was riding bikes with; she was a surfy type—tall, athletic-looking, blonde, beautiful and all of that—and he came over to her and flirted. “Oh, I hear you sailed all around the world.” She turned around and said “It’s not me, it’s Jo.” He was absolutely gutted, ha ha.</p><p><b>How do you prove it to the skeptics?<br/></b>I don’t need to prove it to anybody. This was something I did. It was a dream and it came true. That’s always been the thing for me. I’ve spent most of my life working with vulnerable people and trying to support them to get them to a better place, so it’s never really been about me or what I’ve achieved. But then again there’s been times when I’ve shared that, to enable the people I work with, to help them believe they can do it themselves since to look at me you couldn’t believe that I could have done what I’ve done.</p><p><b>Have you sailed much since? Would you have done it again?<br/></b>I don’t think I would have done it again—no, actually I might have done it again. I was involved with another project with Tracy Edwards with the Royal Sun Alliance. I also sail in the Isles of Scilly [off the Cornish coast], which is like my second home. Sailing is a wonderful part of my life, it’s quite a special thing. I never really was a racer but I’m quite good at looking after people—so that was really my role on board.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>What was the most unforgettable sight you saw aboard Maiden?<br/></b>I think the Southern Ocean was the most challenging to be in but also the most unspoiled because you couldn’t see another boat or another person on the horizon. All you saw was wildlife, sea and icebergs. It was quite scary at times because it was a place where not many people go. I believe more people have climbed Mt. Everest now than have sailed in the Southern Ocean.</p><p><b>What would you say about the glass ceiling in sport? Where are we at?<br/></b>I think that men and women have some similar strengths and different strengths, there are women out there who are just as physically strong as men. We can still be as competitive or as high-achieving and we absolutely deserve the same respect as men in the sporting world.</p><p>It’s wonderful watching the women’s World Cup of Football while it’s being televised at the same level as the men’s. It’s fantastic now how it’s been given the same value. What’s happened in the past few years has made that clear, that there’s still a lot more to do. We have the same strengths as men and we all deserve the same respect. We’re here for our skills and qualities not for what we look like.</p><p><b><i>Maiden</i> is a really inspiring film. What films inspire you?<br/></b>I love true stories. I’m a counsellor so I love hearing people’s stories. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-beautiful-mind/\"><em>A Beautiful Mind</em></a>: I am passionate about mental health and this is a great story about living with schizophrenia, with support, empathy and love. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hidden-figures/\"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a>: an inspirational film, proving dreams can come true. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/erin-brockovich/\"><em>Erin Brockovich</em></a>: a courageous woman fighting for justice, with truth and determination. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hiding-place/\"><em>The Hiding Place</em></a>: another great story of courage, about Corrie Ten Boom and her family protecting Jews during the war and risking their own lives in the process. Wonderful films!</p>"

How do you feel about being a part of something so enthusiastically embraced like this?<br/></b></b>Well, I’m very shocked and proud. With <i>Chernobyl,</i> the scripts were so incredible, when you have quality like that you feel something happening on set. The story is unbelievable even though it’s all true. None of us expected such a tragic realistic drama would reach people like this and have the reaction it’s had. It’s made me feel really excited about what film, TV, and storytelling can be. It’s not just escapism like Marvel or fluff. It can be very deep, provocative, political, and very human. I’m really honored.</p><p><b><b>Does that [radiation sickness] makeup haunt your dreams too? I can’t imagine seeing that in person.<br/></b></b>Oh yeah, oh my god. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/adam-nagaitis/\">Adam Nagaitis</a>, my co-star who played my husband, was in make-up for nearly 10 hours just to get that right. The incredible art of the people who did that work is mind-blowing.</p><p><b>For <i>Wild Rose</i>, director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/tom-harper-1/\">Tom Harper</a> has said that you were the only actress he could picture for the lead. That faith in you must be really gratifying. What was the first aspect of the script that hooked you in and made you realize how Tom was right to enlist you?<br/></b>I’m not even sure I would have said Tom was right. I was more “My God, are you sure?” What first excited me about the script was that it was like a prison break film; how Rose-Lynn was a catalyst for all these amazing women to break down the walls in their lives.</p><p>I was directed by Tom for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/war-and-peace-2016/\"><i>War and Peace</i></a> and played Princess Marya, who’s the complete opposite to Rose, so I don’t know how he saw me on that set and thought “oh yes, she’s good to be an outlaw”. But I loved working with Tom so much that I was so excited to work with him again. It’s very rare that you meet creative partners where you have an unspoken relationship.</p><p><b>Your character’s mantra is ‘three chords and the truth’. It’s tattooed on her arm. What part of your own truth did you want to bring to the role?<br/></b>You’ve got to be as truthful and honest to the character as you can and I always try and meet a character halfway. She comes away with a bit of me and I come away with a bit of her. But it’s nothing black-and-white like that, it happens after you’ve been nattering away to each other over a period of time and sharing each other’s passions and struggles.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>So Rose-Lynn’s goal is to go to Nashville, and you’re currently bouncing between America and the UK for your projects [Buckley’s upcoming films <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/judy-2019/\"><i>Judy</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ironbark/\"><i>Ironbark</i></a> were shot in the UK while <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-voyage-of-doctor-dolittle/\"><i>The Voyage of Doctor Doolittle</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/im-thinking-of-ending-things/\"><i>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</i></a> filmed in the US]. You’re in New York right now. What do you think it is that keeps the American dream alive?<br/></b>Ha, I don’t know. I think people have achieved incredible things in this country. For Rose, Nashville is the epicenter for passion. Everybody who feels like her is there. It’s a promised land where her dreams can be accepted and she won’t be an outsider anymore.</p><p><b>As a novice to the genre, how did you prepare to play someone who lives and breathes country music? Did you discover any singers in particular who affected you?<br/></b>I think my entry point was Emmylou Harris. ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymtaxqsqZQg\">To Daddy</a>’ was one of the first country songs I learned. Bonnie Raitt was also a huge influence on me. I really loved her voice and the way she told stories in song. She’s an amazing musician and her womanhood and honesty inspired me. Those two artists especially, and then the lyricist John Prine I was just blown away with.</p><p><b>You co-wrote the songs for the film with screenwriter Nicole Taylor. It was your first time songwriting. Did that come naturally? What was the collaborative process?<br/></b>It wasn’t an idea pre-meditated before the film started. When we were filming, we would bottle around to Nicole’s house on a Friday night with coffee and croissants and since we had lived with this character for so long the lyrics just filled out between us all.</p><p><b>What did you find most difficult about playing a mother whose biggest obstacle is her maternal responsibilities?<br/></b>Balancing life and balancing wanting more for your life is a very tricky thing whether you’re a mother, or a father, or anybody. I don’t think there’s anybody in the world who hasn’t had moments where they’ve struggled with the dilemma of nurturing your individuality but also the relationships that you’re in.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>How did you feed off playing against Julie Walters and Sophie Okonedo.  What was the creative atmosphere like?<br/></b>They’re just the best of the best. Julie is an incredible woman and so down-to-earth. Getting to stand opposite her, I would just look at her and go “God, I wanna be like you when I grow up”. She’s in it for the right reasons. There’s no fuss. She just gets to set and is so available, generous, and as curious as you are to find the scene.</p><p><b>You’re starting in film almost ten years into your acting career [Buckley made it to the final of the UK talent show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAnpVSEHdHM\"><i>I’d Do Anything</i></a>, where contestants competed to star as Nancy in the West End musical <i>Oliver!</i>].

      "body": "<p>An animated short before a Pixar feature was a beloved tradition that remained unbroken for 23 years, until Disney decided to nix it this year for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/toy-story-4/\">Toy Story 4</a></i>. It wasn’t an intentional decision, apparently. The producers recently revealed they simply <a href=\"https://bgr.com/2019/06/18/toy-story-4-no-short-film-before-movie/\">needed the person-power to focus on their feature slate</a>. Pixar promise the beloved shorts will be back, but we’ll miss those li’l treasures.</p><p>So, to celebrate the art of Pixar shorts, Letterboxd list maestro <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack/\">Jack Moulton</a> has picked through the studio’s animated shorts, ranking them by our community’s average rating. He also hunted through your reviews to find out why these wee stories rank where they do, and noted which films won or were nominated for Academy Awards.</p><p>As well as providing another stab at an Oscar category, Pixar’s shorts offer an opportunity to share emerging talent and emerging technology. Jack has also done a sweep through Pixar’s technological development, exploring how the shorts convey what’s going on behind-the-scenes at the studio. Plus, he takes a look at where the various directors were at in their careers at the time. Many personal stories abound, with directors—both newbies and veterans—drawing from their own childhoods and heritages. All of them are textbook examples of efficient storytelling, often subbing dialogue for emotive gestures or mumblings in a language you may not speak.</p><p>For the purposes of the list, only films that preceded features in theaters are eligible, thus some of the company’s early works are missing and there’s no DVD extras. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/olafs-frozen-adventure/\"><i>Olaf’s Frozen Adventure</i></a> is Disney’s fault so it’s not included, but, no surprises, it’s last. </p><p>View our full <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/pixar-shorts-ranked/detail/\"><b>Pixar Shorts Ranked</b> list here</a>.</p>"

The new film updates Chucky’s origin so that it similarly reflects a heavily marketed contemporary product: smart toys.</p><p>While the original Brad Dourif-voiced Chucky was, sorry, <i>is</i> a talking doll who became possessed by the soul of a serial killer, the new Chucky is an artificially-intelligent robot friend who turns murderous when his programming is tampered with. And he’s voiced by Mark Hamill.</p><p>Aubrey Plaza (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ingrid-goes-west/\">Ingrid Goes West</a></i>) stars in the film as Karen, a single mom who takes home a returned Chucky from the big-box store where she works and gifts it to her son Andy, played by Gabriel Bateman (who previously encountered a sinister doll in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/annabelle/\">Annabelle</a></i>).</p><p>Norwegian filmmaker Lars Klevberg directed the new <i>Child’s Play</i>, which was written by Tyler Burton Smith. Klevberg’s American feature debut, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/polaroid-2019/\">Polaroid</a></i> (an expansion of his own <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/polaroid-2015/\">2015 Norwegian short</a>), has yet to be released in the States due to the Weinstein Company’s ongoing problems.</p><p>Letterboxd caught up with Plaza, Bateman, Klevberg and Smith at this year’s Wondercon.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>What was your reaction when you were offered this film?<br/></b><i>Aubrey Plaza (Karen):</i><b> </b>I was so honored that they thought I could pull that character off and took a chance on me and, I dunno… Chucky is an iconic character in the history of film so I feel really lucky to be a part of it. I’m really excited about that.</p><p>I play a woman named Karen Barclay who is a single mom. Her son is named Andy and she’s kind of a young mom doing the best she can and struggling a bit but trying to provide for her son. She ends up giving Andy a toy for his birthday that starts to try to kill everybody, so… but Karen thinks that her son is kind of losing his mind. So she’s going through a lot.</p><p><b>And Chucky was on set while you were filming?<br/></b><i>AP: </i>Oh yes, we did a lot of things practically, so the doll was there at all times.  </p><p><b>What do you think fans of the original should expect from the new </b><i><b>Child’s Play</b></i><b>?<br/></b><i>AP: </i>I think they should expect a total re-imagining of this character. I think the whole idea behind it is: how could Chucky be relevant right now? And the idea of making Chucky a smart doll is kind of brilliant and it’s a cool way to bring Chucky back into the theaters, you know? And show a whole new generation of people how terrifying that doll can be.</p><p><b>Is it tough making something that is cute also scary?<br/></b><i>Tyler Burton Smith (screenwriter):</i><b> </b>I think in some ways when something is cute or funny, it puts the audience at ease in a way, because they feel like it’s safe and I think in some ways that builds the horror more. When you feel safe with a character or with a product or with a thing, seeing that transform into something dark is a lot easier. Because you’re put at ease and then you’re fighting against that. So I think that’s kind of a fun dynamic shift in a way.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>This is an R-rated horror with kids in peril—is it tricky to know how far to go with that?</b><br/><i>Lars Klevberg (director):</i> Well, there are different levels, when you’re making a movie, of how far you wanna push it. When you’re dealing with a <i>Child’s Play</i> movie, when you introduce Chucky as a toy, of course there will be kids involved. We bumped up the age a little bit on this one, which I think was a smart move. Andy’s no longer eight, he’s thirteen. But we’re dealing with a movie that takes an object that everybody loves—a doll, a toy—which is in many ways when you’re young, it’s kind of your safe spot. And you turn that around and what you love and trust in your fantasy world when you’re young turns against you, so suddenly your fantasy world becomes very very real and that’s interesting.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>This is a separate project to the original Chucky franchise, which is still going. How did having the original creator of Chucky vocalize his opposition to this film affect you, if at all?</b><br/><i>TBS:</i><b> </b>We love the original <i>Child’s Play</i>. We love Don Mancini. I grew up on <i>Child’s Play</i>, it’s just an awesome movie and we wanna make the best version of that possible. It’s unfortunate that he’s not more involved in this movie. It would’ve been amazing to work with him on this, but we love <i>Child’s Play </i>as a whole, we love him and just wanna make the best version of a <i>Child’s Play</i> film possible.</p><p><i>LK:</i> With something like this, it’s an iconic IP, of course you think about it, but you get the script and you read the script and you connect to the story and the characters and for me as a director that’s where it starts. And you have to be able to separate that and just focus on what’s there on the page, which we did. Tyler has a big brain, and he was able to get in a lot of those things that made the first one successful. I kind of jumped on and went back and watched all the movies and I was amazed by how the atmosphere was still there.</p><p><b>What do you think the key differences are in this version?<br/></b><i>TBS:</i> A big part of it is the doll in the original film was just a stationary doll that you played with and it had these lines that it would say, but otherwise it was just a doll. The idea of updating that and asking what this toy would be now, or five years from now in the future, the idea of a different kind of product that is more technologically advanced was definitely kind of at the heart of it, but definitely keeping a lot of the elements that made the original great.</p><p>When I figured out the direction they wanted to go I thought it was a great balance of being a tribute to the original and doing something new with the franchise at the same time. It wasn’t just an excuse to remake a movie, it felt like a lot of people who loved the original who wanted to do an awesome reinvention of that concept. I was a bit nervous at first, but once we found the direction for it, I was really excited. I think we found a cool fresh take on that film.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>You dealt with practical Chucky dolls on set—did you ever get concerned they might turn on you?<br/></b><i>Gabriel Bateman (Andy):</i> No, not really. I don’t know how much I can say but the animatronic dolls don’t really have all that much motion. But I mean, when I’m actually filming and the cameras are rolling, I feel afraid, because I’m trying to be the character, but as soon as the cameras cut, it’s the same.</p><p><b>You’ve been in a lot of horror, but you’re totally a kid. Have you ever seen any of the horror stuff that you’ve been in?<br/></b><i>GB:</i> I don’t think there’s ever been something that I didn’t watch that I was in. I think I’ve watched everything.</p><p><b>Were you excited about the idea of being in a remake of <i>Child’s Play</i>?<br/></b><i>GB:</i> I kind of figured out that it was <i>Child’s Play </i>from the [audition] side, so I watched it pretty early on, but I was really excited. A lot of my family were fans of the original trilogy before, so I was always familiar with it. So yeah, I was definitely excited.</p><p><b>What do you think </b><i><b>Child’s Play</b></i><b> fans will make of the film?<br/></b><i>GB:</i> We’re not trying to take away from the original in any way. It’s just a re-imagination of Chucky as a character, so I just hope people can enjoy it as its own film, without comparing to the original.</p>"

What did you convey to Toby Harvard when you first approached him about this idea?<br/></b><i>Ant Timpson: </i>I gave him the skeleton structure of: staying alone in a house with a dead body, trying to process that. Maybe thinking about: you didn’t know everything about your dad, the unresolved issues, not getting answers that you wanted, wanting to say stuff to him that you didn’t. All that stuff sons have with their dads. And mothers and daughters. So during the rest of the week [when Timpson Sr’s body was on display], people came to the house who I didn’t know had this alternate history [of my dad]. And learning that information, my brain took it to crazy extremes, as I do, as a movie guy. I took it in to weird areas. And I started formulating it and thinking. But also, a big part of it was like: watching someone die in front of you—what am I doing with my life? I used to dream about directing, and I’ve just been servicing everyone else’s dreams.</p><p><b>So your father’s death also served as an impetus to pursue your directorial dreams?<br/></b><i>AT:</i> Get tryin’ or get dyin’, man. It was kind of like that. And I didn’t feel like I could just grab a script as a producer, because I come across scripts all the time, and nothing was like “Ooh, I need to direct that”.</p><p><i>Elijah Wood:</i> I get that. I get that the impulse isn’t to just simply find a piece that somebody else wrote. It had to be personal, a fire within you that needed to be told.</p><p><i>AT:</i> So it was the impetus, but it needed to have that emotional connection to make it actually happen. I was just lucky enough that Toby was game, and Toby brought everything to the party. He took that [idea] away and then came back with a draft that was really funny. It was kind of different from the final film. And so we bounced back and forth. </p><p>He got pissed off with me because I was quite rude, I think, with the first feedback I gave. We’ve got this dynamic relationship about the whole film. I think I was like: “This is really <i>Greasy</i>, we need to de-<i>Grease</i> it”. And so he did. And we always thought about Elijah. Toby was like, “It would be amazing for Elijah to be in it,” and we talked about that and what he could bring to it and ground the whole thing. Eventually it was in good enough shape to send out and so [producer] Mette-Marie [Kongsved] and Elijah read it. He was the first to read it really out of the gate.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><br/><b>Elijah, you’ve had a professional relationship with Ant for years prior to this. Were you surprised or excited to hear that he was making his first film as a director?<br/></b><i>EW:</i> Not surprised. Excited. It all really just fell into place. Because it was Toby too, we had all worked together on <i>The Greasy Strangler.</i> There was a lot of connective tissue that made sense. And it was not a surprise. I mean, he’s a filmmaker. As a producer, part of the job is understanding the process and guiding that process, so it’s not a huge leap. Then reading that script, it was just instant. It’s one of the better scripts I’ve read in years. It leaped off the page and it constantly surprised me in terms of where it was going. It starts off as one thing, and every step of the way your expectations are subverted. It’s shocking and funny and fucking crazy. And a blast. I immediately fell in love with it. And was intimidated by it. </p><p>I think from an emotional standpoint, what Norval has to go through… it’s a lot on Norval’s shoulders. And so I wanted to make sure that I delivered for that. I was honored that [Timpson] wanted me to be a part of it but I was also anxious about making sure that I honored that and serviced that in the right way. Particularly because it was based on a personal experience of Ant’s.</p><p><b>Was the Ant that you worked with on set as a director the same Ant you’d worked with in the previous years as a producer?<br/></b><i>EW:</i> (high pitched) Yeah. Yeah.</p><p><i>AT:</i> I feel like that’s part of my background of organizing events-based stuff: getting teams of people enthusiastic about things [Ant’s <a href=\"https://www.48hours.co.nz/\">cinema-centric events</a> are the <a href=\"http://www.incrediblystrange.co.nz/festival/history/\">stuff of legend</a> in New Zealand]. And I think that really helps when you get a team around you. Plus, I had zero arrogance because I didn’t know what the fuck I was doing. Kind of. I knew what I wanted but also had a lot of pressure I put on myself. So I felt like I had a really great support team that were there for me and once I knew that, my confidence just went straight up.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>It’s clear from the films you’ve produced that you love movies that push the boundaries. Have you drawn any conclusions about how far you can push that kind of stuff?<br/></b><i>AT:</i> I wanted a film that was pretty accessible at the end of the day. And I also knew that this had a decent budget for the type of film, more than I had been used to for some other things, so there was a responsibility that we’ve got to reach an audience. And it’s hard. But I also didn’t want to alienate the audience that I think would really like it. So it’s right on that fine line.</p><p>I don’t feel like it fits totally within [my produced works], like there’s elements of it in the previous producer stuff but I honestly feel like when I was watching it that there’s not… it takes a while. This is slow burn, man. I think it rolls out at just the right pace for when things happen. Like it’s building and building and then when things snap it starts to unravel quickly.</p><p><i><a href=\"http://www.sabanfilms.com/\">Saban</a> has acquired ‘Come To Daddy’ for distribution; the film will have a US cinema release.

Egerton—as the film’s marketing campaign has made very clear—does all his own singing in the film, and he’s pretty darn decent.</p><p>Letterboxd recently sat down with Egerton at an exclusive press event in West Hollywood where he talked about his experience making <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rocketman-2019/\">Rocketman</a></i>, and what it was like getting to know the man who inspired it.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>Egerton began by talking about the film’s fantastical approach and how it uses John’s rehab journey as a framing device:<br/></b><i>Taron Egerton: </i>The mandate for the production was always that it wouldn&rsquo;t be an out-and-out biopic, that it would lean into these elements of fantasy. The movie begins with Elton entering rehab and those scenes are what I’m most excited for people to see, because to see someone who’s so universally known in such an intimate, vulnerable situation, I think is quite unusual. And it says something about Elton and how candid and resilient he is. Elton recounts his life through rehab, we learn his story from being a young child and going to the Royal Academy of Music. And it essentially goes right the way up to the point where he goes to rehab.</p><p><b>On how he felt going into the role:<br/></b>It was terrifying. Because it’s a musical and because it’s a fantasy, it was always a prerequisite that the actors sing. So there’s a tricky thing, particularly following in the wake of something like <i>Bo Rhap</i>, it’s so unmistakably Freddie, the sound of it. So for me it was about singing the songs as well as I possibly could. But we were lucky in the sense that Elton and [husband] David [Furnish] are very close to the project. It started with them, and Elton has been fantastic in letting me be a part of his life for the past couple of years. And befriending me, frankly. Which has made the whole thing feel very personal and very real.</p><p><b>On how he went about embodying Elton John:<br/></b>Weirdly, I found the stuff where I played him older, easier, and I think that’s because all the time I’ve spent with Elton has been older Elton. I haven’t spent any time with 21-year-old Elton. There is footage, but it’s interesting, because people portray such a version of themselves on camera. I don’t know. For me, it all kind of came from the first time I sat down with him and we had curry together. I went over and I had a takeaway curry at his house. And we just talked for about two and a half hours. It’s such a hard thing to describe. When you are given the honor of playing one of the most adored and famous people in the world, there’s such a weight of responsibility that comes with it. And then when you meet them and connect with them generally, I don’t know, it just feels like one of the most important things I’ve ever done. I can’t really describe the feeling of having gone through the whole thing. </p><p>There’s an element of getting to look as much like him as you can, which is very helpful. There’s four rough stages of Elton. The first one being his kind of teenage bowl-cut, chunky Buddy Holly glasses. Then into the longer hair, early 20s stuff where we’re in LA. And then the hair starts to go. For the third look I shaved my hair line up higher than it already is by a couple of inches. And for the fourth and final look, I have a bald cap. There’s something about changing yourself completely and the way you look that really conditions how you feel.</p><p>One thing about Elton is that at some point in his mid-late 20s, things started to get a little bit out of control and unraveled a little bit for him I think, and there’s something to do with putting a slight gap in my teeth and changing my hair, it just didn’t make me feel very much like me. And so I created this hybrid of me and him.</p><p>That’s another thing as well, through getting to know him, I feel like there are some parallels between me and him. I mean, I’m not a genius, but in the sense that some of the neuroses and insecurities, I just recognize some things. So there’s a lot of me in there and my emotional volatility and I’m someone who has very extreme and acute reactions to things. I’m potentially a little emotionally volatile at times. And that is, I think, certainly who Elton was. So it’s just about dialing up those things in yourself, and dialing other things down.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On the film celebrating Elton John’s sexuality:<br/></b>I’m a straight actor playing a gay icon, so I again felt very, very keenly that if I was going to do this and do this properly that we had an obligation to honor that side of his story. So early on the film there is a love scene, it’s between myself and Richard [Madden, who plays John’s manager and lover John Reid]. It’s the first love scene I’ve ever done and it’s two young guys falling in love in a time where it possibly wasn’t that socially acceptable and I think it is a scene I’m really, really proud of.</p><p>There is a community that feels a certain sense of ownership over icons that are a member of that community, so we have that responsibility to honor that part of their story. And it’s been fantastic, especially working with Paramount on this, who have always felt very strongly that this was a part of the story that we needed to push and honor and see reflected in our film. And I’m really pleased with it, I think it’s lovely actually.</p><p><b>On the film not shying away from Elton John’s substance abuse:<br/></b>This is not a movie that glamorizes drug use. Elton’s relationship with certain substances was extremely corrosive and bad for his health and nearly cost him everything. And that was an important part of the story for me. The balance is also in making it something that is joyous, celebratory and fun to watch. And that has been the knife edge that we’ve had to walk along. And I hope people will feel we’ve done a good job of that.</p><p><b>On leaning into the truth of Elton John’s volatile personality:<br/></b>A documentary was made by David about Elton 25 years ago called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/elton-john-tantrums-tiaras/\">Tantrums and Tiaras</a>.</i> It is no secret that Elton has his ups and downs. We were true to that—it’s who he is. And frankly I think it’s why we love him. So I felt very much when we were on set that I wanted to push it. Because the one person I knew wouldn’t mind me doing that, was Elton. Because he’s not precious. He knows where his strengths and weaknesses lie, and he’s very at peace with who he is.</p><p>He’s been through a hell of a lot and he’s been through recovery and he is settled and solid and knows who he is and he’s quite candid about it. So for me I always wanted there to be that duality between this sweet, incredibly caring, generous person, who just has this intense artistic sensibility and volatility, and I believe that is hand in hand with his creative genius.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On how younger audiences less familiar with Elton John might respond to the film:<br/></b>Elton’s music is still so played on the radio but I hope that there’s a world in which we bring music to some young ears that haven’t heard it before. Well, young-ish ears; it’s not the most child-friendly film. But young ears nonetheless. I think there’s a universality to Elton’s music. I don’t think the success of Elton’s music is entirely conditional on the context in terms of time. It was brilliant music in 1971, and it’s brilliant music now. Everyone loves Elton John, but for relatively young people like me to go back and then listen to all the stuff that made his name in the early 70s, things like <i>Amoreena</i>, <i>Take Me To the Pilot</i>, <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Border Song… </i>and you just go, fucking hell, it’s just, it’s mind-blowing, the output. In an ideal world—you can’t plan for it—I would hope that people rediscover Elton through the film.</p><p><b>On what playing the role has meant to Egerton:<br/></b>As with most people, I can pinpoint times in my life as early as five where I was aware of Elton John. I remember that video of him doing <i>The Circle of Life </i>when I fell in love with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lion-king/\">The Lion King</a> </i>when I was five or six. I remember being twelve and the Greatest Hits coming out, and me and my stepdad, who my mum had just met, who became a huge part of my life, him and I sitting listening to that Greatest Hits album, singing <i>I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues </i>together as he drove me to school.</p><p>Then when I was 17 and I auditioned for drama school and sang <i>Your Song</i>. I didn’t get in. Then I sang it again the following year and I did [get in]! I knew it was a winner. And so he’s always been there, Elton John as this kind of, idea. And then in 2016, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/kingsman-the-secret-service/\">when I’m still barely able to process the fact that I’ve been in a hit movie</a>, for someone to say “Do you want to play Elton John?” And to go “Well how does Elton feel about it?” and hear “He really loves the idea”. It’s just fucking mental innit?</p><p>It’s just insane. Creating the film, without wishing to get too earnest, has felt like a hugely important thing for me. And a hugely important thing for posterity in some sense, because hopefully in the future it will be so many people’s introduction to Elton John. I feel like I’ve poured more of myself into it than I have anything else and so for me I feel very satisfied by the whole experience. </p><p>It’s been hard work. And essentially has been my life for the past year, 18 months, with creating all the songs and recording them and re-recording them and changing things and going back after we filmed. But I wouldn’t have changed a second of it. And I would do it all again. There’s not many things I would say that about.</p><p>And then, just getting to know him and to genuinely feel a connection with the great man. I sang with him recently, I still can’t believe that that happened. I genuinely get a bit emotional thinking about it.</p>"

In the meantime, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/bong-joon-ho-recommends-parasite-preparation/\">here’s a list of films personally selected by Bong</a> to get you in the mood for <i>Parasite</i>!</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/\">The Lighthouse<br/></a></i></b><i>Written and directed by Robert Eggers</i></p><p>One of the impossible-to-get tickets of Cannes 2019 premiered in Directors’ Fortnight, in part because of anticipation of the new film from the director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-witch-2015/\"><i>The Witch</i></a> and in part because of the presence of the rumored new Batman himself.</p><p>Our Cannes correspondent was shut out despite waiting 90 minutes in the rain, but those with even more dedication found their efforts duly rewarded, like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/blaiser123/film/the-lighthouse-2019/\">Blaise Radley</a>: “I queued for four hours to see this, and knew it had been worthwhile within the opening four minutes. Stark, dizzying, stomach-churning—this is a surprisingly different beast to <i>The Witch</i>, but it’s in exactly the same tier… Needless to say, Dafoe and Pattinson are phenomenal.”</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/\"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Céline Sciamma</i></p><p>Some see the inclusion of four female directors in Competition as a high-water mark, others as a glaring reminder of how far we still have to go to achieve gender equality. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-joe-2019/\"><i>Little Joe</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/atlantics-2019/\"><i>Atlantique</i></a> both brought home prizes, but the latest from the director of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/girlhood-2014/\"><i>Girlhood</i></a> took top marks not only as the best female-directed film, but one of the very best of Cannes.</p><p>Letterboxd member notmckinzie was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/notmckinzie/film/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/\">more specific</a> than most in her effusive praise: “Someone took all of my interests and did a study about what was gonna make me lose my goddamn mind and then they gave the results to Celine Sciamma and let her do her thing and now we have this! Throw in the mythic allegory, lots of women, 1800s period setting, fine art, pro-choice messaging, and lots of sexual tension?? We have a winner, ladies!” Also: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/\">Ehrlich</a> has found his new <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/carol-2015/\">Carol</a></i>.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/\"><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i></a></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino</i></p><p>The hottest ticket in town became even hotter after Tarantino cancelled the traditional last-day re-screening in order to re-edit the film, meaning those lucky few who got in will be the only ones ever to see this cut. Its detractors called it meandering, but fans loved getting lost in its reverie of 1969 Hollywood. Take <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lou_kicks/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/\">Lou Hicks</a>: “<i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> is wonderful. It’s like Tarantino is just dreamily reminiscing for our benefit. Feels innocent somehow—lovely, pure, hilarious, charming.”</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/atlantics-2019/\"><i>Atlantique</i></a></b><br/><i>Directed by Mati Diop</i></p><p>Even before Mati Diop’s freshman feature screened, she was assured of making history, as the first black woman in Cannes Competition. But her otherworldly seaside tale cast a spell on the 4pm audience, earning a lengthy standing ovation, and jury members were equally rapt. It was, as Chin Lin Gan <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/spikejonzevevo/film/atlantics-2019/\">writes </a>: “An awe-inspiring, disciplined, rigorous and terrifying piece of work [that] operates on a hypnotic and almost occult powerful mode of storytelling that makes you think of folk-tales that grip generations and generations.”</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sorry-we-missed-you/\">Sorry We Missed You</a></i></b><br/><i>Directed by Ken Loach</i></p><p>British activist Loach has long been a staple of the Cannes competition, but for both veteran fans and those new to Loach, his cautionary tale about precarious lives in the gig-economy resonated, not only as one of his strongest films but one of the strongest of the festival. Sebastian Chan <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/omightyseb/film/sorry-we-missed-you/\">heralded it as</a>: “Brilliant, powerful stuff from Ken Loach … Funny, heartbreaking and eye opening; this is one of those must see films.”</p><!--figure[7]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/and-then-we-danced/\"><i>And Then We Danced</i></a></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Levan Akin</i></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/call-me-by-your-name/\"><i>Call Me By Your Name</i></a> fans, your new obsession is here. This Georgian tale of first love and dance prompted no fewer than six Letterboxd members to compare the two films (with George Wood <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/woodyg/film/and-then-we-danced/\">going one step further</a>, dubbing it “<i>Call Me By Your Name</i> meets <i>Whiplash</i>”). Other members, though, felt no need for comparisons, with Emma <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/moosegoose/film/and-then-we-danced/\">declaring it</a>: “Stunning and incredibly moving. Love poured out of every shot. Films like this are the reason I wanted to come to Cannes.”</p><!--figure[8]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/deerskin/\"><i>Deerskin</i></a></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Quentin Dupieux</i></p><p>The absurdist creator of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rubber/\"><i>Rubber</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wrong/\"><i>Wrong</i></a> has divided Letterboxd members fiercely in the past, but early reviews agree that <i>Deerskin</i>, the opening film of the offbeat Directors’ Fortnight, is a giant step forward and his best film yet. What is it about? Let’s let Anton Vanha-Majamaa <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/aavama/film/deerskin/\">summarize</a>: “A hilariously odd and an oddly hilarious film about a divorced, worn-out man (the amazing Jean Dujardin channeling Colin Farrell in <i>The Lobster</i>) who becomes obsessed with a deerskin leather jacket that seems to have a mind of its own.”</p><!--figure[9]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/papicha/\"><i>Papicha</i></a></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Mounia Meddour Gens</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-invisible-life-of-euridice-gusmao/\">The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmão</a></i> may have won Un Certain Regard, but the debut feature by Mounia Meddour Gens, following a woman in 1997 trying to put on a fashion show in the midst of oppression, pipped it to the post with our members. Clara <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theclara/film/papicha/\">declared it</a>: “The best film I watched in Cannes. Absolutely loved it. It’s heartbreaking and beautiful. I walked into the screening not really knowing what to expect, but I was mind blown.”</p><!--figure[10]--><p><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-hidden-life-2019/\"><i>A Hidden Life</i></a></b><br/><i>Written and directed by Terrence Malick</i></p><p>Terrence Malick’s three-hour WWII epic may have come home empty-handed from the Croisette and divided the press, but Letterboxd members loved it more than most (including <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dillamonster/film/a-hidden-life-2019/\">our own Cannes correspondent</a>). Savina Petkova <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/savixpotter/film/a-hidden-life-2019/\">named it</a>: “The best film you can see in 2019, simply put. A timeless meditation on human suffering, the nature of evil and how it relates to our crooked nature.”</p><p><b>Special mentions</b><br/>The highly acclaimed documentary <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/for-sama/\">For Sama</a></i>, and two films that opened in their domestic territories prior to Cannes: Pedro Almodóvar’s Spain-premiered <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pain-and-glory/\">Pain and Glory</a></i> and Kirill Mikhanovsky’s Sundance premiere <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/give-me-liberty-2019/\">Give Me Liberty</a></i>.</p>"

He shares his choice for favorite Indian movie with Bollywood actors Aamir Khan and Shraddha Kapoor and it ranked number 160 on <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i>’s all-time 2002 poll. “It’s not just poetic in itself but it understands the poetry as the fuel of human soul, as something that connects us and makes us who we are,” raves <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/vadekawa/film/pyaasa/\">Still Here</a>.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>2. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/garm-hava/\"><i><b>Garm Hava</b></i></a> (1974)<br/><i>Directed by M.S. Sathyu</i></p><p>After the joy of <i>Pyaasa</i>, <i>Garm Hava</i> is a more serious film that deals with the post-Partition plight of Muslims in 1940s India. Its influence was so impactful that it’s credited with pioneering a new wave in Hindi Cinema. The 2014 restoration is awaiting home distribution, but <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/surajdhanrajgir/film/garm-hava/\">those who have seen it</a> say it’s a “contender for both the greatest Indian film of all time and greatest performance by an Indian actor [star Balraj Sahni]”. Ritesh Batra agrees.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>3. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-city/\"><b><i>The Big City</i></b></a> (1963)<br/><i>Directed by Satyajit Ray</i></p><p>Fortunately for us, Satyajit Ray’s films are well preserved and you can stream <i>The Big City</i> on our favorite new toy <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-big-city/videos/the-big-city\">The Criterion Channel</a>. His 1963 film makes history with its subversive take on working women challenging the patriarchy. It ranks in Letterboxd’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dave/list/the-official-letterboxd-top-250-movies-updated/page/2/\">top 200 of all time</a> and our members discover and decipher it every day. “There’s such a compelling mixture of melodrama and matter-of-factness in <i>The Big City</i> that it feels impossible to nail down,” notes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mosdeaf/film/the-big-city/\">Alex</a>.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p>4. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shakespeare-wallah/\"><i><b>Shakespeare-Wallah</b></i></a> (1965)<br/><i>Directed by James Ivory</i></p><p><i>Shakespeare-Wallah</i> is only the second of 23 films <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNtvTr4hADk\">Oscar-winner</a> James Ivory directed using Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s scripts, and it made a big impression on Ritesh Batra early on. It follows a troupe of English actors who travel around India performing Shakespeare’s plays, and covers a transitional phase where Bollywood begins to replace theater. Fun fact: Satyajit Ray composed the score. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/movingpictures/film/shakespeare-wallah/\">Letterboxd</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kbertolero/film/shakespeare-wallah/\">members</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/prad/film/shakespeare-wallah/\">praise</a> the “incredibly beautiful and effective black-and-white photography”.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p>5. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/salaam-bombay/\"><i><b>Salaam Bombay!</b></i></a> (1988)<br/><i>Directed by Mira Nair</i></p><p>Bollywood’s second-ever movie nominated for an Oscar, Mira Nair’s drama sticks to the streets of Bombay, viewing life’s struggles through the eyes of twelve-year-old Chaipu. According to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/djoshuva/film/salaam-bombay/\">Dany</a>, it’s a film “that doesn’t hold back even for a second” and marks a notable achievement for women filmmakers, with a female director/producer, screenwriter and cinematographer.</p>"

What Robin Williams did with his character was, he just didn’t leave a lot of room to add to The Genie. So I started off fearful. But then when I got with the music, it just started waking up that fun, child-like, silly part of me.</p><p>The song that got me over the hump of “Yes, I can play Genie”, was <i>Friend Like Me</i>. I went into the studio the first day and I really wanted to play with it to see if I could add something to it. And literally 30 minutes in the studio, and starting to play with it and finding that in that 94, 96 BPM range, we were playing around in there, thinking ultimately it was a little bit faster than that. But that 94, 96 BPM range is right old school hip hop.</p><p>So I grabbed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqbEsS5kFb8\">The Honey Drippers’ <i>Impeach The President</i></a>, which is a really classic old school hip hop break-beat. And I had them throw that break-beat under there. And I messed with that and I messed with Eric B. and Rakim’s <i>I Know You Got Soul</i> under <i>Friend Like Me</i>. And I was like “Oh my God. I’m home, I’m home!”. I started playing with the hip hop flavor and then The Genie was really born in my mind from the music.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Of all the animated remakes, <i>Aladdin </i>probably hews closest to the plot of its inspiration, with the bonus of Princess Jasmine’s arc being beefed up a bit. She’s now somewhat more in control of her own destiny, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xcQAZdZb30g?t=57\">a new solo number</a>, <b><i>Speechless</i></b>.</b></p><p><b>Actress Naomi Scott describes performing the new song, which was written for the film by Disney legend Alan Menken, along with <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/la-la-land/\">La La Land</a> </i>and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-greatest-showman/\">The Greatest Showman</a> </i>songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul:<br/></b><i>Naomi Scott (Princess Jasmine)</i>: The fact that they wrote a song and I get to sing it, first of all, I was like, wow. That’s already surreal. But then when I heard it and just the words and the lyrics and how timely it was, the message behind the song and the idea of not going speechless, that everyone has a voice, doesn’t matter who you are, doesn’t matter what you look like, doesn’t matter what your gender is, your voice matters. And speaking out against injustice matters. Not just standing by and being a spectator. That day was very emotional because I wanted it to feel raw. And I wanted it to feel like what she’s going through in that moment. We did some of it live as well which was a different type of challenge.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On Princess Jasmine’s 2019 character update:<br/></b><i>NS:</i> I really think it was a natural progression. Guy said something which I thought was really great. He was talking about equality of challenge. The idea that Jasmine needed even more of a challenge in this movie as well. As I said, it’s a natural progression. The fact that she wants to become the leader. I kind of just want people to walk out and go, oh yeah, that makes sense, right? She should be the leader. It’s not this thing that’s been shoehorned in. It just makes sense. And she’s a human. For me as an actor, my main thing is, how do I humanize her, how do I give her depth? So those things just came naturally.</p><p><i>Guy Ritchie (director/co-writer):</i> If there was anything that looked like there could be some evolution in this narrative, it was that there needed to be a voice given to Jasmine. I mean, Aladdin has been given enough challenges to get on with. Genie had his hands full. The most conspicuous character thereafter was Jasmine, who was arguably a tad bit passive in the original. And it just felt like there was an obvious space there that we could have worked on. And as Naomi said, it was about equality of challenge. Because there’s no point banging on about something unless you can back it up.</p><p>To me, it’s not really about gender as much as it is about an individual standing up for themselves at a pertinent time. And they can illustrate that point, they can articulate that point. And they have the breadth and personality to do that. And I think it really works actually, that part in the film, because it is backed up. So that just felt like it was the most obvious place that this narrative could evolve, was to give Princess Jasmine a voice and that she could back that voice up.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>On bringing his own directorial flavor to the project:<br/></b><i>GR</i>: You’ll be surprised how familiar I am in this territory considering I’ve got five kids and the oldest one is 18, which pretty much means I’ve been up to me eyeballs in Disney productions for 19 years. And also, by sort of family demand, it was about time I made a movie that we could all watch together. So <i>Aladdin</i> ticked the box in the sense that it was a street hustler and I was familiar with that territory. And frankly, I was just ready to do something in this world. Of course, it’s very hard to be objective about your own work, but inevitably what happens is that you leave an imprint upon it. But you know some clever director once said that the lion’s share of directing is casting. And I think that’s true. And I think once we got our little team together, it didn’t take us long before we all dialled into that same frequency. But then it just all worked from there.</p><p><b>On the diverse backgrounds of the film’s cast (Massoud is Egyptian-Canadian, Scott is English-Indian):<br/></b><i>Mena Massoud (Aladdin):</i> I’m especially proud of the representation and the ethnically diverse casting that was put together for this. It’s not often you can go to a movie theater and see all people of color represented like this. It’s certainly something that I was missing in my childhood. So I’m proud of the cast and the casting that Guy and Disney put together. I’m excited for little boys and girls to go see people that look like them on screen, man. That’s what I’m proud of.<br/></p><p><b>On Will Smith’s decision to get back to work:<br/></b><i>WS:</i> I took a couple of years off. And I guess I had sort of hit a ceiling in my life. I had created the things that I could create in my career. I was getting to the end of my wisdom with leading my family and I kind of got to a point where I had a bit of a collapse of my life and creations. So I took a couple of years off essentially to study; to study and journey spiritually.</p><p><i>Aladdin </i>was really my first sort of coming back in and seeing if my heart was even still in this kind of performing, and what I discovered is everything starts with: what am I saying to the world? How does this piece contribute to the human family? Can I go around the world with the ideas that the movie represents and can I teach and preach these ideas in good conscience?</p><p><i>Aladdin </i>checks all of those boxes. I love the idea of Genie, and one of the things that I related to in Genie is that the Genie has shackles. The Genie has these spectacular powers, but he’s shackled. Like, he is a prisoner of his spiritual fate. And that is sort of how I felt with Will Smith. I was sort of shackled by Will Smith. And in these last couple of years, I’ve just started finding my freedom, getting free of Will Smith and I’m getting more comfortable being me. So <i>Aladdin </i>was that first step back out.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>On the power of Disney:<br/></b><i>WS:</i> This is my first Disney movie. There’s something that Walt Disney did in the design of these stories that at the core shocks the inner child within you and forces it to come alive and smile and appreciate the moment. This was the most joyful experience of my career.</p>"

I inquired as to the rights with my friend, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/producer/allyn-stewart/\">Allyn Stewart</a>, and we were able to acquire it and begin the process of developing the film.</p><p>Obviously the story’s very compelling in its own regard. I was really moved by the relationship between Elizabeth Gilbert and Willingham and then what developed in the worst of circumstances. But I also felt that it was a catalog of everything wrong with the criminal justice system now. Most of all, how poverty and class are the determining factors in whether a man gets a fair trial.</p><p><b>You’re a writer, but you enlisted <i>Precious</i> screenwriter <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/geoffrey-fletcher/\">Geoffrey Fletcher</a> to write this film. What qualities made his perspective the right fit?<br/></b>I knew that Geoffrey was a collaborative writer and that he would invite me to that process so we would do this together. We would have the benefit of his best ideas and mine as well. That often makes a happy working relationship.</p><p><b>What did you discover in your research on prisoners and death row?<br/></b>There was a lot I was surprised about. I didn’t know that for many years they used solid doors rather than bars to keep prisoners even more isolated. I didn’t know how little time they allowed them to exercise nor that their letters were subjected to being read from the inside and outside.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>Jack O’Connell is always reliable but this is a particularly powerful performance. What preparations for the role did you assign to him?<br/></b>We spent some time in jails and read all of Willingham’s letters. We did exercises in a very small cell where he was able to be there for hours to contemplate what that experience might be like.</p><p><b>Willingham is, for the most part, an off-putting character. Even when he meets Gilbert and he’s been through his transformation he’s still a misogynist. How did you want to balance the way the audience could invest in him as a person with the commentary on how society judges the accused?<br/></b>That was deliberate. I was very intent on having Willingham be unsympathetic, and Jack was very willing to portray him that way. I felt that I wanted the audience to condemn him the same way that people had also unfairly done so in the courts of Texas.</p><p>Even if someone is a representative of toxic masculinity and whatever else he was interested in, he still deserves equal treatment under the law and so we embraced that part of him. We trusted that his circumstances, and Jack’s ability to portray that transformation, that that would earn him the compassion of the audience who had been complicit in condemning him.</p><p><b>How did you decide the way you wanted to portray the lethal injection in order to make your political statement?<br/></b>I spoke to a lot of people who had been in those rooms and we read a lot about it. I felt that it had to be real. It was actually an exact replica of the room and the process from everything that we had learned about it.</p><p><b>Ultimately, the film’s hopelessness overrides the sense of hope it conjures. It’s a tone that has been appearing more and more in contemporary cinema, particularly with new mainstream interest in “true crime”. What do you think is driving this focus on a more downbeat realism?<br/></b>It’s funny, I think there’s an appetite for authenticity. I think we’re full of superheroes and sequels and there’s some urge to have a real mirror to be held up to the world.</p><p><b>How do you weigh the importance of the work of <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org\">The Innocence Project</a> for those currently on death row, versus those—such as Willingham—who were executed before any hope of exoneration?<br/></b>The Innocence Project is a godsend to those people and not everyone has had the benefit of it yet. By the way, it’s not alone, <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org\">The Marshall Project</a> is there, so there are so many opportunities, but they are remarkable people doing remarkable work.</p><p><b>You conclude the film with searing footage of [former Texas Governor] Rick Perry expressing pride in his death-penalty record. Did you intend to call him out specifically when you started the project?<br/></b>The more I learned about what had happened and what he had done in abolishing the review board even after the fact, I felt that he deserved to be held accountable.</p><p><b>Do you know if his team has responded?<br/></b>They have not. I hope that they will.</p><p><b>What do you think needs to change about Hollywood to grant mid-sized budget films like yours a pathway to be made again?<br/></b>Exhibitors need to keep the films in theaters for more than a week so audiences can see them. But I don’t know, the major studios have abandoned them because they don’t make enough money to move their stock price for multinational corporations. There has to be an economic model or a sweet spot where the films can exist and exhibitors can be happy enough to run them for audiences. All of these things have not lined up yet.</p><p><b>Any chance we’ll see you back for another <i>Jack Reacher</i>? [Zwick directed the 2016 sequel <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jack-reacher-never-go-back/\">Never Go Back</a>.</i>]<br/></b>Nope.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>If <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/glory/\">Glory</a></i> had to be made today, what would you want to change and what do you feel you would have to change about it? [The 1989 film about the U.S. Civil War’s first all-black volunteer company focused the story around white general Robert Gould Shaw; problematic, as many Letterboxd reviewers have noted, because it <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/glazomaniac/film/glory/\">“centers a white character in a story about black soldiers fighting the people who enslaved them”</a>.]<br/></b>The problem would be that they wouldn’t give me the money to do it properly today. The film has to be about an entire regiment, and a studio now would just give me a dozen guys and a forest. It would’ve been fun to have some of the tools of CG to have a few things a little bit more realistic than I feel they come across in the movie, but that’s perhaps just my harsh judgement on myself.</p><p><b>Ideally your social issue films can break through and make a difference in the world. Do you know if <i>Blood Diamond</i> has had a tangible effect on the diamond industry?<br/></b>I believe there are some statistics to that fact but I certainly know anecdotally from people who’ve told me they always try to source fair-trade diamonds, or chosen another stone, or chosen a zirconia, which are pretty good-looking in my experience.</p><p><b>While it’s tough to get the larger-budget films you make made without the likes of Tom Cruise or Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead, in light of a big push for diversity in the past few years, how has your opinion shaped on the responsibilities of representation?<br/></b>I want to cast who’s appropriate for each film and I am in the business of trying to be authentic. I believe in social engineering in many forms but not when it conflicts with artistic integrity.</p>"

Fans of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/aquarius/\"><i>Aquarius</i></a> will recognize aspects of Mendonça Filho’s extraordinary technique, to be sure, but may also be taken aback by the directions in which he goes.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>A quick scan of our members at the fest confirms the confusion: “Doesn’t always work but is excitingly ambitious in what it packs into its runtime,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/talkingelvish/film/bacurau/\">Andy Hazel</a>. “A gloriously demented (and lightly psychedelic) western,” enthuses <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/bacurau/\">David Ehrlich</a>. “The experience was just unpleasant for me,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/victorcannell/film/bacurau/\">Victor Cannell</a>, who left early.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>It won’t be a surprise to those who have followed Mendonça Filho’s career, including his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/brazil-is-not-a-democracy-aquarius-premiere-cannes-red-carpet-protest\">red-carpet protest of Brazil’s government</a> at the 2016 <i>Aquarius</i> premiere in Cannes, that <i>Bacurau</i>—named after the small northern Brazilian town where the film unfolds—is a heavily political film. It arrived on the world stage amid controversy, as the government has demanded the return of money used to fund Mendonça Filho’s debut, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/neighboring-sounds/\">O Som ao Redor</a> (Neighboring Sounds)</i>. “It’s unprecedented in the history of filmmaking in Brazil, to return this money with interest. It makes no sense at all. We are fighting it with lawyers,” he says.</p><p>At the Cannes premiere, the cast and crew found themselves overwhelmed with emotion and caught crying by the cameras. At the following day’s press conference, Mendonça Filho elaborated: “There is this whole idea of destroying the arts in Brazil. It’s fucking amazing to have these Brazilian films here while they’re trying to hide the Brazilian cultural output. That’s one of the 57 reasons we were crying.”</p><p>Also shedding a tear was prolific German star Udo Kier, who spoke lovingly of the three weeks he spent filming in “paradise”, and the honor of sharing a scene with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/sonia-braga/\">Sônia Braga</a>, who he’d adored watching in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/kiss-of-the-spider-woman/\"><i>Kiss of the Spider Woman</i></a>. “Someone said to me last night ‘you made over 200 films’. But! 100 are bad. 50 you can enjoy with alcohol. And 50 are good.” (It’s safe to say <i>Bacurau</i> is in the latter category.)</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>The Brazilian cast members were equally proud of the film, if not more so, given the voice it gave to their struggle. It would be a spoiler to tell you which character said it was an honor to die on screen, but Thomas Aquino, who plays a native of Bacurau, spoke plainly about the value of the film as a cultural object. “We use this movie as our weapon. This is our protest. This is how we fight. Doing culture, doing education.”</p><p>While the press conference focused on <i>Bacurau</i>’s cultural content, its cinematic roots are equally front and center. And no influence is more primary than horror directing legend <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/john-carpenter/\">John Carpenter</a>, which Mendonça Filho and Dornelles make clear in the film, from a local school that bears the name of ‘Joao Carpenteiro’ to the bold use of one of the maestro’s recent tracks during a key night scene.</p><p><b>“I have no choice. I must make movies. It&rsquo;s a lifelong affair.”</b></p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>The respectability of John Carpenter—hurrah!—is official, a move that comes as a long overdue but pleasing development for the maestro. During the first days of Quinzaine des Realisteurs (Directors’ Fortnight), Carpenter received Le Carosse D’Or, an honorary award for his lifetime of work. He chose a screening of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-thing/\"><i>The Thing</i></a> to mark the occasion, noting that at the time of its release, it bombed. “Even the fans hated it. So I thought it would be incredible revenge on them to screen it at Cannes.”</p><p>In an hour-long Q&amp;A hosted by French directors <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/katell-quillevere-1/\">Katell Quillévéré</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/yann-gonzalez/\">Yann Gonzales</a>, Carpenter delivered pearls of wisdom in humble, self-deprecating style. From making the titular Thing work on screen (“it’s just a pile of rubber in a room, you’ve got to make it scary”) to finding a crew (“you want to find people who are better than you”—the best advice of the fest so far) to underplaying his use of the Steadicam (“It’s a poor man’s dolly, you don’t have to set up tracks … I’m not an innovator. But if it makes me sound smarter, I will accept innovation.”), he happily gave the impression of someone who doesn’t overthink things. </p><p>This came through especially clearly in his description of his directing style: “I get the actors out of makeup, have them roughly walk through the scene, see where they’re going to stand through my viewfinder, and set up the shot. It takes about five minutes. All this has become instinctual over the years.”</p><p>Carpenter’s favorite part of making a film, though, is just before cameras roll: “The anticipation of making a movie is exciting, when you have the script and the funding … but then the hard work and pain comes. The most exciting thing is when it opens in theaters, and means I never have to think about it again.” While he doesn’t have a script ready to go, he did note that he “needs to do another alien invasion movie” and “would love to make a thriller in Europe”.</p><p>Fingers crossed. In the meantime, he eschews going to the cinema himself: “In America it can be an unpleasant experience. People use their phones … I’m afraid of what I would do to people if I experience that,” but keeps up with recent horror via screeners, noting that it’s inspiring to see how other directors approach a scene and what they choose to emphasize. </p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>Inevitably in 2019, politics raised its head. Carpenter noted that he’d gotten into a blow-up online regarding 1988’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/they-live/\"><i>They Live</i></a>, which had been mis-interpreted by Nazi apologists as being about Jews. “I made it clear that it wasn’t. It was about yuppies! And then they’re arguing with me about what my film means!” He lamented that America is in a bad state, but also noted that what really makes him despair are international tragedies like the gassing of children in Syria. When asked what gives him hope, his answer was simple. “Talking to people gives me hope. You’re here, you care about cinema, you care about something other than yourself.”</p><p>That said, there’s a limit to what he’d reveal: when a fan asked if he could say which of the two characters at the end of <i>The Thing</i> was the monster, he replied simply, “I know which of those two men it is, but I’m not going to tell you.”</p><p>Carpenter hasn’t directed a film since 2010’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-ward/\"><i>The Ward</i></a>, enjoying a “rock star” life of watching basketball and playing video games (most recently, Fallout ’76), but he still sees himself as a filmmaker. “I have no choice. I must make movies. It’s a lifelong affair.”</p><p>While we wait for Carpenter to make his return to screen, it’s worth <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/john-carpenters-greatest-influences/\">catching up with the films he shared as his biggest influences</a>.</p>"

Once I found Karlene Faith’s book <i>The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten</i> [Faith’s study of the rehabilitation process and elongated incarceration of the three Manson Family girls], I saw a whole side of the story that literally never gets represented.</p><p>I got very excited that I could make a good movie out of this and it would also be an interesting commentary on what it says about society that we always treated these women like they’re interchangeable. Nobody’s ever asked “what happened to them?”, “what made them do what they did?” and more importantly “why did we stop talking about them?”. We never stopped talking to Charlie! There was a real opportunity to talk about men and women, who and when we pay attention to historically.</p><p><b>Did you get the chance to work with Karlene Faith in person before she passed away [in May 2017]?<br/></b>Yes, she was fantastic. It took a while to persuade her into talking to me at first. I slowly gained her trust via email, then we would talk on the phone, and eventually I would be visiting her apartment in Vancouver and we became friends. For about two years we were as thick as thieves.</p><p>Her book was obviously a huge resource but she was also useful for research as she was a woman of that time. She gave me a great visual, listening to her activist life outside of prison. When she met the girls for the first time she had all these assumptions that they were gonna be freaky psycho-killers and she was blown away by how sweet they were. She was immediately turned by them and she wanted to help them.</p><p><b>What were some of the unexpected realities of living in a cult environment that you wanted to portray?<br/></b>So I grew up in a cult environment as you probably knew so I assume that’s why you ask that question. [Ms. Turner spent the first eleven years of her life as part of the Lyman Family. They were devotees of Mel Lyman who believed he and his commune members would eventually live on the planet Venus. Though parted from her mother after birth, she and her younger sister were ejected from the Family when her mother eventually decided to leave. Ms. Turner considered returning at eighteen but chose to go to college instead.]</p><p><b>Yes, I read <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/my-childhood-in-a-cult\">the article in <i>The New Yorker</i></a>.<br/></b>For me, I was excited to bring this knowledge in my DNA of what it’s really like living in that environment to represent both the good and the bad parts. You have those semi-orgy scenes and people doing acid, but also scenes where everyone is sitting around for dinner. That grounds it a little more. At the end of the day, it is a family—albeit an infamously weird one—but it is a bunch of people trying to live together.</p><p>While there’s the “everyday” quality to it I also wanted to show the volatility. It can be beautifully tranquil one moment and then turn on the dime into something scary and destabilizing. I feel like those things were true of my childhood. Mary Harron heard me talking about my upbringing for decades and she would always say “you should write about it”. I didn’t want to write about it specifically, but when I found this movie I thought I could bring something personal to the project that no other screenwriter could.</p><p><b>We’re curious about how you like to write. What music do you listen to while you work and are there any films you used as inspiration?<br/></b>I can’t listen to anything when I’m writing. I have noise-cancelling headphones that don’t cancel noise enough. I could live in an actual sensory deprivation tank while I write and I would be so happy, but unfortunately you can’t bring computers underwater. So, no music.</p><p>I watched a lot of movies of the era, especially unconventional movies about Jesus such as <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jesus-christ-superstar/\">Jesus Christ Superstar</a></i> (1973). Those were interesting aesthetically. </p><p>There’s a shot in the movie where they’re walking up the side of this mountain and I just loved that iconography. We were short for time on the day and I pleaded with Mary to make it happen. It made me so happy that it became one of the images they use for the promotion of the film. It does feel like this biblical journey and we were trying to capture that vibe.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>What do you do to ensure the female gaze is considered from the script?<br/></b>I find a lot of that is intuitive. For example in this script, there has to be nudity but you notice that every time someone is naked in this movie it’s really uncomfortable. That’s one thing in terms of subverting male gaze, is that there’s no way that any person could see those scenes as objectifying the body for more than a nanosecond because of what’s happening.</p><p>It’s all about power, so I like that it’s portrayed as being uneasy. Even when Matt Smith is naked, Charlie is exerting power over someone else and she’s repulsed by him. That’s one of my favorite scenes in the movie. </p><p><b>How does your acting background feed into the way you write your characters?<br/></b>I think because I’m an actor I deeply feel the reality of what’s available for the average female actor to play. There’s tons of “someone’s girlfriend” and all the tropes, so for me when I’m writing I’m asking myself what about this is going to make an actor say “yes please, let me play that part!”.</p><p>I need to present something complex and challenging that they don’t often see. As someone who’s auditioned for many characters that I thought were poorly written, I try and give even the small parts something that will make an actor excited to play them. </p><p><b>What makes your creative partnership with Mary Harron work so well?<br/></b>It’s funny because we’ve never really asked ourselves that. Of course in the last week we’ve been asked that a lot while we’re in the same room and we look at each other like confused animals going “why <i>does</i> it work?”.</p><p>We realize that we have a similar sense of humor so we laugh a lot even while we’re writing all this dark stuff. The main factor is that we really trust each other. One of the hardest things about collaborating is that you’re not sure if someone is shooting down your idea because it doesn’t work or they’re jealous that it’s good. You need to trust that you can test stupid ideas with them.</p><p>When we first met in 1996 [shortly after Harron’s directing debut <i>I Shot Andy Warhol</i> and Turner’s writing debut <i>Go Fish</i>] we immediately had an affinity for each other and started writing together. It was as easy the first time we tried it as it is now. There’s not even much of an evolution. I feel really lucky for that because as a screenwriter it certainly means I have a lot more access to the movie than usual because the director is always checking in with me. </p><p><b>Despite all of the bleakness, it’s clear in the film that these women just wanted to be loved. There’s such a deep sympathy for them. What interests you about the line of responsibility for those influenced by dangerous charismatic leaders?<br/></b>I’d say everything about that interests me.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>I’m drawing parallels to politics today such as the alt-right people that Trump influences, for example.</b><br/>We’re seeing echoes where people are mindlessly following a person who is validating evil, dangerous, and disgusting ideas. For these women I had to constantly remind myself that they <i>did</i> commit these horrible crimes.</p><p>I feel like Charles Manson and Donald Trump are apples and oranges except for the fact that they strike me as people where their only real fuel is power and that half the time they don’t know what they’re doing or saying, they’re just terrified of losing it. They almost have no internal life. They just feel when they have the power and when the power may be taken away and what they do to keep it makes people do terrible things. It’s like an addiction.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>I’m sure you’re painfully aware that we have four Charles Manson films coming out in a short space of time. There’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tate/\">Tate</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-haunting-of-sharon-tate/\">The Haunting of Sharon Tate</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a></i>, though I’m certain <i>Charlie Says</i> was conceived before all of these. How do you feel about being a part of this cycle?<br/></b>I started writing the movie in 2014 and most of the time movies are made two years later but that’s not how it worked out for various logistical reasons. So on the one hand, I cringe that it’s the 50th anniversary [of Sharon Tate’s murder] and that’s when our movie’s coming out—it feels tacky but it’s definitely not on purpose.</p><p><b>Which seems to be very deliberate on Tarantino’s part…</b><br/>But the way independent films work is that you try and get them made until you get them produced. You don’t have these luxuries of when exactly they’re going to come out. That said, we have landed in a zeitgeist moment which is nice in terms of people paying attention to the movie. I don’t know much about <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> but I’m sure Tarantino has a radically different approach from ours. </p><p><b>While they share some similarities, your depiction of Charles Manson doesn’t work in <b>quite</b> the same way as <i>American Psycho</i>’s Patrick Bateman. How did you decide the ways you wanted to humanize Manson?<br/></b>I think the first thing that’s similar between how we portrayed these two characters is that while they’re these powerful frightening people, we’re demystifying them and grounding them in an essential pathetic loserness. Mary and I don’t talk about how we can make another movie that takes down toxic masculinity, that’s just where we end up sometimes.</p><p>With<i> American Psycho</i> the stakes of social responsibility were different. We were asking people to put your baggage with the book away, we’re women making this, and we are trying to turn it into something that’s a critique of masculinity in a funny and dark way.</p><p>For <i>Charlie Says</i> we’re trying to say: stop thinking about Manson as the embodiment of all evil. We want to stop giving him that power and show that he was a conman who was just a failed musician. If he got a record deal, maybe nobody would have died.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>I have to say, <i>American Psycho</i> holds up really well for the Trump era.<br/></b>One could argue that it works better now than when it came out.</p><p><b>How do you respond to the way you’ve already satirized these sociopaths in power and how that affected the increasing appreciation for the film over the years?<br/></b>It’s gratifying, because [<i>American Psycho</i>] was not particularly well loved when it came out. That’s disheartening when you work hard on a project that you think is more worthy. That said, it being more relevant now is terrifying. I watched the movie again recently and there’s a little part of you that cringes when we make Trump jokes because Donald Trump was a different kind of funny at the time.</p>"

When asked what he looks for in a film that he’s considering acting in, for instance: “Something that pulls me in … but I don’t know what it’s called.” On the directors he has worked with, he did manage to reveal: “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/paul-verhoeven-3/\">Paul Verhoeven</a>, who I did my first five features with, made me walk. I was a baby. He taught me how not to act. Ridley [Scott] taught me to dance. And I danced like a motherfucker.” </p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>More rewarding was the competition lineup, particularly <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bait-2019/\"><i>Bait</i></a>. Englishman Mark Jenkin, who shoots on black and white 16mm film, has produced his first feature following several shorts. Set in an unspecified Cornish fishing village, <i>Bait</i> chronicles the tensions between the “old way of life” and the modern, where locals are edged out by out-of-towners buying investment properties to run as Airbnbs, and fishing boats give up their trade to host stag parties. </p><p>It takes time to adjust to Jenkin’s stylistic flourishes, but he’s relentlessly attuned to the emotional truth of his characters, even as the celluloid flares and ripples; call it kitchen-sink unrealism. Shot on a Bolex with the 13,000 feet of film negative hand-processed, <i>Bait</i> has a solid 3.5 on Letterboxd at the time of writing—a good indication that the Lucca Film Festival has its eyes open beyond the usual suspects. (Other competition titles include <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/eternal-winter/\">Eternal Winter</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/those-who-work/\">Those Who Work</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-family-submerged/\">A Family Submerged</a></i>, and Nicole Brending’s winning film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dollhouse-the-eradication-of-female-subjectivity-in-american-popular-culture/\"><i>Dollhouse</i></a>.)</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>My film festival jaunt ended with a highlight: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/mick-garris/\">Mick Garris</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/joe-dante/\">Joe Dante</a>, in town for the Italian debut of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nightmare-cinema/\"><i>Nightmare Cinema</i></a>, an anthology horror film which Garris produced and which both of them directed segments for. They proved an excellent double act in their masterclass. Dante is a walking encyclopaedia of film history, needing only the slightest prompt regarding the history of Italian cinema to reel off a string of names that influenced him (including Mario Bava, Antonio Margheriti, and the “three Sergios—Leone, Corbucci, and Sollima”), as well as a trenchant analysis of what killed the Italian film industry in the mid 70s.</p><p>Dante is also unafraid to call it as he sees it, labelling the current Italian cinema a shadow of its former self, slamming the original <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-blair-witch-project/\"><i>Blair Witch Project</i></a> an “exercise in emptiness”, and expressing concern about the future of film, noting that “Netflix has ended the Hollywood movie industry” and “the dream of making movies people will see on the big screen the world over is pretty much dead”. He was shocked that an audience member had seen his last full feature film to date, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/burying-the-ex/\"><i>Burying the Ex</i></a>, a film that he noted was flawed. Someone give this man some money for his Roger Corman biopic <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-man-with-kaleidoscope-eyes/\"><i>The Man with Kaleidoscope Eyes</i></a> now!</p><p>Mick Garris, meanwhile, is the quintessential “glass half-full” character. Noting that filmmakers have to “evolve or die”, he pointed out that TV has gotten really good, and a lot of feature films have gotten really shitty. In spite of <i>Nightmare Cinema</i>’s 12-year gestation period—a film that finally came to exist due to the support of streaming services, incidentally—and having taken his share of knocks, including having his anthology Showtime series <i>Masters of Horror</i> cut short when it was sold to NBC after its second season (becoming <i>Fear Itself</i>), Garris seems fully aware of what a lucky man he is. </p><p>This was illustrated best with his story of being hired by Amblin Entertainment to write the first episode of Amazing Stories when he was surviving on food stamps. Both Dante and Garris recognize their Amblin experience as a special time, in part because Steven Spielberg’s supportive presence offered a buffer between them and the studio. </p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p>A Joe Dante masterclass without a few <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gremlins/\"><i>Gremlins</i></a> stories would be a sad thing indeed. He indulged us: the film’s original puppetry was insanely complicated and required 100 people; moreover, after principal photography had wrapped, Dante had to spend an additional month and a half on insert shots of gremlins. He was offered a sequel the weekend it opened, but couldn’t stand looking at those creatures again so soon, and only came back to the project after several failed attempts to develop the sequel by others. </p><p>Offered a chance to direct “anything you want” if he made a sequel, Dante drew inspiration from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hellzapoppin/\"><i>Hellzapoppin’</i></a>, a fourth-wall-breaking, genre-defying, wildly under-seen comedy. While the puppetry was easier <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gremlins-2-the-new-batch/\">the second time around</a> (25 puppeteers this time), a last-minute release date shift by the studio from May to August—to combat <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dick-tracy/\"><i>Dick Tracy</i></a>—wound up hamstringing the film’s success.</p><p>If you’re desperate for more, both Dante and Garris have deep Internet presences: Dante runs <a href=\"http://trailersfromhell.com/\">Trailers from Hell</a>, with commentaries from dozens of filmmakers on various trailers as well as interview podcast <a href=\"https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast/\">The Movies That Made Me</a>, and Garris hosts the <a href=\"https://postmortempodcast.libsyn.com/\">Post Mortem Podcast</a>. A few of these stories, in fact, are taken from a special episode of the podcast recorded at the film festival after the Masterclass. </p><p>And if you’re looking for some anthology inspiration, Joe Dante gave us four of his favorites; <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/joe-dante-recommends-anthologies/\">check out his list</a>. Next stop, Cannes!</p>"

She plays a newly pregnant young woman who starts ingesting dangerous objects. A scene in which she ingests thumbtacks caused a Tribeca attendee <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/tribeca-audience-member-faints-swallow-screening-1202129624/\">to faint</a>. Fair enough. Letterboxd member Bill Bria <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/billbria/film/swallow-2019/\">says</a> the film “starts as a Polanski-esque take on mental illness, and blossoms into a character study of a woman taking control.

The character made a real impact on Letterboxd member nextbestpicture, who enthusiastically <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nextbestpicture/film/buffaloed/\">describes</a> her as “a hustler, a go-getter, an entrepreneur and a perfect mixture of grit and intellectualism with the occasional vulgarity thrown in.

Then came last year’s <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, with its devastating cliffhanger in which many Marvel protagonists evaporated into dust. That epic act of character disintegration built an anticipation for the follow-up that allowed the filmmakers to apply incredible restraint in the film’s marketing. Indeed, all we really know about <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is that we don’t know anything.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige announced that there would be nothing in the trailers from beyond the first twenty minutes of the film. That is unprecedented in modern blockbusters, which center their campaigns around the major action set-pieces, usually dutifully showcased in teasers and trailers to the point where we complain we’ve already seen the film.</p><p>In the modern marketing-saturated film-going environment, to go into a film of this size and not be aware of which direction the story is heading, or what the major action scenes will be, is an almost impossible task.</p><p>Feige and co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo are to be commended for using their accumulated powers for good in this regard—not since <i>Gone Girl</i> has a major studio film shown such restraint. Heck, they didn’t even let press see the movie before we sat down with Feige, both Russos and the (currently officially alive) cast members of the film (pretty much the original <i>Avengers </i>team) in downtown Los Angeles this week.</p><p>Read on for the low-down on the Avengers’ best Boggle player, Natasha Romanoff’s evolution from “sexy secretary”, and the scene that had Robert Downey Jr. “more shredded than a julienne salad”.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>Letterboxd: Filmmakers are known to tinker with blockbusters until the very last minute, honing in on what audiences respond to in the teaser material. That’s obviously not the case here, since you held back so much in the film’s trailers. How did this lack of advance audience feedback impact the filmmaking process, if at all?<br/></b><i>Anthony Russo (co-director, the taller brother):</i> Look, at the end of the day, my brother and I, we came to this material because we’re fans. We grew up loving the comics. We came to the MCU already fans of the MCU. So the energy we move on is our own passion and our own excitement, and that’s how we tell stories. We learned long ago that you have to tell stories for yourself. You can’t be thinking about how others might receive them.</p><p>So for Joe and me, because we have such an intimate relationship with the material, because we have so many amazing collaborators—starting with Kevin [Feige, producer]—we are able to really fashion the story around what we want to see as fans. How do we surprise ourselves. How do we excite ourselves? How do we challenge ourselves? How do we force ourselves to keep digging deeper and keep exploring this narrative and these characters in ways we never imagined? That’s sort of how we guide ourselves through the process.</p><p>And once the film is complete and we put it out into the world, we really have no idea how it is going to be received. Once that complete film is experienced and digested and responded to, I think that’s the moment where we are then filled up with a reaction. But as we’re executing, once we conceive the film and start executing, we’re not really second-guessing what we’re doing. We’re really focused on chasing the initial vision that we had for it.</p><p><b>On how the Russo brothers are feeling now that they are near the end of the journey:<br/></b><i>Joe Russo (co-director):</i> This is, I think, a really unique experiment in movies, this grand mosaic. Depending on how you count it up, eleven franchises… have been interwoven into one big narrative, and I think a lot of people have invested a lot of heart and soul into the characters. When we take these movies around the world, it’s really heartwarming to see people come up to you and say “hey, I started watching this with my classmates when I was ten years old—now we’re all 21 and we’re all going to go see this together” or “my parents have taken me to every movie” or “my grandfather has taken me to every film”. It’s a real sense of community and sharing in these stories and believing in them. And I think with <i>Endgame</i>, we get the opportunity to finish off one of the grandest experiments in movie history and bring it to, as Kevin said, an epic conclusion. So what we’re hoping for is that people feel satisfied with the conclusion.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On what it’s like to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this critical moment:<br/></b><i>Brie Larson (Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel):</i> I mean, stressful, now that you put it like that. I’ve felt kind of chill. But now I’m scared. So I hope you guys did a good job. I came at just the most magical time I think. To come exactly at this ten-year anniversary, and really, my first introduction to everyone was the ten-year photo, which was a really remarkable and special day. And super surreal and also like not allowed to [be talked about]. So the whole thing has always felt like a dream.</p><p>This film will always be personally dear to me because it was my first time playing Captain Marvel. We shot this first. So I had to stumble and try to figure out who this character was with no script for this and no script for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/captain-marvel/\">Captain Marvel</a></i> either—and perform for the first time in front of legends. But it was incredible.</p><p>As big as it is, it still feels like a bunch of kids. Just like what I was doing over summer break, making movies in my garage. There is still this sense of wonder and play and encouragement—and of course this film deals with some heavy subject matter. So you’re bouncing in between things that feel very deep and serious, and then we’re going off and playing Boggle. Which I am very good at. Just to be clear.</p><p>There is no other word I can describe it as other than surreal. And I’m super excited for this to come out. Mostly just so that I can talk about it. I want to be able to talk about my experience, which I haven’t been able to do for a very long time.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On connection to his fellow Avengers:<br/></b><i>Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk):</i> It doesn’t feel like family to me because we all really get along well. There’s not that much drama. It <i>does</i> feel like family. It’s a family that you <i>wish</i> you had in a way. I don’t know if you could tell, but it’s a little bit different press conference than the last time. It has a little bit sort of sadness to it. We’re all talking about like we’re dead. I loved working with these guys. It was great knowing them. They were great Boggle players.</p><p>There is something very bittersweet about this moment, because as actors, we’re like vagabonds. We kind of bounce around. We have these intense relationships. And then you don’t see anybody until you get nominated for something or you’re nominated in something and you end up in an award ceremony.</p><p><i>Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America):</i> What’s that like? Speak for yourself.</p><p><i>MR:</i> Well. But like, this is the closest thing that any of us really have to—unless you’re in several franchises—it’s the closest thing you have to continuity and friendships and watching people grow up and have children and get married and then get divorced and then get remarried.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>On how Captain America’s leadership role is affected by the presence of other leaders like Black Panther and Captain Marvel:<br/></b><i>CE: </i>I think he tends to lean on those people who are of like mind and nature, who kind of are intrinsically selfless. I mean, all the heroes up here have their baked-in-the-cake flaws. And I think a lot of that makes for really good conflict in storytelling. That’s why my favorite stuff in this arc has been my stuff with Downey, because [there is] such a dichotomy between how we approach things. But at the end of the day, our hearts are both in the right places. It provides a lot of great friction. By introducing characters like Captain Marvel and Black Panther, people who also align very similarly to Cap’s nature, it reinforces Cap’s sense of purpose and home. It’s an environment that… feels more natural for him. It’s nice to see the certain pockets where he feels at peace and the certain pockets where he feels his buttons might be getting pushed.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>On the evolution of the franchise’s female roles:<br/></b><i>Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow):</i> Initially, the character really started as a sort of sexy secretary with a skill-set on the side. Posing as. And we didn’t know, or I certainly didn’t know how the audience would react to the character, my interpretation of the character. And obviously a very beloved character for a long time. Then the next time that we saw her in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-avengers-2012/\">Avengers</a></i>, she was sort of one of the boys for better or worse. And that made sense then.</p><p>I think the fans and the audiences have really pushed, certainly Marvel, but pushed <i>all</i> the studios and filmmakers to really throw up on the screen what represents what’s going on in the zeitgeist and wanting to see diverse films and casts that represent their own aspirations and how they feel. I feel the character has sort of grown in reaction to that. And the movies have really grown in reaction to that kind of fan encouragement.</p><p>I remember when Lizzie [Olsen, Scarlet Witch] signed on. Cobie [Smulders, Agent Maria Hill] was there. We were all clinging to each other… I felt like I had been in this testosterone fest for such a long time, it was so nice to see other female cast members. And then with Brie [Larson] coming on and Karen [Gillan, Nebula from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy/\"><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></a>] and Danai [Gurira, Okoye from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/black-panther-2018/\"><i>Black Panther</i></a>]. I’m amongst so many wonderful actors, so many strong actors, and it’s just grown beyond my wildest dreams. I could never have imagined where this would take us. And all of us. It’s been quite a journey.</p><p><b>On how Robert Downey Jr. felt while filming the now-iconic scene in which Spider-Man (Tom Holland) fades away at the end of <i>Infinity War</i> (“Mr Stark, I don’t feel so good”):<br/></b><i>Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man):</i> I just love the lighting in that scene. I look so shredded. I was more shredded than a julienne salad, man. No. I make a lot of faces. I need some help in the editing. It was one of those moments. “This is the most serious thing that’s happened since you were nine. Now don’t F this up.” And I remember the brothers were there. I think we re-staged it once or twice. Anyway. It was crazy to shoot it. But it was just another day. But then I think seeing it—I happened to see it with this amazing kid, this Scottish kid who couldn’t go to a theater—I saw it with him and his reaction really f’ed me up.</p><p>So I think what a lot of us are looking forward to—like Kevin always says—is that it’s a surprising, delightful experience with <i>Endgame</i>. It’s one of those things where you go “Wow, I think we just made a pretty serious choice here”. But I think audiences liked that. I think audiences are so smart now so they require to not be fed the same drivel as even 20 minutes ago. It’s like we need novelty. And I think that what the Russos and Kevin have been able to do that is provide that in spades.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>On what’s been special about Chris Hemsworth’s journey with these films:<br/></b><i>Chris Hemsworth (Thor):</i> Well, just to echo something you were saying before, Anthony, about the first time that the Marvel Universe came into my universe back in Australia: I was sitting there, and I would have been just straight out of high school and watching <i>Iron Man</i> and thinking the same thing. Thinking “Oh my god, imagine. I wish I could be a part of that world”. And then a few years on, getting cast in it as Thor and having the opportunity to embark on this thing, and at the time I thought, was this film even going to make it past DVD? Or make to the cinemas? Or was I going to be re-cast and all those sort of questions.</p><p>I think the answer to the question, what made it so special for me was just the different people I was able to work with. From Kenneth Brannagh—that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thor/\">first film</a> was really sort of completely in his hands, and he was basically willing to do whatever it takes and wherever he needed me to go for the character—and then through the films with each director and each different cast member, I would learn something different from them.</p><p>And by <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thor-ragnarok/\">Ragnarok</a></i>, I felt like I finally had enough sort of confidence to go “Okay, what is it that I could possibly bring to this?” And then have this great collaboration with Taika [Waititi, director]. We really decided to do something different to see how we could make it unexpected and unique. And then I had been calling Joe and Anthony and saying look, I’ve got this new version of Thor that we’ve just shot. And I want to continue that version. I don’t want to do the old version. And they said we’ve got an even newer version for you.</p><p>It’s just about the people that’s made it so special and I think unique each time with any of our characters. The fact that we’re all willing to be open to what new possibilities lie ahead of these franchises and these characters. It’s been a pretty remarkable journey.</p>"

Minghella developed and produced <i>Teen Spirit</i> with his old friend, actor Jamie Bell (<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/billy-elliot/\"><i>Billy Elliot</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/king-kong-2005/\"><i>King Kong</i></a>), so when he says “we”, it’s Bell he’s referring to.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>How did you know the drama of this film would go beyond the usual drama that feeds the kind of reality shows it takes place around?<br/></b><i>Max Minghella:</i> You don’t know. You hope. It’s interesting because I don’t know how interested I was really in reality shows. I mean, I love reality shows, but it wasn’t what I was really thinking about making this movie. I was kind of fascinated by the mechanics behind them, what we don’t see, and I’m always interested in back rooms. I’ve always been a very voyeuristic person—that’s quite evident in the film. I love seeing things I’m not supposed to see, and the movie almost takes place exclusively in those sorts of spaces. </p><p>There’s a lot going on thematically in the movie between these people. I think the relationship is quite unique and unconventional for a film like this. We’re constantly trying to subvert the poppiness of it. Like the music does in the film, which is very melancholic, [the music is] very kind of candy-colored. There’s two things which should be diametrically opposed, yet they turn into something that’s quite cinematic.  </p><p>I really wanted this movie to be a big cinematic experience. Movies right now are in a difficult moment, and we really hope that this will be a film that can play as a theatrical experience, and make people wanna go and see it on the big screen. Those are the movies I love. It’s a medium I love so much. That’s my church.<br/></p><p><b>The songs feel very deliberate. How much freedom did you have to choose the ones you wanted?<br/></b>We wrote all the songs that you see in the movie into the original script. And we didn’t think we were gonna get them. To be honest this movie never felt real. That’s the honest truth. I didn’t feel as if this movie could happen at any point, until we were shooting. It felt ridiculous. There’s too much music. It’s got subtitles in it. It’s about an immigrant. There’s a thousand things about it that don’t feel plausible. It’s not a hundred-million-dollar Fox movie, it doesn’t feel as if the house was riding on it, so there was no reason not to be crazy. Because it didn’t feel like it would ever happen.</p><p>We were very, very lucky—every movie’s a miracle, our miracle was music. And the fact that [<i>Teen Spirit</i> producer] Fred [Berger] happened to have made <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/la-la-land/\"><i>La La Land</i></a>, which he wasn’t even making at the time that we met him. He happened to go and make this film while we were writing <i>Teen Spirit</i>. It happened to work. It happened to involve Interscope Records. The songs that we had in our script happened to be with Interscope Records, 90 percent of them. It wasn’t planned. We don’t know anything about music. We were just going “we like this one, and this one” and it all happened to be the same place, and it happened to be a place that we had to go. So it worked out. If Sony BMG or somebody had released the soundtrack, this movie would be full of completely different songs, and not the ones we wanted.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Elle Fanning is so powerful in this, yet so subtle at the same time.<br/></b>It’s a deeply nuanced performance for a film like this, and that’s what’s brave about it. She doesn’t do any of the ostentatious things or the loud things that people react to. People like acting when they see the “acting”. Those tend to be the kind of performances that are rewarded or applauded. It’s quite brave to take a role like this, which can be very showy and takes a lot of emotional range, and then not ever take the obvious hit. Never. She does what I think is always the most human honest choice in those moments.</p><p><b>Does it concern you or did it occur to you that <i>Teen Spirit </i>is coming out amongst a rash of movies about pop stars? <i>Her Smell</i>, <i>Vox Lux</i>, <i>A Star Is Born…</i><br/></b>It wasn’t like we were aware that everybody was making music movies. We’re friends with Brady Corbet, <a href=\"http://news.letterboxd.com/post/181093341708/pop-star\">who made</a> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/vox-lux/\"><i>Vox Lux</i></a>, so I was very aware of Brady’s movie, and he’s somebody I hugely admire and have a constant dialogue with. But I also knew how different it was. So I wasn’t nervous about it. We’re very close to the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-star-is-born-2018/\"><i>A Star Is Born</i></a> people, in fact they made both these movies, Interscope, so they’re actually kind of almost like a part of the same team, so it doesn’t feel competitive with them at all, it’s always felt very supportive. And Alex [Ross Perry], who made <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/her-smell/\"><i>Her Smell</i></a>, is a friend of mine. So none of it feels antagonistic.</p><p>What’s so fascinating is they’re so completely different. A lot of them have female protagonists. I don’t think anyone has said “this movie looks like this movie or feels like this movie”. It just goes to show you can give four people similar ingredients and they will absolutely not make the same movie. It’ll just turn into something very different. I feel like now there’s a huge appetite for films like this, an increasing appetite.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>The reality show elements in the film feel highly authentic.<br/></b>I researched the actual truth. Everything that happens with [<i>Teen Spirit</i> judge/producer] Rebecca [Hall]’s character was very grounded in reality, that is sort of what happens on these shows, and I wanted all of it to be: what would happen? And how would these two people react to those things? The thing we studied the most was music tour documentaries, I would say. Like the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/madonna-truth-or-dare/\">Madonna movie</a>, and the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/katy-perry-part-of-me/\">Katy Perry documentary</a>, those are beautifully made. The behind-the-scenes stuff is so endlessly compelling and cinematic to me.</p><p><b>You’ve said that you wrote Zlatko’s role with him in mind—why did you want him in your movie?<br/></b>I’d just seen him in stuff, and he’s so unique. And if you’re going to do a Cinderella story and have a Fairy Godmother, he seems like a really unique way of doing a Fairy Godmother. I genuinely don’t think anyone else could’ve played the part.</p><p><b>Why did you choose to set it on the Isle of Wight?<br/></b>Well, my dad’s from the Isle of Wight, so that was sort of just a silly narcissistic thing. And then I think it’s a good metaphor. This girl is on an island, away from something, a place she wants to be. Looking at a horizon that she can’t quite reach, it’s another layer of alienation, which makes sense to me.</p><p><b>How do you feel now that <i>Teen Spirit</i> is being shown to audiences?<br/></b>It feels so masturbatory making a film, it really does. And I’m extremely happy with where we’ve gotten to with it. It’s the film I wanted to make. For better or worse. And it’s lovely to share it with people. But at the end it is a slightly selfish exercise I think. I’m at peace with what I’ve made. I feel good. And now I’d like to move on and start thinking about something else. But it feels good to have finished this process—I don&rsquo;t think we squandered it and didn’t waste people’s time. It’s a lot of people’s energy, a lot of people’s hard work and kindness. You make a movie and a hundred people are going too far and doing too much for you and not sleeping enough and you want to be responsible to those people.</p>"

The film is an authentic character dramedy that captures the contradictory frustrations of family relationships.</p><p>Pantera sat down with Letterboxd in Austin soon after the film’s SXSW premiere, and proved as cool in real life as her name sounds. Very few people could seamlessly drop into conversation that they used to play the electric cello, but with Pantera, it made perfect sense.</p><p><b><i>Mother’s Little Helpers</i> concerns a topic that has made for some fascinating ensemble performances on film through the years—how modern day grown-ups interact with their parents.<br/></b><i>Kestrin Pantera</i>: I think it’s so fascinating—how do you deal with a parent that wasn’t really a parent, more like your friend’s drug dealer? I remember the first time my mom said “cool”, because parents didn’t used to say stuff like “cool”. When my parents started talking like me when I hit my 30s, it was so weird. My husband’s family, who this film was inspired by, they were cool. My parents aren’t cool. What is it like having cool parents? Well, it’s a mixed bag.</p><p><b>So the real life elements of this story come from your husband’s family?<br/></b>We had been doing RVIP events in Austin for ten years, and [my husband] Jonathan’s dad, he was our runner. That was how I formed a relationship with this dude, he sang karaoke and helped move our shit in a truck. He would come to Burning Man with us, he was like this awesome cool dad. But then when he got sick, there was a lot of reluctance from his kids to come home, and I was like, “What the fuck is wrong with you? He’s awesome!” And then I was like, “Ooooohhh, maybe if he’s <i>not</i> your dad he’s awesome.”</p><p><b>Is that why the film is set in Austin?<br/></b>It was [also] inspired by when I had real life experiences in Austin. I used to tour in rock bands. In my 20s I would bring my electric cello out here and play shows and drink all day and party all night. There’s a fun charm to it. And my family’s from the south as well, so for me, homecoming and dealing with extended family lives in the world of the south. And it’s got that outlaw-country Willie Nelson vibe and ethos. Austin has just got that soulful vibe, it reminds you of the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-allman-brothers-band-live-at-the-beacon-theatre/\">Allman Brothers</a>, or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/if-i-leave-here-tomorrow-a-film-about-lynyrd-skynyrd/\">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/stand-by-your-man/\">Tammy Wynette</a> or Wanda Jackson.</p><p><b>Your co-stars are credited as co-writers on this film—is that to reflect the degree of improvisation?<br/></b>That’s a convention in filmmaking that I think I would like to democratize a little bit. It is really cool to just be like, “I wrote this—a Kestrin Pantera show”, as I did with my first movie [2014’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lets-ruin-it-with-babies/\">Let’s Ruin It With Babies</a></i>], but that movie was improvised and everyone made up all their shit and I just took credit for it. Any movie that has improvised performances, the editor is really the writer. I wrote it, because I edited the pieces together.</p><p>I think every actor really wants to have input into their dialogue. So why not just have really good actors and let them say whatever the fuck they want and also give them credit for that? I wrote the outline, I wrote the story, I wrote the characters, I wrote their back stories, but then we all came together as a team and filled it with their own lives. Also, I conned them into doing a movie for very little-to-no money, so why not be generous with credit? I feel like improvisers should get a little bit more credit for the writing that they do. It’s not a manifesto, it just felt like the polite thing to do when these people were giving everything to me.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>How smooth was the process of discovering the dialogue with the other actors as you went along?<br/></b>In my mind, I knew what was happening because I was thinking about the edit. And the actors were generally confused because they didn’t have that picture as clearly in their mind as clearly as I did, even though everyone had the outline and everything. Most of [the improv] happened on camera, and if someone said something that was wrong, I would just be like, “No, no, no, this way.” I would just side bark. We would shoot a really sloppy first take, 300 percent too long and everyone would be figuring it out as they were going along. But then we’d figure out the shape of the scene in that first take, and be like, “Keep that, keep that, lose this part.” I would always just be thinking about that master sequence in my [Adobe] Premiere timeline. People were really flexible.</p><p><b>Did you have existing relationships with all the actors?<br/></b>Everyone was my friend, except for Melanie, who I’d met once. Breeda and I would go to parties together. We all sang karaoke together in the RVIP Lounge, so that was our core “patient zero” relationship. Milana and I would do excursions with one another, we took a class together, Breeda’s just one of my favorite, weirdest people. And Dave Guintoli [who plays Sadie’s husband], I was in an acting class with when I first moved to Los Angeles. It was literally just having the balls to call the most talented people I knew and just hope that they didn’t laugh in my face.</p><p><b>A press release for this film stated the “production was helmed entirely by women”—was that by design?<br/></b>It was an accident. It just happened that way, and I loved it. It was directed and written by a woman, the camera department was led by a woman, all of our producers and production team were women, our post-supervisor, up until the home stretch, was a woman. Pretty much everyone behind the camera in any leadership role, was a female.</p><p>Hiring moms I think is the smartest thing to do because moms are really good at multi-tasking and keeping zen and dealing with big emotions while showing up on time, and like, delivering the shit. I feel like after you have kids, everything else seems like it’s for fucking pussies. Everything else is fucking bullshit. You and your brunch—fuck you! Obviously I wouldn’t be biased against hiring someone based on whether or not they have children. But I noticed that the moms were the most responsible and effective and showed up early and actually anticipated the needs of everyone in a way that I’d never experienced before.</p>"

Its message resonates to this day. There’s a moment where Maxine Peake’s matriarch Nellie calculates that her youngest daughter will be 85 in the year 1900 and hopes that the world will be a better, fairer place for her by then. The sad truth is we’re still waiting for that equal society.”</p><p>Or as Matt Lynch <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/colonelmortimer/film/peterloo/\">put it</a>, this is “Mike Leigh’s Ken Loach movie”.<br/></p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>To mark the opening of <i>Peterloo </i>in American theaters, Mike Leigh shared a list of his favorite historical dramas with us. See <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/mike-leighs-favorite-historical-dramas/\">the list</a> on the site, or read on for the low-down.</p><p><h2>Mike Leigh’s Favorite Historical Dramas</h2></p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/napoleon/\">Napoleon</a> </i></b>(1927)<br/><i>Directed by Abel Gance</i></p><p>Five-and-a-half-hour-long silent era classic. Only covers part of the story as Gance planned to make five sequels. He didn’t. Don’t let the running time put you off, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/plain_simple_t/film/napoleon/\">says</a> member Plain_Simple_T, “It may have an epic length but hardly a single minute is wasted; this is a powerful, rousing and cleverly directed film with an excellent Carl Davis score that enlightens, awes and entertains.”</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-private-life-of-henry-viii/\">The Private Life of Henry VIII</a></i> </b>(1933)<br/><i>Directed by Alexander Korda</i></p><p>Legendary British actor Charles Laughton, who later directed the all-time classic <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-night-of-the-hunter/\">The Night of the Hunter</a></i>, gave arguably his most iconic performance (okay, after <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mutiny-on-the-bounty/\">Mutiny on the Bounty</a></i>) in this biopic of the King who couldn’t stop getting married. “One of my favorite renditions of this period. Very funny, very true, and great characters,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/rosieroobud/film/the-private-life-of-henry-viii/\">writes</a> member rosieroobud.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/i-am-cuba/\">I Am Cuba</a></i></b> (1964)<br/><i>Directed by Mikhail Kalatozov</i></p><p>This Soviet-Cuba film comprises four vignettes set in the final days of the Batista regime, and was designed as a pro-Castro piece of filmmaking. Famous for its innovative cinematography, as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/oscarkit316/film/i-am-cuba/2/\">described eloquently</a> by member Oscar Lau: “The virtuoso camera work flowed, twirled, descended, arose, marched, without physical and cerebral restriction.”</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/barry-lyndon/\">Barry Lyndon</a></i></b> (1975)<br/><i>Directed by Stanley Kubrick</i></p><p>Another film known for its cinematography, Stanley Kubrick infamously lit this movie so that it looked like only candlelight was being used. It’s one of his least seen, but most acclaimed, films, and its reputation grows with every passing year. “Absolute masterpiece! Hilarious and mesmerizing. I have so many thoughts but need to watch it again to clarify everything!” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tommygroove/film/barry-lyndon/\">enthuses</a> member tommygroove. Mike Leigh himself said in an interview with <i>Creative Screening</i> that Stanley Kubrick’s 1975 classic is “a great film with a great script, drawn from a literary source obviously, and very integrated”.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-tree-of-wooden-clogs/\">The Tree of Wooden Clogs</a></i></b> (1978)<br/><i>Directed by Ermanno Olmi</i></p><p>Of this Palme d’Or-winning film about farm life in late 19th-century Italy, Mike Leigh once said: ”<i>The Tree of Wooden Clogs</i> is a film about man and place, environment, seasons, the passing cycle of things; it’s about power, class, religion and faith; love, superstition and journeys; life and death.” So basically the <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>of 1978.<br/><br/>It’s a hefty list, but we’d expect nothing less from a filmmaker as serious and notable as Mike Leigh. Thanks Mike! Now do the right thing and add these to your watchlists.</p>"

Our producer Christopher Alender, who is also alumni of FSU, saw the short and encouraged her to expand it into a feature. So Teresa had written this script prior to me coming on board.</p><p>Chris and I worked together on another documentary project and he thought I might be a good fit to direct, so I read the script and I loved it. I then met Teresa and I think we shared the same visions for what the film could ultimately be. We did a couple of polished passes together and then we were shooting later that year. It all came together organically based on prior relationships and all of us believing in the story.</p><p><b>What did you connect to the most about the script?<br/></b>I loved that it was a Western and that it was focusing on a female character, which was not something that I felt like we’d seen much before. I also loved that Teresa was inspired by these actual accounts of women who were homesteading at that time, since I was fascinated with the American West as a teenager and had actually picked up some of the books that she used as original research.</p><p>I thought it was fun how Teresa was starting with something rooted in reality and taking it to a horror and supernatural place. But the thing that really I think hooked me after I read it was that I thought the protagonist Lizzy was so well developed, and I thought all the character arcs were really strong. I felt that the horror was coming from the dramatic strengths of the characters’ relationships and their own personal struggles. It felt like really strong ground.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>You had more of a background in documentary filmmaking before this—what compelled you to make a start in fictional narratives? Do you feel being an ‘outsider’ to the genre aided your vision of the film?<br/></b>That’s an interesting question. I had been working in documentary films for many years and I feel that was great preparation for making a narrative film despite the differences. Both my parents were actors so I had grown up around theater and fiction filmmakers my whole life. So I think that it felt like something I had always wanted to eventually get to.</p><p>I’m so fascinated with our world that I think documentary is such an interesting lens to explore things that are happening. But to then be able to step into a fictional realm I think you can explore the human experience to an even greater extreme. Once we started shooting, the process of working with the actors was even more enriching and incredible than I ever could have anticipated.</p><p><b>What were your film influences for <i>The Wind</i>—especially the specific horrors and Westerns that inspired the look and the feel?<br/></b>I think that one of the things that [director of photography] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/lyn-moncrief/\">Lyn Moncrief</a> and I really wanted to do was pay homage to some of the frames from Westerns that have become such big cultural references in our lives. But we wanted to find ways that we could have a fresh take with that [and] subvert it to give a new perspective to the landscape, since we were telling this from a female unreliable narrator and I think that both of those things in Westerns are pretty hard to come by. So, in that sense, I liked how we basically turned the camera 90 degrees and held on the women as the men rode off to town. I was really inspired by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-searchers/\"><i>The Searchers</i></a> (1956), for example.</p><p>In terms of the horror I feel that there is a comparison to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shining/\"><i>The Shining</i></a> (1980) in the sense of how it’s a slow burn where the environment is coming in on our lead character. Pacing-wise, in building up the tension, I was really inspired by that. I thought <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/carrie-1976/\"><i>Carrie</i></a> (1976) was also a really interesting reference in terms of the horror. The first horror scene is simply Sissy Spacek getting her period in a girls locker room and it’s completely terrifying.</p><p>I thought so many of the things that women experience in this time were horrific and yet they were just coming out of the mundane day-to-day life events of trying to live and sustain in such an inhospitable land at that time. I love that <i>The Wind</i> was taking the horror cues from the everyday things that we all experience.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Caitlin Gerard’s performance is truly terrific. She anchors the film brilliantly as it jumps from its time periods. What drew you to her in the casting process and did she bring anything new to what had already been set in the script?<br/></b>During auditions I kept asking for more people because I really didn’t feel like we found our Lizzy yet. Caitlin was one of the last ones and was so balls-to-walls, showing such range in three different scenes. We just wouldn’t be able to fully enter this world without hanging our hat on a lead actress who didn’t have that level of grit. So that was incredible.</p><p>One of the most important things that she brought to the table was the fact that she had a German background, which we didn’t consider before in terms of Lizzy. I had initially been talking to Teresa about Lizzy’s background, thinking that it would make sense for her to be an immigrant, which was very common of that period. To implement that in the script would really add to the isolation that she might be feeling on the land, in this country, and also between her and Isaac [her husband, played by Ashley Zukerman].</p><p>We wrote that into the script days before shooting and then were continuing to work on it throughout the shoot. I thought that was such a nice brush stroke and dimension that Caitlin was able to add because she speaks German and it was fabulous.</p><p><b>What motivated the nonlinear structure of the film? Did you have to adjust anything in the edit to make a particular section work better from how it was laid out in the script?<br/></b>Teresa had already tapped into establishing the nonlinear structure of the film beforehand in a way that would reflect the mental fractured-ness of Lizzy’s headspace. I think it really helps us feel the unreliable narrator so strongly. But we did have to juggle some of the order in post so the edit is different from the order of the script, but I think we were able to find the essence of the script at the end of the day. Those were decisions based on logistics like the performances and the coverage, or the sound and special effects. You just need to recalibrate to keep the pacing in the edit.</p><p><b>Were there any notable challenges on set, such as dealing with the period setting or shooting in such a remote location?<br/></b>We really lucked out in the sense that we got a really strong and dedicated team. I think that everyone was so committed and so talented that we were pretty flexible when challenges would come up. The remoteness really added to the production because we were all able to immerse ourselves in that time period and in that world and not be as connected to the outside and technology.</p><p>I’m sure our producers would have a different story to tell because not being able to access your email onset is a nightmare. Basically none of our cellphones worked in these locations. Despite the problems, there were great benefits in shooting in the middle of nowhere.</p><p><b>Through the film, you use the realities of settler life for horror and tension, such as the wild animals, the lack of medical care and, obviously, the weather. How did you negotiate the balance between the realities and the supernatural, especially since you often leave questions unanswered with the latter?<br/></b>We really wanted to start in a way that let you experience the environment as it was, and then start to get in a place where you experience the environment through Lizzy’s point of view, letting it really rev up into something that was ultimately quite terrorizing. I think we were trying to push the natural elements into a more hyper-realized place so it was close to a supernatural place. It’s like playing a piece of music where it flows from the peaks and the valleys.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Can you describe the decision-making process around how you kept the ‘monster’ hidden as much as possible? It’s very effective, but also lends itself to questions on the specifics.<br/></b>How the haunting element would be both seen and heard was something we were talking about even in the script rewriting stages, and I think we wanted to really lean into all of this being an extension of the torment that Lizzy was feeling internally. So questioning whether or not there was actually a “boogeyman” out there was more interesting and more true to the character than actually seeing the “boogeyman”.</p><p>But the other element of it was that since this was set in the late 1800s I think we really wanted to show and hear hints of it that were coming from the natural world, so “the wind” and how that transformed was really the scary element of the sound design. In terms of the visuals, we were leaning into shadows and elements of fire and dust and things that were of that environment. I wanted to do something that felt practical even when it wasn’t.</p><p><b>I’d like to ask you how you feel the film operates as a period piece to reflect current times. I felt that the way Lizzy is constantly wielding her shotgun is an empowering and feminist subversion of the masculine individualist gunslinger from classic westerns. Were you consciously revising frontier myth in that cinematic sense?<br/></b>I think we were consciously doing that but I don’t think it was the overt intention of the script, which is what I really liked about it. I felt that all of those things were coming out so naturally and they weren’t forced. What’s so interesting with Lizzy is that we spend so much time with her while she’s by herself, but she’s constantly trying to put on a brave face for her husband, or for her neighbors, and for the outside world, which I think we can all relate to.</p><p>And then to be able to see her for who she really is when she’s by herself is such a powerful thing since it turns out that she’s a real badass. She’s wielding the gun, she’s doing all that stuff that she needs to do out of necessity, but it’s also without any pretense and without having to be a certain thing to any certain person because she’s ultimately there being herself and trying to survive.</p><p><b>I feel it resonates in the #MeToo era in the way she’s threatened by powerful forces and then the man in her life doesn’t believe her.<br/></b>Yeah, I think it does and I love that about it. If we’d made it five years ago it still would have resonated. It’s also a very human experience that she’s going through and our current times are shedding light on it in different ways and that’s so cool. I think the horror genre is able to put a mirror up to ourselves in such a powerful way.</p><p>‘<i>The Wind’ opens in US cinemas on limited release 5 April 2019.</i></p>"

No surprise that when La Cinémathèque Française, Paris’s crown jewel of film history, hosts a festival dedicated to retrospective and restored cinema, it goes all out.</p><p><!-- more --></p><!--figure[1]--><p>Toute la Mémoire du Monde occurs over five days, but that’s the only thing that’s small about it, with over 100 films on offer spread over several venues across town. There’s also a parrain du festival, a celebrated guest of honor. This year: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nicolas-winding-refn/\">Nicolas Winding Refn</a>, presenting some of his own films, some films he loves, and a selection of films from his streaming site <a href=\"https://bynwr.com/\">byNWR</a>. Other guests included directors Jerzy Skolimowski and James Ivory, cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, and several film historians.</p><p>The festival screens films every film fan knows (<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alien/\"><i>Alien</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/philadelphia/\"><i>Philadelphia</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shining/\"><i>The Shining</i></a>), films that are under the radar but holy grails to dedicated cineastes (Andy Warhol’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/chelsea-girls/\"><i>Chelsea Girls</i></a>, Francis Ford Coppola’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/one-from-the-heart/\"><i>One From The Heart</i></a>) and films so little-seen that they were met with a blank stare: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/les-mouettes/\"><i>Les Mouettes</i></a> (Maurice Mariaud, 1917, which at the time of writing had been logged exactly zero times on Letterboxd); <i>Le Marchand de Poison aka Big Jim Garrity</i> (George Fitzmaurice, 1916, which is not in our database but is mentioned in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/talisencrw/list/insignificant-but-nonetheless-necessary-for-1/\">this list of silents</a>), and Herbert Kline’s 1940 documentary <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lights-out-in-europe/\"><i>Lights Out In Europe</i></a>. Only a couple dozen die-hard cineastes showed up for those vintage picks, but when it came to the guest of honor, Paris turned out in force.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>Refn.</b><br/>We chose <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/drive-2011/\"><i>Drive</i></a> as our selection from Refn’s retro programme (as the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pusher/\"><i>Pusher</i></a> films, which your correspondent is yet to see, didn’t cater to English speakers). Refn introduced the sold-out screening in English, in the Salle Henri Langlois (the largest of the Cinematheque’s three screens) with his story of meeting Ryan Gosling (who had the rights to <i>Drive</i> and was searching for a director) while he was trying to put together a spy movie with Harrison Ford and simultaneously coming down with a flu, so high on cold medication.</p><p>Letterboxd would like to report that we asked a thoughtful and insightful question on behalf of our readers, but, in what seemed like a noble move, he only took questions from women. This corrective seemed progressive… until he invited the winner of the best question on stage at the end to receive a prize, which was—drumroll please—the opportunity to touch his hand. “This is the softest hand you will ever touch,” he intoned. Weird. <i>Drive</i>: still great, and hearing it loud in a cinema with proper surround really underscores Refn’s fantastic ear for detail.</p><p>His selection of influential films (mostly predictably violent genre fare—alas, he revealed during his Q&amp;A, the Cinematheque didn’t allow him to include <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sixteen-candles/\"><i>Sixteen Candles</i></a>) included one big title I’d never seen, John Huston’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fat-city/\"><i>Fat City</i></a>, featuring a young Jeff Bridges as an up-and-coming boxer and Stacy Keach as the over-the-hill counterpart.</p><p><i>Fat City</i> turns out to be the first film Refn remembers seeing (a well loved 35mm print complete with burned-in French subtitles). He marginally spoiled his upcoming 13-hour Amazon streaming series, <i>Too Old To Die Young</i>, by revealing that he and director of photography <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/darius-khondji/\">Darius Khondji</a> were both fans of <i>Fat City</i> and decided to steal the ending for their series. (It’s not really a spoiler, as <i>Fat City</i> ends on a marvellously ambiguous note. And never mind the name; for anyone who loves boxing films or American 70s cinema, <i>Fat City</i> is up there with the best in either category.)</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>Brown.</b><br/>Another 70s American gem screening at the festival was Hal Ashby’s biography of Woody Guthrie, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bound-for-glory/\"><i>Bound For Glory</i></a>, hosted by one particularly legendary guest: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/garrett-brown/\">Garrett Brown</a>, inventor of the Steadicam. With several films featuring his invention dotted across the program, including <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/marathon-man/\"><i>Marathon Man</i></a>, <i>The Shining</i>, and <i>Philadelphia</i>, I chose this film in part because I recently saw <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hal-2018/\"><i>Hal</i></a>, last year’s documentary on the director, and discovered that <i>Bound for Glory</i> contained the very first Steadicam shot. (It’s a common misconception that <i>The Shining</i> holds this honor; one <i>courageux</i> French audience member interrupted Brown’s opening to attempt to correct him on this point.)</p><p>If you haven’t seen the Steadicam shot that opens <i>Bound For Glory</i>, it’s astonishing—a three-minute take that begins on a crane, descends through a crowd, follows David Carradine through that crowd, and then back. It’s the sort of shot that helped win <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/haskell-wexler/\">Haskell Wexler</a> an Oscar for cinematography (not to discount his work on the rest of the film, obviously).</p><p>Anyway, if you can ever see Brown speak, do so. He’s a garrulous man, generous and proud at the same time, and his masterclass was the highlight of the weekend. Over an hour and a half, he chronicled how he moved from folk singer to industrial filmmaker to inventor to being the man responsible for some of cinema’s most iconic shots. I’ve included some of his stories in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/garrett-browns-iconic-steadicam-shots/detail/\">this list</a> of Brown’s picks for most iconic Steadicam shots.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Brown isn’t a fan of long takes for the sake of them, often highlighting how they can be used more effectively edited with other shots. He’s also not a fan of handheld. In his opinion, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/children-of-men/\"><i>Children of Men</i></a>’s famous handheld work unnecessarily calls attention to itself and suggests the presence of a person, taking away the immediacy from the characters.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>Jodorowsky.</b><br/>The weekend closed out with an in-person appearance by one of my cinematic heroes. I’ve loved Alejandro Jodorowsky ever since I had <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-holy-mountain/\"><i>The Holy Mountain</i></a> dropped on my brain during the wee hours of a 24-hour movie marathon, and when I learned that Refn was programming <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/el-topo/\"><i>El Topo</i></a> with Jodorowsky as his guest, I had to go (even though I’d understand next-to-none of the Spanish-language dialogue… with French subtitles).</p><p>I’d noted earlier in the week that Jodorowsky was thanked in the credits of <i>Drive</i>; ever since that film, <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/23814/1/watch-alejandro-jodorowsky-give-a-tarot-reading\">Jodorowsky gives Refn a tarot reading</a> at the start of every potential project, helping the Danish filmmaker decide whether or not he’ll do the film and if so, what form it should take.</p><p>Stories like that do nothing to reduce Jodorowsky’s mystical reputation, but wearing an aged sweater while standing next to the suit-wearing Refn, he seemed charmingly down-to-Earth, making fun of Refn’s capitalist ways and discussing his recently completed new movie, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/psychomagic/\"><i>Psychomagic</i></a>. At 90 years old, he shows few signs of diminishing.</p><p>Refn says he made Jodorowsky promise he’d be around to 150 so they can be friends when he’s 100. We wouldn’t rule it out.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>Varda.</b><br/>Letterboxd would like to take this moment to note the passing of celebrated French filmmaker <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/agnes-varda/\">Agnès Varda</a>. If you are in or near Paris on Tuesday 2 April, La Cinémathèque Française will host <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cinemathequefr/status/1111969495172739072\">a tribute to her life and career</a> from 11:00am (her funeral will take place the same day, at Cimetière du Montparnasse, at 2:00pm). French speakers will enjoy <a href=\"https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/081908-011-A/lecon-de-cinema-avec-agnes-varda/\">this Varda masterclass</a>, filmed just last year.</p><p>Repose en paix, Agnès.</p><p>Hot tip № 1: If you’re going to Paris to see movies, the Latin Quarter is <i>the</i> place to stay, with several of its most devoted repertory cinemas clustered together. Hot tip № 2: Check out <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mundof/list/deja-vu-a-chronological-history-of-french/\">this evolving list of chronological French cinema</a>.</p>"

I cried during <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/city-of-angels/\">City Of Angels</a></i> (which also led me to <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wings-of-desire/\">Wings Of Desire</a></i> so not all was lost), discovered <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/valley-girl/\">Valley Girl</a></i> when CityTV used to show blocks of old movies every night, and believed <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/trapped-in-paradise/\">Trapped In Paradise</a></i> is one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time (still true). I saw <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bringing-out-the-dead/\">Bringing Out The Dead</a></i> in theaters twice, thought <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/snake-eyes/\">Snake Eyes</a></i> was cool, watched <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/8mm/\">8MM</a></i> on a date, and did a class project on <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/captain-corellis-mandolin/\">Captain Corelli’s Mandolin</a></i>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>I long defended Cage with, “well he has an Oscar,” pointing to <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/leaving-las-vegas/\">Leaving Las Vegas</a> </i>or later, <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/adaptation/\">Adaptation</a>, </i>as proof he can act when he feels like it. Eventually, Cage took on new meaning thanks to memes and an increasingly erratic choice of movie roles, but I kept watching.</p><p>I saw <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mandy-2018/\">Mandy</a></i> because it looked insane. I watched <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-frozen-ground/\">Frozen Ground</a> </i>because Netflix suggested I do so.

I embraced Nicolas Cage more than ever before because the algorithm of Letterboxd convinced me I was heading towards some monumental achievement in which I become a preeminent Cage expert from the comfort of my couch.</p><p>For Letterboxd friends and movie lovers, it has become a point of discussion—is the person you think is your most watched actor of all time really your number one? Is your number one in a precarious position (I see you jockeying for the number two spot, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson)? How many movies featuring one person do you need to watch to have them become your most watched actor of all time—10? 20? 55?</p><p>All I know is this: there are 35 Nicolas Cage movies I still need to see.</p>"

According to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hereditary/film/booksmart/\">Elle</a>, the coming-of-age tale is “a whipsmart and genuinely heartwarming film”, while also being “vulgar and obscene in nature”.</p><p><i>Booksmart</i> was one of two well received SXSW films (alongside <i>Good Boys</i>) for which <i>Superbad</i> (2007) is a clear touchstone. Close observers will note that Beanie Feldstein, who stars in <i>Booksmart </i> alongside Kaitlyn Dever (and is one of our <i>Lady Bird</i> faves), is <i>Superbad</i> star Jonah Hill’s sister.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/us-2019/\">Us</a></b><br/>Directed by Jordan Peele</i></p><p>SXSW’s reputation as a taste-maker for genre films was recognized this year by Jordan Peele, who selected it as the launch pad for his eagerly anticipated follow-up to the phenomenon that was 2017’s <i>Get Out</i>. Letterboxd member Tasha Robinson <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tasharobinson/film/us-2019/\">says</a> the film is “arguably scarier” than <i>Get Out</i>, while David Ehrlich <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/davidehrlich/film/us-2019/\">counters</a> that the film is “a lot funnier than it is frightening—a horror movie for a world in which real life is scary enough on its own”.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-peanut-butter-falcon/\"><b>The Peanut Butter Falcon</b></a><br/>Directed by Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz / Winner: Narrative Spotlight Audience Award</i></p><p>Shia LaBeouf, who’s having <a href=\"http://news.letterboxd.com/post/182411485588/honey-boy\">a hell of a year</a> so far, co-stars in this Mark Twain-referencing drama as a minor outlaw/crab fisherman attempting to help Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a man with Down syndrome, get to a wrestling academy after the latter absconds from the nursing home where he lives. Tom Grey <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tomgrey/film/the-peanut-butter-falcon/\">called it</a> “a touching, charming and nice little film to watch, with strong performances and a lovely relationship between Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen”.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-art-of-self-defense-2019/\"><b>The Art of Self-Defense</b></a><br/>Written and directed by Riley Stearns</i></p><p>Stearns’ heavily stylized follow-up to 2014’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/faults/\">Faults</a></i> stars Jesse Eisenberg as a meek office drone who gets mugged and seeks self-empowerment guidance from a karate sensei named… Sensei (a revelatory Alessandro Nivola). Guaranteed, if not outright designed, to be divisive, it combines deathly dark humor with unexpected jolts of violence while examining the extremes of modern masculinity. Your Letterboxd correspondent is still getting his head around this one. Jacob Knight perhaps <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jacobknight/film/the-art-of-self-defense-2019/\">said it best</a> when he wrote the following: “<i>Cobra Kai</i> got wild after they let Yorgos Lanthimos start directing episodes”. We spoke to Stearns about the film at SXSW—keep an eye out for that interview closer to the film’s general release. </p><!--figure[5]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alice-2019/\"><b>Alice</b></a><br/>Directed by Josephine Mackerras / Winner: Narrative Feature Grand Jury Award</i></p><p>Mackerras’ French-language film took the top narrative prize at SXSW, and it’s being praised for its honest depiction of a woman who turns to prostitution after her husband’s addiction to escorts leaves her and her child penniless. Garrett McDowell <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/garrettmcdowel1/film/alice-2019/\">says</a> the film “offers an acute examination of a motherhood as well as systemic and social gender disparity”.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/yes-god-yes-2019/\"><b>Yes, God, Yes</b></a><br/>Written and directed by Karen Maine</i></p><p>Karen Maine has expanded her <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/yes-god-yes/\">2017 short film of the same title</a> into a feature-length “massive home run”, according to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kelleyrand/film/yes-god-yes-2019/\">Kelley</a>. “It’s quick-witted and hysterical and infuriating and all-too-relatable for an incalculable amount of people.”</p><!--figure[7]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/villains-2019/\"><b>Villains</b></a><br/>Directed by Dan Berk, Robert Olsen</i></p><p>Maika Monroe (<i>It Follows</i>) and Bill Skarsgård (revealing a very different side to the one he showcased as Pennywise in <i>It</i>) star in this twisty thriller as a pair of young criminals on the run who get in over their heads when seeking refuge in a seemingly normal suburban home. For <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jack22/film/villains-2019/\">Jack</a>, it was “the biggest surprise of the fest—witty, entertaining and surprisingly heartfelt”. Elle <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hereditary/film/villains-2019/\">called it</a> “a truly stylish and sleek caper dramedy”. Stay tuned for an interview with directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, right here, very soon.</p><!--figure[8]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/extra-ordinary/\"><b>Extra Ordinary</b></a><br/>Directed by Mike Ahern, Enda Loughman</i></p><p>This Irish comedy starring Maeve Higgins (and Will Forte as… a satanist) “powers on with such confidence and vision and never breaks it for anything”, according to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/andrewh/film/extra-ordinary/\">Andrew</a>. “Taika Waititi meets Yorgos Lanthimos,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/griffschiller/film/extra-ordinary/\">Griffin</a>. </p><!--figure[9]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/saint-frances/\"><b>Saint Frances</b></a><br/>Directed by Alex Thompson / Winner: Narrative Feature Audience Award</i></p><p>Like <i>Alice</i>, a fellow winner in the Narrative Feature section, <i>Saint Frances</i> seeks to portray the societal pressures faced by women that often go unacknowledged in cinema. Kelly O’Sullivan (who also wrote the film) stars as Bridget, who accepts a job nannying the titular six-year-old (Ramona Edith-Williams) after undergoing an abortion. “Delightful, even when melancholic. Ramona Edith-Williams is a star in the making,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ayfilm/film/saint-frances/\">Andy</a>.</p><!--figure[10]--><p><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/boyz-in-the-wood/\"><b>Boyz in the Wood</b></a><br/>Directed by Ninian Doff / Winner: Midnighters Audience Award</i></p><p>Teenage boys on a hike in the Scottish Highlands come under perilous threat in this SXSW favorite that Leon Brill <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/leonbrill/film/boyz-in-the-wood/\">calls</a> “a fun romp through the highlands with a little bit of horror for sport”. William Lindus <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/fundamental/film/boyz-in-the-wood/\">adds</a>: “The laughs are great, the drug trip sequences are bonkers, and the characters surprisingly endearing”. Josh H must also be recognized for his <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/zombeaner/film/boyz-in-the-wood/\">characterization</a> of the film as “The Hills Have Ayes”.</p><h2>Honorable mentions</h2><p>Seth Rogen/Charlize Theron rom-com <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/long-shot-2019/\"><i>Long Shot</i></a>, the Seth Rogen-produced ‘<i>Superbad</i> for 12-year-olds’ <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/good-boys-2019/\"><i>Good Boys</i></a>, and Harmony Korine’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-beach-bum/\"><i>The Beach Bum</i></a>, in which Matthew McConnaughey reverts to his early-2000s persona, all received positive notices at the fest, which is famous for the generosity of its comedy audiences.</p><h2>Most divisive</h2><p>At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/daniel-isnt-real/\"><i>Daniel Isn’t Real</i></a>, which sounds like a combination of <i>Drop Dead Fred</i> and <i>American Psycho</i>, had received the widest spectrum of ratings and reviews, which excites us. “As much of a mind bender as they come… H.P. Lovecraft would be proud” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/slasherreviews/film/daniel-isnt-real/\">SlasherReviews</a>. “Some interesting effects and a cool use of color in the cinematography but boy were there a whole bunch of lens flares,” adds <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/nickstellon/film/daniel-isnt-real/\">Nick</a>. <i>Daniel Isn’t Real</i> won the Excellence in Poster Design award at the SXSW Film Awards (designed by the legendary <a href=\"http://www.4twenty.co.uk/\">Jock from 4twenty</a>).</p><h2>How we picked</h2><p>Because the number of Letterboxd members who were a) at SXSW, b) managed to get to multiple screenings, and c) rated and/or reviewed those films was variable, we compiled this list based on world premiere status, ratings, reviews, tags, appearances in lists, awards received and general noise (on social media and elsewhere) from our community.</p>"

That’s why you might find that your one-sentence preview with a whole bunch of likes has disappeared from the film’s page (for members who don’t follow you).

When we first meet her, Larson’s character is already a super-powered intergalactic badass known as Vers, and a member of the alien Kree Empire-based strike team Starforce, led by her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law).</p><p>A mission brings them to planet Earth in the mid-90s, where Vers meets a somewhat sunnier-than-we’ve-come-to-expect Nick Fury (played by a digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson) and a green young agent named Coulson (Clark Gregg, also digitally de-aged). Here she encounters Maria Rambeau (English actress Lashana Lynch), who has a connection to Vers’ forgotten past as Carol Danvers, test pilot.</p><p>Marvel Studios has once again selected its directorial talent from the world of independent cinema (hello, Taika Waititi), despite the fact that Boden and Fleck’s past filmography contains very little that suggests a proficiency with super-heroics.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>Their last film was the boat-gambling drama <i>Mississippi Grind </i>(which co-starred <i>Captain Marvel </i>scene-stealer Ben Mendelsohn), and they’re probably still best known for 2006’s <i>Half Nelson </i>(directed by Fleck, written by them both), in which Ryan Gosling gave an Oscar-nominated performance as a drug-addicted middle school teacher.</p><p>Nevertheless, it has proven to be another good call on Marvel’s part, as the directing pair has delivered something pretty special here.</p><p>At a recent press event featuring several cast and crew, along with Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige, Larson kicked things off by explaining what about the character appealed to her:</p><p><i>Brie Larson:</i> There’s a lot to love about her, which is why I was really excited to do this. In particular, the idea of playing a superhero, or a female superhero in particular because my interest is in female complexity. I was a little worried about playing a superhero that would be perfect, because I don’t feel like that’s realistic, or something aspirational at all. So getting to play a character where the whole character arc and turn of this is watching her be this major risk taker, which means it’s not always going to work out the best. And those are the moments, the defining moments of her character, where she doesn’t lay down, she gets back up. I mean, that’s everything. That’s for everybody. There isn’t a person who can’t relate to that, I don’t think.</p><p><b>On how Boden and Fleck got the job:<br/></b><i>Kevin Feige:</i> It’s their focus on character. And our belief that they wouldn’t have lost the character, amongst the spectacle and the fun and the effects. Anna spoke very eloquently about Carol Danvers and that female hero. It was those early meetings and their amazing body of work that made us realize they could bring Carol to life.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On making the leap from indies to blockbusters:<br/></b><i>Ryan Fleck:</i> I think in the early conversations with Kevin and with Brie, that’s what we wanted to bring to this story, a continuation of the things we had done in our other movies, which is an intimacy and character-focused storytelling. The visual effects were challenging at first for us, but we were working with the best in the business here and they’ve done, you know, one or two of these movies before we got here. We were in good hands and we were able to lean on them and work very collaboratively with the effects team and learn how that works. And they were patient with us and it was wonderful. I can’t think of a better studio to take that leap with. I mean, they are just the best collaborators at Marvel. They really let us tell the story we wanted to tell.</p><p><b>On what she learned making the film:<br/></b><i>Anna Boden:</i> I think I realized over the course of making this movie that I’m, as a person, kind of more comfortable hiding and not being seen. And I think this process, the whole process has helped me, you know, be more confident in my voice and just be more comfortable. I’m not very comfortable right now; I’ve got to be honest. But a little bit more comfortable just being seen.</p><p><b>On the friendship between Carol and Maria forming the emotional core of the film:<br/></b><i>BL:</i> That’s kind of what we’re talking about in this film, without being too [showboaty] about it, this is the love of the movie; this is the great love. This is the love lost. This is the love found again. This is the reason to continue fighting and to go to the ends of the earth for the person, the thing that you love. And it’s her best friend and her best friend’s daughter. Which to me is so natural. I went and saw the movie with some people and it was like an hour later, they were like, “Oh Maria’s the love.” Like, yeah! So it’s not something that we made a big deal about, but it just feels so natural because that love is so strong.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i>Lashana Lynch:</i> They’re both in the military, so they come from male-dominated environments where they were drawn towards the women. They would find power in whoever they find energetic connections to. I think they had a sarcasm together. Carol is just a normal person. She’s able to be every facet of what a woman represents today—sarcastic, dry, funny—she can kick men down and throw them into different parts of the universe.</p><p><b>On representation in blockbuster cinema:<br/></b><i>BL:</i> I’m just doing what I can do based upon my experience and my one body, which is why representation on screen is so important. Because not one of us can tell the entire story. We can only tell our piece of it. But with films like this that do end up going international—with smaller movies you don’t know; sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t—it means you get to have a really extensive conversation with movies like this and I’m so grateful that this film has so many pockets in it. If you want to just enjoy it, you totally can. But there are a lot of aspects to it that I think are worth, you know, talking with your friends about, talking with your family about—and so when you have a multi-cultural, global conversation like that, I think it allows all of us through the veil of metaphor to be able to reveal some deeper truths and maybe empathize in a new way.</p><p><b>On what she took away from the film:<br/></b><i>LL:</i> My forever appreciation for single mothers, who don’t get enough light shone on them ever. So to be able to have that opportunity to represent them and say like, “I’d kind of like a universal thank you for your work,” was really special. Actually I went to my mum and other mums I know afterwards and was like, “Can I just just say thanks for everything that you’ve done for the last however many years.” And it really goes a long way just to say thank you daily. Because then they’re able to feed back to other mothers and say, you know, we’re actually doing an all right job. We’re actually enough. And so that’s what I’ve taken away. I feel like I’m not only representing women, I’m representing black women. I’m representing single mothers and representing women in the military and that’s pretty damn special.</p><p><b>On working opposite Reggie, the ginger cat who plays Goose, the film’s breakout character and a foil to Nick Fury throughout:<br/></b><i>Samuel L. Jackson:</i> I am not a cat person. But I’m also not a dog, bird or a fish person, either. So I just don’t engage pets. You know, Reggie is like most animals that people bring to set that have been trained to do this, that or the other—he’s snack-oriented. You give him something to eat, he shows up. And there were actually four cats, but Reggie did the majority, he did the heavy lifting most of the time.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>On what they miss most from the 90s:<br/></b><i>RF:</i> VHS tapes.</p><p><i>AB:</i> Pay phones. Because then I wouldn’t have to check my email all the time.</p><p><i>Clark Gregg:</i> I wish MTV had videos again. I mean, not just 90s MC Hammer, which were awesome, but just videos, music videos.</p><p><i>Gemma Chan (Starforce assassin Minn-Erva):</i> <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>.</p><p><i>SLJ:</i> Laser discs.</p><p><i>BL:</i> He is very passionate about laser discs, by the way. That’s not a joke. [Mine is] Butterfly clips.</p><p><i>Jude Law:</i> I was a big fan of the band The Verve. They were The Verve and then they were just Verve. Richard Ashcroft is on his own now. Sad.</p><p><i>LL:</i> R&amp;B. R&amp;B was the truth, man. The truth!</p><p><i>KF:</i> Video stores. I miss walking around video stores.</p>"

      "abstract": "",
      "body": "<p><b>“I just expect it to be exactly what it is and to be there.”</b><br/></p><p>Of the eight Best Picture finalists, <i>Black Panther</i> has been out the longest, had the largest budget, and has done the rounds of the streaming services. It was always gonna take the top spot in a rewatch match. But to figure out the rewatchability of second-place-getter <i>A Star Is Born,</i> we went to the film’s hardest stanner, Juliette, to help us understand why fans keep coming back even though it’s a <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/a-star-is-born-new-zealand-adds-suicide-warning-note-before-movie-1202018466/\">complicated watch</a>.</p><p>While Juliette’s multiple reviews are <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/juliettenoelle/film/a-star-is-born-2018/8/\">meme-tastic, quippy, punctuation-free gems of observation</a>, when we asked her to explain herself, she went remarkably deep. Her replies may just make you want to take another look at Ally and Jack.<i> [Note: this interview contains spoilers for the film’s plot.]</i></p><p><b>How many times do you think you have seen <i>A Star Is Born</i>?<br/></b><i>Juliette:</i> I think I have seen the film sixteen times? I know for certain I have seen it fourteen times in theaters, but I’m not sure how many times I’ve watched it in the comfort of my own home since it’s been released on digital. There’s just something about the energy in a theater while this film is being screened. It gives me chills just thinking about it!</p><!--figure[9]--><p><b>What keeps you coming back to it?<br/></b>It&rsquo;s so hard to pinpoint what exactly it is that draws me back to this film time and time again. I love a good love story when properly executed! I’m kind of obsessed with celebrity culture! I love a great musical! And like many people, the subjects of this film: alcoholism, mental illness, suicide, self-doubt, the cultivation of the self, love, mentorship, and reconciliation of one’s experiences with a flawed parental figure are all things that have permeated my life. Some of these things, I understand and have a firm grasp on, they feel definitive and their impacts are a tangible output. Some of these things, I still grapple with daily. There is little definition, largely just confusion and sporadic outbursts of pain.</p><p>When I return to this film, which I often do, the thing I don’t expect it to give me is answers. I don’t expect the film to be able to define for me what I must come to define for myself. I don’t expect it to clarify my confusion. I don’t expect it to eradicate the pain. I just expect it to be exactly what it is and to be there. </p><p>There’s a scene towards the end of this film where, while mourning the loss of his brother, Bobby explains how he heard one of Jackson’s songs performed at a bar. At first, it angers him. He feels like no one really knew Jackson. But then, something shifts and just hearing the song begins to soothe him. It reminds him that, in spite of their trauma and their turmoil, it isn’t all for nothing. </p><p>That’s what this film is for me. It soothes me. It reminds me that the facilitation of our healing can come through art. It reminds me that for people, who once felt broken and irreparable, it is possible to find love and happiness not just with another person, but within one’s self. It reminds me that our pain and our devastation can be met in equal measure with (and even maybe be overcome by) our brilliance, our triumph, and our devotion to one another.</p><p><b>What have you noticed with each rewatch?<br/></b>What I notice most with each subsequent rewatch of the film is what a massive undertaking the sound editing and mixing for this film must have been. I have such deep and profound respect and admiration for all the work that went into crafting the audio for this film! The film is such a visceral experience, one that truly engages all of the senses. I remember physically recoiling in the theater the first time I heard the sound of Jackson’s tinnitus. I remember feeling my entire seat shake in time with the music during the concert sequences.</p><p>I also have a sincere recommendation! Once you watch the film a few times, I really encourage you to watch the film just through the lens of watching Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real in the background of the pivotal scenes. It adds so much dimension to scenes you thought you already knew! </p><p><b>What is the single greatest scene in this version of <i>A Star Is Born</i>?<br/></b>As clichéd or “basic” as it may seem to say, there is no denying that the greatest scene in this film is when Ally joins Jackson on stage and the two perform <i>Shallow</i> together. It’s a cataclysmic and mesmerizing moment.</p><!--figure[10]--><p>It’s the way Jackson physically steps back and acquiesces his spotlight to new talent. It’s the combination of awe and support in Jackson’s eyes as he watches Ally assume center-stage. It’s the way Ally assumes her place at the mic for the first time. It’s how Ally—all at once terrified, shocked, overwhelmed, empowered, and free—finds a version of herself she had long thought impossible to access under the stage lights. The arc of which is punctuated by Gaga’s impeccable performance in this scene, most noticeably by the shift in her physicality, from her hands covering her eyes, unable to make eye contact, to grabbing the mic and belting her now patented cathartic wail.</p><p>It’s the way, two artists—no, two people—are separated physically on the stage singing into their individual microphones, but slowly find their way to meet in the middle and sing as one. In itself, this scene is the film in miniature. If this scene hadn’t worked, it’s very unlikely the rest of the film would have worked. </p><p>Not to mention, the scene is just absolutely stunning. Of course, the music is heavenly, that’s a given. In terms of the composition, I love how the camera moves around and captures each protagonist in different ways. And the color palette is gorgeous. The way that blue and red light dance around our protagonists throughout the sequence is just jaw-dropping. It’s the kind of high an artist, and in a turn a viewer, could spend their whole life chasing.</p><p><b>What do you wish haters understood about the film’s greatness?<br/></b>My first priority would be to tell the haters that Lady Gaga is <i>not</i> playing herself in <i>A Star Is Born</i>! Just because Gaga is a singer playing a singer, doesn’t mean she isn’t acting!</p><p>Furthermore, to me, it feels unfair that the power of her performance is sometimes diminished just because she sings in the film. Anyone can sing in a way that is technically proficient with enough training, but to tell a story through song? To act a song? To perform with every iota of your being musically? That’s a whole other skill and it is just as worthy of recognition and respect as any other leading performance this year. </p><p>Secondly, I would like to convey that just because something is a remake doesn’t mean that it lacks value or that it lacks something to say. I can’t pinpoint what exactly it is about this story that seems to capture the collective imagination every few decades, but I think it has something to do with how it presents ascension at the expense of descent, art as both artifice and freedom of authentic expression, and love in spite of sacrifice and self-destruction. There’s something about that cocktail that becomes the perfect receptacle for the expression and examination of our cultural anxieties. </p><p>Its malleable formula allows for questions to be asked about how we think about celebrity and fame, the self-identification process, and the value of art. In that sense, a remake of <i>A Star Is Born</i> is vital and refreshing, and certainly not tired and uninspired, and most importantly, it doesn’t lack something to say. It’s inherently reflective of the culture it was created in by its very nature. It allows us to ponder not just how Hollywood tells stories about itself, but also how we tell stories about ourselves. And if you ask me, there’s so much value in that. </p><p><b>What do you think <i>should</i> win Best Picture at this year’s Oscars?<br/></b>Well, I’m clearly biased towards <i>A Star Is Born</i>, but I would not be mad to see <i>Roma</i> or <i>The Favourite</i> walk off with the evening’s top prize!</p><p><b>What do you think <i>will</i> win Best Picture?<br/></b>My heart says <i>Roma</i>, my head says <i>Green Book</i>.</p>"

Grant co-stars in the film as Jack Hock, an acquaintance who becomes Lee’s friend, and eventually her collaborator, via their mutual affection for booze. More than one person has accurately observed that if you dim your eyes, Hock could easily be <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/withnail-i/\">Withnail</a><b>,</b> thirty years later. His Oscar campaign has been one of the most gleeful joys of awards season, and a pleasing reward for an actor who was “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/richard-e-grant-hearts-barbra-streisand\">told right from the get-go that I looked like a tombstone</a>”.</p><p>Mostly taking place in a Manhattan of wood-lined taverns and fusty bookstores, and quietly celebrating some of the city’s longest lasting icons including Julius, the city’s oldest gay bar, <i>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</i> is a minor miracle of a film that represents a new level of achievement for McCarthy.</p><p>The Oscar nomination is not her first (she received a Best Supporting nod for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bridesmaids/\">Bridesmaids</a></i> in 2012), but there’s a complexity to her performance here that makes it undeniably special.</p><p>Director Heller (<i>The Diary of a Teenage Girl,</i> and currently in production on the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl/\">Tom Hanks biopic about Mr Rogers</a>) joined McCarthy to discuss the film at a recent AFI event in Hollywood.</p><p><b>On what made Heller want to direct the film:<br/></b><i>Marielle Heller:</i><b> </b>I found Lee really refreshing. I feel like we have male [lead] characters who are assholes all the time and we find them to be the most interesting characters, and you never get to see women like that. And so there was something about her I just immediately went, ‘Yeah, we need more women like Lee’. Also, middle-aged women who kind of don’t fit into society’s norms. Childless, lesbian. She didn’t fit into the model of what we make movies about, and so I just thought there was something nice and radical to me about that. It shouldn’t be radical, but it felt really radical. There was something about the fact that her intellect and her work is so much more important than her appearance, that I loved. And that she’s genuinely the smartest person in every room, but no one gives her that credit.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p><b>On how McCarthy heard about the role:<br/></b><i>Melissa McCarthy:</i> I had a very quick introduction to Lee. I heard about it first from my husband [Ben Falcone]. There was an earlier incarnation of the movie—movies fall apart all the time for a million different reasons—and my husband had a part in it, the part he ended up playing in this one [of a rare book dealer], and that’s how I read it. We read each other’s scripts and talked about it and after I read it I was like, ‘This is incredible, this is so good and why on earth don’t I know who Lee Israel is?’. I was disappointed with myself that I didn’t know about her.</p><p><b>On McCarthy’s response to the character as written:<br/></b><i>MM:</i> I had a very strong reaction. I was at page twenty and I thought, ‘Oh I like her so much’. And then I had to stop and I went back through the first twenty pages, because I couldn’t figure out why. It was intangible. There’s no moment, there’s no speech. I started to fall in love with her, and that to me was the most exciting thing. I find her intriguing, challenging. I loved that she didn’t need someone else to validate who she was. Even when she is difficult, which is often. I respected her.</p><p>It also just made me think about being so talented at something and being told at 52, ‘You know, we don’t need you to do that anymore. You’re now obsolete.’ So as someone gets better and better and more experienced, the average thing is ‘Now you’re obsolete’. I just found that whole way of thinking so insane, that I thought, what would any of us do if we were pushed to that point? So the more she kind of conned and grifted, I found myself rooting for her.</p><p><b>On how she got into Lee’s headspace:<br/></b><i>MM:</i> I read everything she wrote. I also listened to stories from people who actually knew Lee, and then there is a bit of conjuring. You just wanna do right by the people. The costume and wardrobe department were very important because I had no interest in looking like myself. I think it’s really freeing to get to walk around in other people’s shoes and I think that allows you to be braver and more vulnerable. It’s a very fantastic part of what I do, I think you get to be steadier or more empowered because it’s happening through someone else. It takes the pressure off of me.</p><p>I have a real fascination in what drives us all. What our quirks are. I don’t know any perfect woman, I don’t know how to play pleasant or blonde. Give me a real character like Lee who’s complicated and irritating and smart and all these things that when I look at someone, it makes you kinda fall in love with them. All my friends are nuts. They always need a qualifier like, ‘They’re actually great, just get to know them’. That’s why we love people. You don’t love people because they’re pleasant, you love them because they’ll talk too much or say the wrong thing, but they’ll show up at 3 o’clock when you don’t feel well and help you. It’s so rare that you get to play a woman like that. Those are the women that I know. They’re complicated and challenging.</p><p><b>On Jack and Lee’s friendship:<br/></b><i>MM:</i> They were both so lonely. And it’s such a universal thing. I don’t know a human that hasn’t felt incredibly lonely and undervalued. We are all so lonely. I think everyone can feel that tether to those characters, and it’s why even though they shouldn’t have been friends, they needed each other.</p><p><b>On Melissa and Richard’s friendship:<br/></b><i>MH:</i> Those two loved each other from the day they met in a way that was like, every director’s dream, because they showed up and immediately got along. Richard would show up on days he wasn’t filming and take Melissa to lunch. It was amazing because they were truly becoming friends on this movie and when we got to the scene where they were essentially breaking up, they had to hug each other afterwards because it was so painful.</p><p><b>On working alongside Richard E. Grant:<br/></b><i>MM:</i> He’s so completely present as a person, and that certainly translates into his beautiful acting because he is 1,000% there. If you go this way, he goes with you. There’s just an ease to it. And we do sometimes these incredibly difficult scenes that were just heartbreaking, and then when we finished, we’d both become very silly and throwaway, which is really important sometimes when you’re shooting something that’s difficult. And then we’d go right back to it. I had such an ease working with him. I think we work in a very similar way. I think we fully commit, right or wrong, and trusted that Marielle is at the helm of a ship and she did it with complete authority and a complete lightness at the same time.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On the benefits of having a female director:<br/></b><i>MM:</i> Hands down it was fantastic. And I’ve been very fortunate to work a lot of wonderful male directors [who] also have a quote-unquote ‘feminine side’, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ben-falcone/\">my husband</a>, Paul Feig, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/theodore-melfi/\">Ted Melfi</a>, they all have a capacity to listen and be collaborative. I think with Mari, what always sticks in my head, there was never a moment where you didn’t feel completely guided. And the crew, you could see it, really felt like they were all part of this, we knew exactly what Mari’s vision is. And working in this kind of time frame, you need that cohesiveness, and you need someone—I think it’s more likely to happen with a female director—you need someone to do the right thing for the movie, instead of proving that they’re right. And there’s a big difference there. And when you get someone like Mari doing that, the world just falls into place.</p><p><b>On approaching a dramatic role versus a comedic role:<br/></b><i>MM:</i> There’s absolutely no difference to me. If it’s comedy or drama, it doesn’t change for me at all, I think if it’s a straight comedy, I still try to find, or I’m least very interested in, like, what’s tragic about that person. Like, if they’re so overly pleasant and happy, why? What pain are they hiding? So I do the same thing, if someone’s really aggressive, what’s behind that? So I change nothing. Maybe you’re supposed to, but I don’t.</p>"

Ursula Macfarlane’s film examines the sexual misconduct charges surrounding disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein via gut-wrenching, first-hand testimony from some of his accusers.</p><p> It also chronicles Weinstein’s rise to power in the movie business, and his long tradition of wielding power and access to control the way media reported about him. Following the screening, Macfarlane acknowledged that the story being told in her film isn’t finished yet, with Weinstein yet to stand trial.</p><p> “We had to make a decision,” she explained. “Because you could carry on filming this story for God knows how long it’s gonna take until there’s some kind of conclusion. But we wanted to make our film evergreen in a way. So we did make a decision quite early on that we would begin with the arrest and we would end with the arrest. It almost became a kind of mythological, epic story.”</p><p> “It remains to be seen, of course, as to whether the legal system itself is capable of prosecuting someone like Harvey Weinstein,” added producer Simon Chinn. “Our hope is, through watching [<i>Untouchable</i>] you’ll get a clearer understanding of the nature of abuse in this industry and why the legal system is insufficient in dealing with it, perhaps. But equally, hopefully, you will understand how plausible the women who are accusing him are. For me, the film shows irrefutably that these women are to be believed. Let’s be clear about that.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p> One of Weinstein’s accusers, actor <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/rosanna-arquette/\">Rosanna Arquette</a>, appears in the movie and was present at the screening.  </p><p> “A lot of women are not in this [film] because they were too afraid to speak,” said Arquette after the screening. “And I’ve heard from all of ’em, pretty much, during this process. Today. Everybody’s triggered. I’m here for all of them. I stand in solidarity for them, representing them. Just by telling your story, you help another person tell their story, so it’s a chain reaction across the world. So for that, we all very blessed to be a part of that because it’s helping people heal, slowly but surely.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/untitled-amazing-johnathan-documentary/\">Untitled Amazing Johnathan Documentary</a><br/></b></i>The Amazing Johnathan is a successful Las Vegas-based magician/comedian with a slightly sadistic edge to his act—his most famous gag involves appearing to slice a knife into his own arm.</p><p> Before watching, we weren’t sure that this would be the most inspired topic for a documentary, but the film was not at all what we were expecting. This is one of those documentaries that eventually becomes more about its own making than the ostensible subject matter.</p><p> Not that The Amazing Johnathan isn’t worthy of a doc—he’s a plenty interesting guy in a unique situation and the film gets a lot of value out of examining him. But the film has more to say about the nature of documentary filmmaking itself, as director <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ben-berman/\">Ben Berman</a> becomes more and more central to proceedings.</p><p> There are secrets revealed throughout the film that might make you question its veracity. We won’t spill them here, but following the screening, Berman stood up to attest to its truthfulness.</p><p> “It’s absolutely real shit that happened,” he swore. “The biggest theme of the movie is trying to determine what’s truth versus what’s illusion, right? So to have that experience continue into you guys watching it is very exciting.”</p><p> The film’s comedic sensibility betrays Berman’s previous involvement in oddball comedy shows like <i>Eagleheart</i>, <i>Lady Dynamite </i>and various <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tim-and-eric-awesome-show-great-job-chrimbus-special/\">Tim and Eric</a> projects.</p><p> The Amazing Johnathan himself was also present, and an audience member asked him about his current relationship with Berman, considering that it gets pretty strained in the film. “I don’t know what our relationship’s like,” he replied. “It was only towards the very end that I hated him. He definitely made up for it, what a genius ending.”</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/memory-the-origins-of-alien/\">Memory: The Origins of Alien</a><br/></b></i>Screening as part of the festival’s genre-leaning Midnight section, this documentary about Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alien/\">Alien</a> </i>is the latest work from film nerd extraordinaire Alexandre O. Philippe, the Swiss director behind such documentaries as <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/78-52/\">78/52</a> </i>(2017), which was entirely about the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/psycho/\">Psycho</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-people-vs-george-lucas/\">The People vs. George Lucas</a> </i>(2010), which examined <i>Star Wars </i>fan discontent.</p><p> Philippe’s latest film is a deep scholarly dive into the cultural forces that lead to <i>Alien</i>’s creation. He factors in Greek and Egyptian mythology, underground comic books, sci-fi B-movies and the art of Francis Bacon.</p><p> “For <i>Alien </i>to become an A-movie in 1979, it doesn’t make sense,” Philippe said following the screening. “This is not a time when people were ready for it. And what becomes really interesting is this idea of, when a movie becomes that successful, at a time when the environment is not quite ready for it, what does it mean? It means, in a way, that there were certain images and certain ideas, and that we as a collective unconscious, and I truly believe this, that we summoned this film, we collectively put it on the screen.”</p><p>Philippe’s film champions the contributions of screenwriter <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/dan-obannon/\">Dan O’Bannon</a>, who is often overlooked in favor of Scott and HR Giger, the Swiss artist behind the film’s iconic creature design. O’Bannon’s first attempt at the screenplay that would eventually become <i>Alien </i>was named ‘Memory’, hence the documentary’s title.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p> “To me, this film really is about the triptych of O’Bannon, Giger and Scott, and the symbiosis between those three people. It’s essentially an essay about those three extraordinary people meeting.”</p><p> The film was originally just going to be about the film’s most notorious scene before Philippe expanded his scope: “I was very intrigued with this idea of the chest-burster scene and, especially after <i>78/52</i>, of making another film about another scene that had an impact on us as a culture. It seemed like a natural fit. But we did an early sizzle [reel], and it didn’t feel right.”</p><p> The resulting documentary is strong argument for the value of a film that does nothing but critically examine another film.</p><p> “What I really hope is that this film will make people look at <i>Alien </i>and consider it in a different light and maybe wanna go and dig deeper into it. Great movies, you can go over and over and over again and you will never ever get to the bottom, you will always see something new.”</p>"

While <i>The Lodge </i>is wonderfully creepy on multiple levels, what really sets it apart is its artful composure and excruciating tension, making it a work that goes far beyond Franz and Fiala’s impressive debut.</p><p>Following the Sundance press screening, Letterboxd asked Franz and Fiala if there were any lessons they learned about subverting audience expectations from the twisty <i>Goodnight Mommy </i>that they may have applied to this film.</p><p>“We try not to overthink it in a way,” responded Fiala. “It’s not all that planned. I think we always try to make a film that we ourselves would like to see, and we try to take it seriously. But it’s not that we think: okay, we did this before, this time the audience is gonna expect this or that or something like that. I think we always try to stay true to the material and the characters.”</p><p>“And there are similarities to our first one,” Fiala continued. “I think mainly because it’s the things that interest us in life. It was not like a conscious decision: it worked the first time so we’re gonna do it like that this time. It was just like, we’re still interested in those questions of family and trauma and bondage in a way. Emotional bonds. Trust that’s been shaken, I think that’s something that really interests us.”</p><p>“This time it’s also about religion, in a way, which we didn’t do last time,” added Franz. “The script, it was offered to us by Hammer Films, it was originally written by a Scottish screenwriter [Sergio Casci], and so we kind of re-wrote it in a way, because the ending didn’t work. For us.”</p><p>That’s right, <i>The Lodge</i> was produced by Hammer, the legendary British horror production outfit best known for churning out Dracula and Frankenstein films starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in the 1960s and 70s. The brand was resurrected a decade or so back and has released about half a dozen films since then, including <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/let-me-in/\">Let Me In</a> </i>(2010), <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wake-wood/\">Wake Wood</a></i> (2011) and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-woman-in-black-2012/\">The Woman In Black</a></i> (2012). With <i>The Lodge</i>, a British-produced film directed by two Austrians, shot in Canada and set in the United States, Hammer may just have its first modern classic on its hands.</p><p>Franz went on to emphasize the importance of the shooting location in telling their story. “For us, the house, architecture, it’s like a character. And as it was our first English-speaking film, you know, it’s a lodge, it’s three persons or four actors and it’s something you can handle in a way, or you hope you can at least.”</p><p>Some of the creepiest parts of the film are Grace’s flashbacks to her life in the aforementioned doomsday cult, the leader of which was her father. To make it even weirder, that cult leader is played by Riley Keough’s actual father, musician Danny Keough, in his first feature film role.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>“We were desperately looking for a cult priest, and couldn’t find someone who would be perfect for the part,” explained Franz. “We were already shooting and in one of the breaks, Riley FaceTimed Danny and she wanted to introduce us. She turned the mobile [phone] around and said, ‘Look, this is my father,’ and Severin and I were like, ‘Oh, he’s the cult priest!’.”</p><p>Keough Sr was also present at the post-screening Q&amp;A, and was asked what he drew upon in playing a cult leader.</p><p>“Um, I grew up in a cult,” was Keough’s response. “So I had eight years of study. We had a really wicked guy that… yeah, so… when they asked me to do it I thought ‘How do I do this? Do I go over the top? Do I do a just crazy psychotic thing?’ But that’s never the case, it’s always a Jesus-like syndrome, I don’t know what you’d call that. Underneath is a real hatred. So what I tried to do during that role was just play this real sweet guy, but if you look closely enough, you can see that he really just wants to kill you.”</p><p>Indie specialist distributor Neon (<i>Colossal</i>, <i>Gemini</i>, <i>I, Tonya</i>) acquired <i>The Lodge </i>at Sundance and will release it theatrically later this year. </p>"

      "body": "<p><b>Park City, Utah:</b> One of the most buzzed-about films at this year’s <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival\">Sundance Film Festival</a> is <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/honey-boy/\">Honey Boy</a></i>, an autobiographical drama written by and starring Shia LaBeouf and directed by Israeli filmmaker Alma Har’el. The film is her narrative debut following several documentaries, including <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bombay-beach/\">Bombay Beach</a></i>, which won the Jury prize at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival.<br/></p><p>Inspired by LaBeouf’s relationship with his alcoholic father, <i>Honey Boy</i> chronicles two periods in the life of an actor named Otis, played as a boy by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/noah-jupe/\">Noah Jupe</a> (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-quiet-place-2018/\">A Quiet Place</a></i>) and as a young man by Lucas Hedges, beloved by Letterboxd fans for his work in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/manchester-by-the-sea/\">Manchester by the Sea</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-bird/\">Lady Bird</a> </i>and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/lucas-hedges/\">so many more</a>.</p><p>LaBeouf portrays Otis’s father James, an emotionally and physically abusive former rodeo clown who works for Otis as an on-set chaperone. Struggling with his own demons and resentful of his son’s burgeoning success, James heaps more upon poor young Otis than any child should have to endure.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>Later in the story, Otis meets a counselor (played by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/laura-san-giacomo/\">Laura San Giacamo</a>) who instructs him to write about the experiences that led him to this place.</p><p>An intimate depiction of an abusive father/son relationship, <i>Honey Boy </i>is a startlingly honest film featuring a raft of powerful performances. LaBeouf is a revelation playing a character based on his own father, and Jupe once again shows that he’s one of the best child actors in the business. And although he stops short of an impression, it’s clear that Hedges is channelling some of LaBeouf’s unmistakable mannerisms. There’s also strong supporting work from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/fka-twigs/\">FKA Twigs</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/clifton-collins-jr/\">Clifton Collins Jr</a>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>Ahead of the film’s world premiere at Sundance, Letterboxd spoke with Har’el, who said that although she is trying to say something with the film, she wants it to be open to interpretation.</p><p>“It wouldn’t be a film if it wasn’t. It would be propaganda,” Har’el told us. “I want people to take away whatever they want to take away from it, as long as they come and see it. There’s a lot to take away from it for different people.</p><p> “The film is about obviously a real story, so it really lives in the world between a real story and a film that also captures something that only maybe you could see outside of the experience. It’s in that line that we walk that I think the film lives.”</p><p>We asked Har’el if she thought making the film was a cathartic experience for LaBeouf, who really puts it all out there.</p><p> “I got a sense that every person that was involved in this film, including Shia, and everybody that will watch this film, is gonna experience catharsis.”</p><p> Following the premiere, Har’el and her cast got on stage for a Q&amp;A, where a visibly emotional LaBeouf opened up about the experience of exploring his own trauma as a part of his rehabilitation.</p><p> “It’s strange to like, fetishize your pain and make a product out of it,” he said. “And you feel guilty about that, because it felt very selfish. This whole thing felt very selfish. I never went into this thinking ‘Let me fucking help people’. It wasn’t my goal, I was falling apart.”</p><p> The film can’t help but raise questions about LaBeouf’s current relationship with his father, and an audience member vocalized this query.</p><p> “Previous to this, me and my father hadn’t spoken for six or seven years,” the actor let on. “We’re talking now, I talked to him before I came in here.”</p><p> Har’el also touched upon how her work as a documentary filmmaker informed <i>Honey Boy</i>.</p><p> “When you make a documentary, you really go through a lot with people because they’re not actors and as they make it they realize what they’re going through and that they’re about to expose themselves in a certain way that might change their lives. I think Shia’s going through something very similar.”</p>"

(Hot damn, those push notifications are gonna come in handy!)</p><p>Finally, as our<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/2018/\"> <b>2018 Year in Review</b></a> disappears in the rear-view mirror, a few highlights as noted by the Letterboxd team:<br/> </p><ul><li>The mix of films in the overall <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/2018-highest-rated-films/\">Top 50 Highest Rated</a> is a useful snapshot of where filmmaking is at in 2018: from the variety of genres to the slowly growing number of non-white protagonists, to the 11 women-directed films (up from last year’s three—and a much better statistic than this year’s zero female director Oscar nominees). It seems Hollywood is incrementally starting to resemble the rest of the world. We point this out because, as the Letterboxd community writes, time and again in your reviews, we are suckers for representation—and frankly, it doesn’t seem to affect box office negatively.</li><li>On that note, the non-English languages represented hard in the top films of 2018: <i>Roma’s</i> characters speaking in Spanish and Mixtec, <i>Shoplifters</i> in Japanese, and the people of Wakanda in isiXhosa, not to mention the non-verbal language of “Spidey-sense”.</li><li>2018 was a huge year for studios and superheroes: from the celebration of Black Joy and the afrofuturist art of <i>Black Panther</i> to the absolute explosion of the comic book style in <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i>. Letterboxd member reviews suggest what’s working is the attention to storytelling within the blockbuster form, whether it’s the brilliant reimagining of what makes a ‘bad guy’ tick in <i>Black Panther </i>or the subtle examination of the Brooklyn middle school system in <i>Spider-Verse</i>.</li><li>Some things never change: Scarlett Johansson was our most watched actress again (with the great Danai Gurira—<i>Black Panther</i>’s Okoye—close behind), and Samuel L. Jackson was our most watched actor, again.</li></ul><p>This last fact made us curious about 2019 for Johansson and Jackson. Looking at Jackson’s slate, which has already kicked off with M. Night Shyamalan’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/glass-2019/\"><i>Glass</i></a>, he is undoubtedly on the fast-track to most watched again. He’ll be back as Nick Fury in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/captain-marvel/\"><i>Captain Marvel</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/spider-man-far-from-home/\"><i>Spider-Man: Far from Home</i></a>, and he stars as John Shaft II in the new <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/shaft-2019/\">Shaft</a> </i>sequel/reboot, sandwiched between Richard Roundtree’s John Shaft and Jesse T. Usher’s John Shaft Jr. Then there’s Todd Robinson’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-last-full-measure/\"><i>The Last Full Measure</i></a>, and <i>The Banker,</i> a drama about 1950s entrepreneur Joe Morris, one of the first African American real estate scions.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson, meanwhile, is keeping 2019 slightly more chill with just three anticipated releases while she preps her Black Widow feature film: Taika Waititi’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/jojo-rabbit/\">Jojo Rabbit</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/avengers-endgame/\">Avengers: Endgame</a></i>, and an untitled Noah Baumbach project. </p><p>Onward, film lovers!</p><!--figure[1]-->"

As we’ve noted in the past, there is room for so much improvement in the industry as far as representation goes, but this sure is an encouraging indicator, as is the higher number of directors of color.</p><p>Digging deeper, we found 22 women writers attached to 17 of the 50 highest rated films. And 19 of the films had interesting female leads—not including films with diverse ensemble casts. Countries represented in the top 50, aside from the US and UK: Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Poland, India, Italy, Taiwan, France, Brazil, Lebanon, Spain, China, Argentina, Denmark, Germany, Darkest Peru and Wakanda.

He wrote many of the beloved songs from the <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moana-2016/\">Moana</a></i> soundtrack, and you can check out his five favorite movie musicals <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/lin-manuel-mirandas-favorite-movie-musicals/\">here</a>.</p><p>In <i>Mary Poppins Returns</i>, Miranda plays a cockney lamplighter named Jack, revealed to be an apprentice of Bert, Dick Van Dyke’s character from the first film. Well, one of them. In one of many winsome musical numbers, Miranda performs in the the rap-meets-Broadway style he popularized with <i>Hamilton</i>. Rapping. In a Disney movie. Try not to faint.</p><p>All the songs are pretty fantastic. They were written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, whose most famous collaboration was the hit Broadway musical <i>Hairspray</i>. Richard B. Sherman, the surviving half of iconic songwriting team the Sherman Brothers (who wrote the songs for <i>Mary Poppins</i>, among other iconic films), is a musical consultant on the film.</p><p>The result? <i>Mary Poppins Returns</i> won’t be destined for The Place Where Lost Things Go.</p><p>A man has dreams, and Letterboxd’s Dominic Corry had one of his come true when he got in a room in Beverly Hills with Blunt, Miranda and Marshall (and some other press) to discuss the film.</p><p><b>On the pressure of following up such a beloved movie:<br/></b><i>Rob Marshall:</i> I thought to myself when this came my way, “if anybody is gonna do it, I would like to do it”. It was incredibly daunting at first of course, but I wanted to be able to, in an odd way, protect the first film and treat this film with great care and love. Musicals are very difficult to do, an original musical, there are so many layers to it, but with this one, creating an original musical from scratch was actually for me a dream, and I’ve never done it before and to be able to create it with this beautiful company was exactly what I was hoping for. The guiding message of this film about finding light in the darkness is honestly what drew me to it and kept guiding me throughout the whole process including until this very moment, when people are actually now seeing the film. And I’m just speaking for myself, but I feel people need this film now. I knew that I wanted to live in that world and be part of sending that message out into the world now of looking for hope and light in a dark time.</p><p><b>On how Emily Blunt came to the role:<br/></b><i>Emily Blunt: </i>I got a voicemail from Rob, who is my dear friend and we have known each other a long time, and the voice mail certainly had a sort of charged energy to it. I was like, “Oh my God, what is it? What is this project?” And when he called me, he said, “We’ve been digging through the Disney archives and by far their most prized possession.” And I was like “What, <i>what is that?</i>” And when he said <i>Mary Poppins, </i>I thought the air changed in the room. </p><p>It was so extraordinary, such an extraordinary, rather unparalleled moment for me because I was filled with an instantaneous “yes”, but also with some trepidation, all happening simultaneously in that moment because she is so iconic. She had such a big imprint on my life and on everyone’s lives, you know? People hold this character so close to their hearts. And so how do I create my version of her? What will my version of her be? No one wants to see me do a sort of cheap impersonation of Julie Andrews because no one is Julie Andrews. And so she should be preserved and treasured in her own way for what she did. I knew this was going to be something that I wanted to take a big swing with and I knew I could do it with this man who is the most emboldening, meticulous, brilliant director in the world and I was in safe hands with him. However much I knew I had my work cut out for me.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On how Blunt sought to differentiate her Mary Poppins from Julie Andrews’ take on the character in the 1964 film:<br/></b><i>EB: </i>What I decided to do, even though I’d seen it as a child, was not watch the original so close to shooting our version, I think probably because she is so beautiful and so extraordinary, I would have maybe tried to accommodate in some way, and let that sort of bleed into what I wanted to do. So I just decided to go on my gut instinct from the book because she is rather different in all of the books [by P.L. Travers].</p><p>If I’m going to carve out new space for myself, it was gonna have to be without watching the details of what Julie did so close to shooting. I have this searing memory of <i>Mary Poppins</i>, but not of all of the tiny details of how she played the character. And so as soon as we wrapped I watched the original. I was just floored by it, and probably relieved that I hadn’t watched it because I was all, “My god, she’s amazing!”.</p><p><b>On how Lin-Manuel Miranda came to be involved in the project:<br/></b><i>Lin-Manuel Miranda: </i>I remember going to the midnight premiere screening of <i>Chicago </i>at the Ziegfeld Theater [in New York], and seeing the greatest modern movie musical I’d ever seen in my life. So when I got a call from Rob Marshall, and [choreographer] John DeLuca saying, “We’d like to talk to you about something,” that became an immediate priority.</p><p>They came to buy me a drink between shows. I was still in <i>Hamilton </i>at the time and I had a two-show day. So I finished the matinee, rolled across the street to the Paramount Hotel and I met them for a drink and they said, “Sequel to <i>Mary Poppins,</i>” and I said, “Who’s playing Mary Poppins?” And they said, “Emily Blunt,” and I said “Oh, that’s good”.</p><p>I can’t give them enough credit for seeing this role in me because there is no childlike wonder in Alexander Hamilton. He has a very traumatic early life. He goes on that stage and he wants to devour the world and he wants to move so fast and he wants to do everything, whereas Jack in this movie, as they pitched him to me, has this childlike sense of wonder. He’s in touch with that imagination you all see in your kids when they can sort of play in their own imagination for hours. Jack never lost that and that was I feel so humbled that [Rob] saw that in me. From that moment, from that drink, I was in. It came along at the perfect time for my family too, you know. We had finished a year of performing <i>Hamilton </i>and then I chopped my hair off and left the country and jumped into Mary Poppins’ universe. It was like, beautiful.<br/><b><br/>On rapping in a Disney movie:<br/></b><i>LM: </i>I would urge you to re-watch the first film. Because everyone who is like, “Wow, there’s rapping in <i>Mary Poppins Returns,” </i>forgets that Bert has a 30-second rap about all the women he dated before Mary Poppins. You’ve forgotten it, but <i>Jolly Holiday </i>is one big flirt between Mary and Bert.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On balancing reverence with innovation:<br/></b><i>RM:</i> I really felt that everyone who was a part of this needed to have the first film in their blood in some way because that’s what we were following. I use myself as a barometer because I thought well, what would I want to see? If I came to a sequel to <i>Mary Poppins </i>I would want to see an animation sequence with live action and I would want it to be hand drawn in a 2D world. I would want Cherry Tree Lane to have a curve to it because that’s the Cherry Tree Lane we all know. It was as simple as that, although we were finding our new way. There were sort of goal posts or sign posts throughout that we needed to hold on to because it’s in the DNA of the material.</p><p>I knew there needed to be a big huge production number with athletic dancers with Mary and Jack, Jack leading the entire piece. That needed to be in there in some way. I would feel that if it wasn’t there we’ve gone off track. It was this insane balancing act of honoring the first film, but at the same time forging our own way. Marc and Scott were incredibly careful about making sure that we didn’t abuse using [musical] themes from the first film. It’s so easy to use. We used it in very strategic places throughout the film. Most of it actually very much at the end where we feel we’d earned it by then. And that’s what Marc was very careful about doing. I did feel that we were coming from the right place and that was the key.</p>"

Happy to, read on.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>1. Feature-length<br/></b>All films had to be feature length; which meant highly-rated TV specials and short films were out. (For the record, your five highest rated Christmas shorts/featurettes are: <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-charlie-brown-christmas/\">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas/\">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-snowman/\">The Snowman</a>,  <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/emmet-otters-jug-band-christmas/\">Emmet Otter’s Jug Band Christmas</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mickeys-christmas-carol/\">Mickey’s Christmas Carol</a></i>.)</p><p><b>2. Released at Christmas<br/></b>Allowing for a few exceptions due to mid-century film release practices (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/miracle-on-34th-street/\">Miracle on 34th Street</a></i> was first released in June of 1947), we limited our selection to films released in the window around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Strange as it may seem now, <i>Die Hard</i> and <i>Gremlins</i> functioned primarily as US summer blockbusters that happened to be set at Christmas.</p><p><b>3. ‘Christmassy’ or merely set at Christmas?<br/></b>Is there just a sprinkling of Christmas, Shane Black-style? Or are the main characters’ actions significantly affected by the specific time of year? Does the film explore deeper moral questions inspired by the “reason for the season” à la <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/its-a-wonderful-life/\">It’s a Wonderful Life</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tokyo-godfathers/\">Tokyo Godfathers</a></i>? Does it <i>feel </i>festive?</p><p>Just because a film is called <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/christmas-2009/\">Navidad</a></i> doesn’t mean it’s really about Christmas—sorry Sebastián Lelio. Could the events in the film happen at any other point in the year without significantly affecting the overall experience? Sure, there’s some extra emotional heft to John McClane’s predicament, but honestly? That work party could have taken place in July (and we will gladly receive all your reckons about <i>Die Hard</i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/is-die-hard-a-christmas-movie/\">over here</a>).</p><p>So where does that leave <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/carol-2015/\">Carol</a></i>, you ask…</p><p><b>4. Watched—and re-watched—at Christmas<br/></b>Our ultimate filter. “A Christmas movie is like a Christmas song—you don’t want to listen to it except at Christmas,” argued Letterboxd co-founder Karl in the midst of our discussions. Using this theory, we took our master list and applied a new filter: how often are these films also watched at other times in the year? Or do they tend to be December-only appointments? </p><p>After running some numbers, a few more highly rated, still-somewhat-Christmassy films dropped off the list. Goodbye, <i>The Apartment</i>. Forget <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/loureviews/film/remember-the-night/\"><i>Remember the Night</i></a>. So long, <i>Carol</i> (even though your name is literally Carol). We’re not saying these are <i>not </i>films you watch at Christmas, but that based on the data, you love these films <i>every</i> month of the year, not <i>only</i> in December. Therefore, we classify them as perennial favorites, rather than Christmas indulgences.<br/></p><p><b>The Top 25<br/></b>What remains is, we think, a very merry Letterboxd-y list. You have your vintage holiday classics like <i>It’s a Wonderful Life, Meet Me in St Louis </i>and <i>White Christmas</i>. A problematic fave or two (looking at you, <i>Holiday Inn</i>). More recent family comedies like <i>Home Alone </i>and <i>Elf</i>. Also: Japanese anime, British animation, a French classic, a Finnish horror-fantasy, and a brand new zombie musical. And four adaptations of Charles Dickens’ classic <i>A Christmas Carol </i>(look out, here are 400 versions in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF_rKE3nIoI\">a single video</a>).</p><p>One thing we observed: that “highest rated” in a Christmas sense means these films carry a modest average rating of three stars or more (with only <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i> earning an average above four), whereas all 25 films in our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/25-highest-rated-horrors-of-all-time-2018/\">horror list</a> are firmly in the four-and-above stratosphere. That’s a comment on the quality of Christmas-themed films, perhaps. (And an opportunity for screenwriters out there.) </p><p>So here you have it: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/25-highest-rated-christmas-films-of-all-time/\">the 25 highest rated Christmas films of all time</a>, as at December 2018, according to you, the Letterboxd community. No fighting, it’s Christmas!

This is the one I’ve seen the most as it’s become a semi-regular Christmas tradition. Beyond the animation (which is just incredible) the thing that shines most is Kon’s humanism. Each of the three main characters is complex, sympathetic and very real.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/delthorpe/film/tokyo-godfathers/\">Delthorpe</a></p></blockquote><!--figure[3]--><p><b>3. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-nightmare-before-christmas/\">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></i> </b>(1993, US)<br/><i>Directed by Henry Selick</i></p><blockquote><p>“A Halloween/Christmas classic that still stands as one of the best examples of stop motion. The design of the film is amazing and just drenched in atmosphere and the music is just as fantastic. It may not have the grandness and complexity of stop motions that have come after it, but this is still an absolute joy to watch.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/arminr/film/the-nightmare-before-christmas/\">Armin</a></p></blockquote><!--figure[4]--><p><b>4. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/scrooge-1951/\">Scrooge</a></i> </b>(1951, UK)<br/><i>Directed by Brian Desmond Hurst</i></p><blockquote><p>“<i>A Christmas Carol</i> is a treasure of spirit and good will with which any holiday season is incomplete. Alastair Sim plays Scrooge so magnificently his performance has become the standard by which all other Scrooges are compared. It’s hard to believe now that the film had such a slow start, such an uneven and unheralded journey on its way to becoming a classic. But it did become a classic and for that we can be thankful, forever and without condition. Bonus items: Animated Victorian Puppets.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/carbubble/film/scrooge-1951/\">Thomas</a><br/></p></blockquote><!--figure[5]--><p><b>5. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/meet-me-in-st-louis/\">Meet Me in St. Louis</a></i> </b>(1944, US)<br/><i>Directed by Vincente Minnelli</i></p><blockquote><p> “Think I’ll make this film a new annual tradition I loved it so much. Judy Garland is, frankly, magnificent—and I adored her gutsy, knows-who-she-is-and-what-she-wants character.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dannyjp/film/meet-me-in-st-louis/\">Danny</a><br/></p></blockquote><!--figure[6]--><p><b>6. </b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/black-christmas/\"><b>Black Christmas</b></a> </i>(1974, Canada)<br/><i>Directed by Bob Clark</i></p><blockquote><p>“It’d been so long since I’d seen this it was almost like watching it for the first time and wow, this is how you make a slasher movie. Everything works so well; the story, the characters, the Christmas setting. But what I enjoyed most is the dark, depressing and moody tone… it is so befitting of the holidays.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/horrorfan/film/black-christmas/\">Horrorfan</a><br/></p></blockquote><!--figure[7]--><p><b>7. </b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-muppet-christmas-carol/\"><b>The Muppet Christmas Carol</b></a></i> (1992, US)<br/><i>Directed by Brian Henson</i></p><blockquote><p>“Obviously what separates this film apart from other adaptations is the crossover with the Muppets. I never really grew up with them, but this film won me over almost instantly. Being a Jim Henson production the world was full of imagination.

Here’s some of what she had to say:</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>On what drew her to the role:<br/></b><i>Natalie Portman:</i><b> </b>It was an incredible opportunity to play a character that I’d never had the chance to play before. And also to work with someone like Brady who I think is incredibly talented and interesting and full of great ideas. And then also, I think a lot of the themes are really relevant to the world we live in. It feels like a really accurate portrayal of what it’s like to live in this moment in history, which feels very specific in a way that I hadn’t seen reflected before.</p><p><b>On how she approached the character:<br/></b>The biggest part of the character was the writing. Brady wrote such a specific character that felt so rounded and just like a real human being. Sometimes she’s really authentic and sometimes she’s totally fake. Sometimes she’s cruel and sometimes she’s gentle. And sometimes she’s performing and sometimes she’s being. It was really just remarkable reading it. So I feel like that really provided a great blueprint.</p><p><b>On whether or not she discussed how to approach Celeste with Raffey Cassidy, who plays the younger Celeste:<br/></b>We actually didn’t and I think that was intentional for Brady because he really wanted them to be different characters. Because she’s really changed obviously from this innocent young woman at the beginning and then we catch her after twenty years of hard life and I loved the fact that he chose to skip that period because we all know how to fill it in, we know plenty of, you know, the hard times of a pop star, the rocky road until their resurrection, it’s such a familiar tale to us so we don’t have to see it.</p><p><b>On working alongside Cassidy, who also plays her daughter, Albertine:<br/></b>Raffey’s remarkable. We didn’t rehearse together, we just started working together. The first time I saw her as young Celeste was when I saw the finished film, so to see how she could modify her performance so subtly [as Albertine] and really be believable as two completely different characters. I really thought Brady was nuts, I was like, “Are you sure? You’re gonna make me stand next to the actor that played me in the beginning and try to make people believe that we’re the same character?” But Brady was really convinced about it, and I think it’s so powerful in the film. I think we still often see our kids as versions of ourselves, and how we relate to them with all the self-hatred and self-love, alternately, or sometimes all at once. And then I think it’s just so powerful to have it embodied, the entire time she’s with her daughter, she’s also with her younger self. Both as what that means for everyone experiencing parenthood, but also for the film to see both of these versions of this woman together. I think it works because it’s like a metaphor but it also works literally. She does such a great job of acting. You do always believe that both characters are different people, but she holds within her both characters, so there’s like a doubling of meaning all the time.</p><p><b>On working with Jude Law again:<br/></b>Jude is just one of the greatest actors. His voice in this is different than I’ve ever heard. It has such amazing resonance. He is again also one of the kindest most wonderful people I know, a real major talent. It was very lucky ’cause this is the fourth film I’ve been in with him. We worked together for the first time on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/cold-mountain/\"><i>Cold Mountain</i></a> almost twenty years ago, and then <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/closer/\"><i>Closer</i></a>, and we both were in the Wong Kar-Wai film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/my-blueberry-nights/\"><i>My Blueberry Nights</i></a>, [but] we didn’t have scenes together. So I’ve known him over the course of like, twenty years. We’ve never been like buddies or hanging out or anything, but I’ve worked with him and so it was lucky going into this that we had a history and comfort level to play off of, so like day one, I already felt at ease.</p><p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>On performing songs written by Sia:<br/></b>It was incredible when I received the script to have the Sia songs with it, I remember getting an email with these attachments of the songs, and she sings them herself on the demos so of course\nthey’re just gorgeous. Beautiful, beautiful songs, really great pop songs so I knew that it was realistic, because if you read a script and it says “and then she writes a hit pop song” and you don’t see the song, you’re like: okay good luck getting that. But it was clear from the beginning that it had this incredible music. And then getting to record it was really fun, because I got to work with [longtime Sia collaborator] Chris [Briade] who’s incredible and just the loveliest person. To see what they can do, they’re the real artists, they can do so much magic to make things sound like what we’re used to hearing.</p></p><p><b>On how she prepped for the lengthy song and dance performance finalé:<br/></b>Physically it was a lot of preparation, I worked with [movement coach] Raquel [Horsford], I worked with my husband on the choreography, across like a month. I actually prepped the film twice, because the night before, I think I was on my way to the airport, the first time, and they were like, “Turn home, the financing has come apart”. The movie was cancelled and I had prepped everything. When everything got pulled back together again it was a few months later, even though of course it was relatively recent in my memory, I had to kind of start over. So that was kind of nice because it gave me a longer time to prep, and a longer time to sit in my head and my body and all that.</p><p>So physically, it was dance training, physical training to have this endurance, and then emotionally I kept asking Brady if I should be kind of ‘off’. She’s had this massive breakdown, she’s had this drug experience, and he was like, “No, she’s out of it but she’s a professional, and she’s done this a million times…”.</p><p>She can handle it to the point where the audience isn’t aware that she had a drug-fuelled meltdown minutes earlier. So that was really informative in terms of the headspace, that she can kind of enter a space and leave everything behind her. Which is an interesting key to the character too because there’s a certain kind of erasure that I think must have to happen.</p>"

We wonder how he feels about the slow-burning reaction to the film?</p><p>“I’m doing a lot of press for <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i> right now and going to a lot of screenings, and the common refrain is ‘<i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i>’s great but, man, <i>A Ghost Story</i> is something else!” And I’ve become aware that that might be the movie that defines me more than any other and that’s fine because it’s the movie I’m the most proud of. I certainly know that it has struck a chord.”</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>Letterboxd: In your Big Screen Symposium keynote, you talked about how <i>A Ghost Story</i> came out of a sort of existential crisis in which you realized you might not become the world’s greatest filmmaker, or the best, so you were questioning why you made films at all. <i>A Ghost Story </i>came from wanting to make a small film about what a life means. An act of anti-legacy, if you will. But the film has become accidentally beloved, which means that, in fact, you’ve possibly created a legacy after all.</b></p><p>David Lowery: What a fascinating paradox. I mean the only thing I can say about that is that there’s no way to plan that. There’s no way for me to set out to make a film that will work the way <i>A Ghost Story</i> worked and it would be foolish to try to do so.</p><p>All I can do is make the movies the best that I can. I know that <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i> will be beloved by certain people but it won’t have the effect that <i>A Ghost Story</i> did. But I wouldn’t have known that two years ago. I wouldn’t have known that these two films would both function in such different ways. I would have probably assumed <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun </i>would be the more important one because of Robert Redford being in it. But <i>A Ghost Story </i>was the more important one for me to make, that’s certainly true, and maybe there’s something to be found in the fact that when you feel so compelled to do something it is because the subject matter at hand is more universal than you might understand in the moment.</p><p><b><i>A Ghost Story</i> is a strange film, in that it washes over you, as opposed to something like <i>Pete’s Dragon</i> which is very much a dive-in fantasy-adventure.</b></p><p>I like to think of my movies as bodies of water, that’s a great metaphor for them. And I really like my movies to be lakes that just sort of ripple outward and sometimes they need to be diverted into streams or rivers or freeze in the glaciers.</p><p><i>Pete’s Dragon</i> certainly is the most propulsive body of water that I have constructed so far in that the story moves along at a certain clip—and it needs to because it’s a certain type of movie. But <i>A Ghost Story</i> is a small pond that a rock got thrown into and that’s a type of experience that I really value when I go to the cinema.</p><p>It’s a very, like, wishy-washy metaphor but it really works for me, I really think about the way my movies move in terms of a natural flow and very often those flows calm down to just pure stasis and there’s great beauty in that.</p><p><b>You also made some really specific artistic decisions in the film. Was it shot in 4:3? [Lowery shakes his head firmly.] No?</b></p><p>It’s basically technically 1.33:1 but there’s a millimeter of difference between that and 4:3.</p><p><b>So how do those technical artistic decisions link in with the storytelling?</b></p><p>They were very intrinsic. I think the very first line, let me see. If I open up the script for <i>A Ghost Story</i>… [Lowery fires up his laptop.] I’ve been telling people this but I don’t actually know if it’s true or not… [Opens a draft of the script.] Yeah, so the first line of script says the whole movie will be shot and projected in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. And that’s been there from the very beginning. So those things are very conscientious. Or, if I go down here, like, let’s see, yeah, like I’m getting very specific about “camera pans left”. “We hold for a long time.” I think there was a draft where I actually wrote that we hold for an entire minute. I get very technical.</p><p><b>Well then, we need to talk about pie.</b></p><p>Yes.</p><p><b>Four minutes of pie. What does it say in the script about that? Does it say “Rooney Mara eats pie for four minutes”?</b></p><p>I mean it’s pretty specific [reading aloud]: “She walks past the ghost, she enters all in black, she goes to the sink, sees a pour-over filter, takes out the coffee grounds, throws them out, turns on the sink, rinses out the ceramic filter, lets the sink run for too long. Then she grabs a fork and knife and returns to the table, cuts a piece of pie and hungrily eats it down and then she eats the rest of the pie straight out of the dish.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>When you’re getting that specific in your writing, what’s going on in your head? Are you seeing it?</b></p><p>Definitely I am seeing a version of it, I mean if you look at what’s written there it describes her sitting down at the table. But when we got it together to shoot the scene, Rooney wanted to sit on the floor and that made perfect sense, emotionally speaking, and so we refocused the scene to that, but even when she was sitting at the table, still the language and the grammar was going to be the same.</p><p><b>What is the process of developing the scene once you have your actors attached? Because once an actor is on board, they bring their own sense of their character to a scene. Once they read the script—no matter when filming starts—the work begins, doesn’t it?</b></p><p>It really does, it really does. I mean, <i>A Ghost Story</i> was so fast that there wasn’t much time between Rooney reading the script and her showing up to shoot that scene, like, it was very quick. A couple of weeks, I think.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>Why so fast?</b></p><p>I just didn’t want to wait to make the movie. I mean we had one week of prep for the whole film. We planned it around <i>Pete’s Dragon</i> so I knew that<i> Pete’s Dragon </i>would finish on June 10th and I think on June 17th we started shooting <i>A Ghost Story</i>. And here and there on weekends I would fly to Texas to look for the house and then <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/production-design/jade-healy/\">Jade</a>, my production designer, got there a little ahead of time to start fixing the house up because it was in a state of disarray. But certainly there was not that much time to think things through. We didn’t really have a plan in place. We didn’t even have an assistant director until a day before we started shooting. It really came together very quickly.</p><p><b>In a way that’s even more extraordinary in terms of the way that that film is still growing and finding its audience.</b></p><p>I mean it was interesting looking at that page in the script [the pie scene] and seeing how thoroughly descriptive it was—and if you look at the whole screenplay the movie is very close to it. But at the same time we were just fumbling in the dark every single day and trying things out and just really looking to figure out how to make it, how to cut to the core of what we felt we were after. And we could never put a name on that. We never knew exactly what we were after, but we were collectively working towards it.</p><p><i><b>Intermission: here’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/david-lowerys-five-favorite-ghost-stories/\">a Letterboxd list</a> of David Lowery’s five favorite ghost films.</b></i></p><p><b>During your Big Screen Symposium keynote, you took time to talk through the first scenes of your new film, <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i>, and the long process of finding a strong opening, in which the relationship between Forrest (Robert Redford) and Jewel (Sissy Spacek) is established. You took a lot of inspiration for this from <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/great-scene-thief-da9ae1f3e286\">the diner scene in Michael Mann’s <i>Thief</i></a>.</b></p><p><b>When you have more preparation time with your actors, how does that affect the script’s development? What is the process between the draft you send them and the final version that gets filmed?</b></p><p>For example that scene in the diner that we talked about yesterday at the panel, that seemed to not change. That was, I wrote it and that’s what we shot, and [Redford and Spacek] illuminated it but they worked with that material.</p><p>But then there are other scenes that they had a lot of input on and Sissy, I give her all the credit for a jewelry store scene in the movie that she latched onto early on. It was a very short scene in the script and she saw a way in which to expand it that she felt was necessary for the character. It was 100% right, she was 100% right about that and it’s one of my favorite scenes in the movie—but it wouldn’t even have been in the movie had it not been for her.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>Presumably A-list actors are often looking for ways to expand their scenes, but for female actors, who continue to be under-represented in strong roles on screen, it’s even more important?</b></p><p>Definitely, definitely, definitely. That’s an interesting perspective. I hadn’t thought about it from that perspective. Because I always feel like I’m asking the actors to do too much, like, “that big scene? Let’s get rid of that so you can take a break tomorrow.” I mean, I never do that, but in my mind I always feel like I need to remove scenes so they don’t have to work so hard. I always want to give them a break because they’re doing so much.</p><p>But certainly, especially a movie called <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun </i>that’s about <i>men</i>, it was great to find any opportunity in that film to give precedence to the female characters. And so I’m so thankful that Sissy took that opportunity. She has great scenes in the movie. She’s in quite a bit of the film but she really used that scene to define who her character was for her. And then because it worked for her it works for the audience as well and for me.</p><p><!--figure[6]--></p><p><b>You also talked a bit about making sure that not everybody on your set looks like you. Would you elaborate on that?</b></p><p>I mean it’s certainly something I took for granted for a long time, it just wasn’t something I thought about and I certainly wasn’t working entirely with men. I’ve been surrounded by wonderful female collaborators since day one, but I think everyone in the industry at this moment is saying let’s take a step back and look at what our film sets look like and make sure that we’re not missing out on something. Missing out on the opportunity to collaborate with people who have different perspectives or can bring something new to the table and who might not have had those opportunities in the past because there is a tendency to just go for what’s familiar. You go for what feels familiar and often what feels familiar is yourself.</p><p>So, in spite of the fact that I have always worked with wonderful women and wonderful collaborators who I would never want to make a movie without these days, I definitely am looking at the wider body of our crews and making sure that they’re reflective of the world around us. I think that’s what everyone is doing and that’s a beautiful thing.</p><p>And I’m not perfect in it, no one is, but to just all of a sudden have that be part of your process when you’re putting a movie together is very… it’s a wonderful thing. It’s a really exciting thing because all of a sudden you just see the ways in which your movies are going to get better.</p><p><b>Do you write it into your scripts or do you say to your casting agents, “Anyone, this could be anyone”?</b></p><p>I say “anyone” but I’ve also learned that it’s important to write it into the scripts too, because there is that tendency with casting—and it’s nothing against the casting directors—but they assume [that because] I’m a white guy that I’m going to want to see a bunch of white people. So I’m now very consciously writing into the scripts making sure that there’s that diaspora represented on the screen as well.</p><p>I wish I could just say it’s open to anybody but I found that if I don’t inject that into the screenplay then I’m only going to see a certain number of actors who all look a certain way. Maybe if I want to be truly color-blind I would in an ideal world not have to do that, I would just see everybody, see actors of all ethnicities, of all creeds, of all colors and I’d get to pick the best actor. But that’s not where we are right now and it’s very helpful in terms of moving the needle to actually go into the screenplay and make sure that you specify that someone is not Caucasian. Or even “not male”.</p><p>In <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i> there are a lot of characters in the movie who in the script were ‘bank manager number one’, ‘bank manager number two’, ‘bank manager number three’, and something that was very important for me to do was to give them all names, and then as we were casting to never bring in actors for any specific part. I just said bring in a bunch of actors, I’m not going to tell you who they’re for I just want to meet a bunch of people. And in doing that I met lots of men, women, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, I met everybody.</p><p>And then I could just start filling the cast in that way but I just never had people audition for any specific role because that way you free yourself from those expectations and no one knows who you’re bringing these actors in for. The casting director doesn’t know who you’re actually looking at them for and the actors don’t know either and so it just liberates you a little bit. You can’t do that for every part but it was really great on <i>Old Man &amp; the Gun</i> to be able to do that and it’s beautiful to just fill a movie with people who don’t look the same, there’s just something so special.</p><p><b>It’s possibly making a bit more work for yourself?</b></p><p>It does, but that’s good work. It’s good work. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/geena-davis-two-easy-steps-664573\">Geena Davis said something about how when you write, in terms of getting more women on screen, when you write a crowd scene just write into the script “50% of this crowd is women”.</a></p><p>And that is one of those things that you wish you didn’t have to do but it makes everything work, it makes it so much easier because then the assistant director will read that and was like, “oh we need to have 50%”. They’ll take it literally because that’s their job, to take everything literally and then you wind up with a crowd scene of extras, 50% of whom are women.</p><p><b>And does also reading something like that flip a switch in your brain that maybe wasn’t flipped?</b></p><p>Definitely. I mean it’s very important to be open about the fact that that switch had not been flipped, I just took for granted the fact that I work with a lot of great women. But I certainly never thought about it in a cultural perspective and I never thought about from a woman’s perspective. But now I am and I feel like I’m a much better person for doing so.</p><p><!--figure[7]--></p><p><b>A nerdy question: in your wildest dream when you began being a filmmaker could you have imagined making not one but two films with the great Robert Redford?</b></p><p>No. But also because when I first started making movies those weren’t the movies I was interested in, you know? I wanted to make, from an early age, <i>Star Wars</i> movies, so I didn’t even become aware of Robert Redford until I became aware of the Sundance Film Festival when I was 11 or 12 or 13.</p><p>And so for me the goal was always to be associated with him through his festival. The goal for me to be a part of what he’d created. His films came later. I got to know him more as a director than as an actor because I saw <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-river-runs-through-it/\">A River Runs Through It</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/quiz-show/\">Quiz Show</a></i>, I think the first thing I saw him in was <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-horse-whisperer/\">The Horse Whisperer</a></i>. It was only later that I got to know all those early classics. I saw <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid/\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> </i>shockingly late in life… So working with him twice now I recognize the weight of it but it certainly wasn’t on my checklist of things to do. It’s really been a nice surprise to fall into alignment with him in the way that I have.</p><p><b>What’s the best thing about working with him? What do we not know about the way that he works that you would like people to know?</b></p><p>I feel like everyone sort of expects this and it’s not going to be a surprise but that it’s just so laid back and fun. He just really likes to have fun. He&rsquo;s very, very playful and that twinkle in his eye that we know and love on the big screen is there when you&rsquo;re working with him because he loves doing what he does. And he doesn&rsquo;t take himself seriously. He takes the work seriously but he doesn&rsquo;t take himself seriously and neither do I and so I think one of the reasons we get along so well is because we both are just having fun doing it.</p><p><i><b>Intermission: here’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/david-lowerys-top-5-robert-redford-films/\">David Lowery’s five favorite Robert Redford performances</a> (plus one more).</b></i></p><p><b>You directed one of the great recent live-action family films, <i>Pete’s Dragon</i>. What are your earliest movie memories?</b></p><p>Well, I grew up without a television. My parents wouldn’t let us have a TV and so my earliest memories were going to the cinema and I saw <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pinocchio/\">Pinocchio</a></i> and<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/et-the-extra-terrestrial/\"> <i>E.T. </i></a>Those were the first two films I saw and I was obsessed with them. But I didn’t have a way to watch them again so we’d go to the library and at that time you could get storybooks of movies like <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars/\">Star Wars</a></i> or for <i>E.T.</i> there were storybooks that had lots of photographs in them and so I would just get those books and read them repeatedly. I didn’t even see <i>Star Wars </i>for a couple of years after I had become aware of it. I knew the entire story but it was just through the books.</p><p>And finally one day my grandparents taped it off the television and showed it to me. I finally got to see it but I knew the whole story backwards and forwards at that point.</p><p>I remember wanting to see <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/clash-of-the-titans/\">Clash of the Titans</a></i>. I was really into Greek mythology and so I knew that <i>Clash of the Titans</i> was a Greek mythology film and had Medusa in it and so finally we rented this TV and VCR and I went and got <i>Clash of the Titans</i> from the video store and just watched it four times. Like, I just watched it over and over again because I knew that I only had that one weekend to see it.</p><p><b>When you were making <i>Pete’s Dragon</i> was there a sense that you wanted kids to have a similar experience?</b></p><p>Definitely. I just really tried to make a movie that I would have loved when I was seven. That was the barometer. I feel very in touch with me as a seven year old! I feel like I ceased to mature at the age of seven and so it’s not hard for me to tap into that mindset and I just would think about the things that I liked and often what I liked at seven years old were the movies that would scare me. Or that would provoke some emotion in me that I didn’t know how to handle.</p><p>I was terrified of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ghostbusters/\">Ghostbusters</a></i>. I had seen the beginning of it at a friend’s house and it terrified me but I couldn’t stop thinking about it and so that was like a really exciting thing to me. The idea of finding that balance of fear and scariness to inject into a movie that would have hooked me at that age, even though it would also have traumatized me to a certain extent. And then also making sure that it was a movie that I as a 37 year old would also really, really like.</p><p><!--figure[8]--></p><p><b>Since we’ve talked quite a bit about women in film, could you please pimp your wife <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/augustine-frizzell/\">Augustine Frizzell</a>’s new movie?</b></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/never-goin-back/\"><i>Never Goin’ Back</i></a>? It just came out in the States on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Goin-Back-Camila-Morrone/dp/B07G2JRGY8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543875745&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=never+goin%27+back\">Amazon Prime</a>, I think it’ll be on DVD at Christmas. It’s based on her life. When she was 15 she moved out on her own with her brother and just had the most uproariously ridiculous experience as a young, underage teenager living on her own as an adult and it could have gone horribly wrong. It involved everything that you have seen in movies like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/thirteen/\"><i>Thirteen</i></a>, where it’s just drugs and darkness and terrible things, but for some reason not only did she emerge from it unscathed but she looks at it with a sense of humor.</p><p>So she wanted to tell her story as a comedy as opposed to being the typical cautionary tale for young people. She was like, “We were really having a lot of fun back then. We were doing things we should not have been doing but it was a lot of fun, we were being idiots but there’s something glorious about that and the fact that I emerged as a fully formed adult who hasn’t killed too many brain cells, there’s something valuable about that.”</p><p>And so she wanted to make what is essentially a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/superbad/\"><i>Superbad</i></a>-style comedy for teenage girls. Some of the things that she did I am just like, “Seriously? That really happened and you are the person you are now?!”</p><p>And it’s great… I could go on with the long version.</p><p><b>Go on! We are all about husbands using half their interview time to talk about their wives.</b></p><p>She made the movie in 2014. Just jumped right into it, she got a grant the same way I got a grant from the Awesome Film Society to make my first film<i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/st-nick/\">St Nick</a>.</i> She got a couple of grand together and made a version of the movie that she wasn’t happy with.</p><p>She made it right before we came here to New Zealand [to make <i>Pete’s Dragon</i>]. So she finished it, got on a plane to New Zealand, edited it and I remember around Christmas of that year watching the first cut. It was good, there was good stuff in it, but she was not happy with it. She felt like she hadn’t quite done what she wanted it to do. And so we started talking about re-shooting part of it or re-shooting the things that weren’t working.</p><p>And at a certain point she just decided, “I’m going to remake the entire thing. From scratch.” So she turned the feature that she had made into <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/i-was-a-teenage-girl/\">a short film</a>.</p><p>And that film placed at SXSW and a couple of other places, and then she rewrote the script and recast it and when we made <i>A Ghost Story </i>and sold it to A24, we took proceeds from that and just put it right into her movie and used that to pay for her film. So she made the same film twice and the second time it worked, it was exactly the movie she wanted to make.</p><p>And now she has a career as a director and she’s about to make <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/stoned-alone/\">a Ryan Reynolds movie</a>. It is a sequel to <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/home-alone/\">Home Alone</a></i>. The working title that was announced under is <i>Stoned Alone. </i></p><p>And, like, that is nothing that she could have ever planned for but because she’s a female director who made a really bawdy comedy, people reacted to it in a way that they wouldn’t have had a guy made that film. And I’m her husband so it’s easy for me to say this, but I’m just so proud of her for sticking to her guns, realizing that she could do better, making the film a second time and she’s reaping the rewards of having stuck to her intuition and not put a lesser, inferior version of the film out into the world.</p><p><b>As a collaborative partnership, you also did something really important, which is reinvest the money from your film into her film.</b></p><p>Our marriage luckily is founded on a mutual love of movies and so every decision we make about everything comes back to that love of movies. So it just made sense that if she had a movie she wanted to make I would do anything I could to make that happen. And that was one really efficient way to make sure her movie got made more quickly.</p><p>I’ve read the script and I don’t want to say too much about it, but as a fan of the first two <i>Home Alone</i> movies, I think this is a great follow up.</p><p><b>Because we’re at an event that is all about story and script, whose scripts have you studied closely or do you go back to again and again?</b></p><p>I go back to scripts that feel really messy, so I love Paul Thomas Anderson’s movies. He’s my favorite filmmaker but I also love his screenplays because they are just full of mistakes.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/punch-drunk-love/\"><i>Punch-Drunk Love</i></a> script was published with all of the revised pages so it’s this multicolored document, and you see in that the process of revision that he goes through, and the process of intervention. It’s full of typos and they are so sloppy, but you see the things that matter to him like the fact that he will always randomly imprint that he’s dropping what lens he wants to shoot a shot on.</p><p>The <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/phantom-thread/\">Phantom Thread</a></i> screenplay is also full of typos, and I read an interview with Daniel Day Lewis where he said that he loves the typos and tries to incorporate them into the dialogue. So if there is a typo in the dialogue he’ll make that part of the character because it just amuses him so much that the scripts are so sloppy.</p><p>So those are scripts that I like to go back to, just because it’s refreshing to look at something that is not perfect on the page. Out of that miasma they’re able to pull these movies that are just so, in my opinion, brilliant.</p><p><b>It shows a process where he’s obviously in a hurry to get the ideas out rather than to get them perfect.</b></p><p>Yes exactly, exactly. He doesn’t spend too much time polishing it. He just gets it out there on the page, he’s like, “we’re going to be able to make a movie from this document, but this document itself does not need to be perfectly refined. The refinement will come later.”</p><p><!--figure[9]--></p><p><b>Last question: A24. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/search/lists/a24/\">Letterboxd members love the indie film production and distribution company</a>. What have you personally gained from being in “the house of A24”?</b></p><p>I guess a lot of cool points, maybe? I don’t know! As someone who is a fan of studio logos there’s always like this certain thrill you get when you see a logo appear on screen that promises something. And you don’t have that that often any more. I feel like there was a period where like Lionsgate used to do that. I remember the old Lionsgate logo that was just the constellation. And you knew it was going to be a certain type of movie. There was like this really weird Canal Plus one that had these weird sounds and it was very strange.</p><p>So with A24, in spite of the fact that they make so many different types of movies, they all are within a certain scale. A scale that allows for there to be something, not subversive, but just surprising. They can take more risks and so even if you don’t know what the movie is, you know there’s a possibility for it to go in a direction that you can’t anticipate and that’s exciting.</p><p>They also are just very creative about how they get the word out about their movies and that contributes to that sense of culture. I don’t have much social media, I have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/davidpatricklowery/\">Instagram</a> and that’s it. But I know they’re very active on social media, and they don’t take themselves too seriously and they make everyone feel part of that. They’re very inclusive.</p><p>And so it’s easy to feel as a film fan, not just as a filmmaker, but as a fan, that you are part of a movement when you go see one of their movies or when you talk about one of their movies. There’s a scary aspect of it which is you wonder how long it can last? Because as a company they’re going to need to grow and I know because I’m continuing to make movies with them that they recognize that themselves, and are looking for ways to do that without changing what makes A24 so exciting.</p><p>I feel very grateful to have a front-row seat as a fan to see how they’re continuing to make movies, how they’re continuing to evolve, and I look forward to being part of that process myself.</p>"

What would that lead to?</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><i>Phil Johnston (co-director/co-writer):</i> And so knowing that he still had quite a bit of insecurity, he still had farther to go in his journey. And we had only known Vanellope for like 35 minutes or 40 minutes. So she has a whole other story. We had to keep going with these characters.</p><p><b>On the challenge of visualising the Internet:</b><br/><i>PJ</i>: After several horrible ideas that didn’t really make sense, we finally landed on something where we thought of it like an old city like Rome or Istanbul where the ancient city is buried deep beneath. Then they build a new version on top of that and a new version on top of that. And that’s kind of actually what the Internet is. You go down to the guts of it and you find like, a city that is multi, multi-layered with the newest, biggest websites up on top. Then the old forgotten stuff is down at the bottom.</p><p><b>On why the movie didn’t go with the seemingly obvious title of <i>Ralph Wrecks The Internet</i>:<br/></b><i>RM</i>: It’s one of those conundrums where no matter what you call it, someone is going to say, “Well, but shouldn’t it be <i>Ralph Breaks the Internet </i>since that’s the expression?” And since we liked that it has a dual meaning of him going viral and then also actually destroying the Internet, we thought, let’s go with that. Let’s go with <i>Ralph Breaks the Internet</i>. Knowing that there would be a backlash of “shouldn’t it be called…”.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On Ralph’s journey in the new film:<br/></b><i>John C. Reilly: </i><b> </b>The character, it was initially even conceived as a fish-out-of-water kind of character. That was a lot of what we played with in the first film—how does Ralph behave in a game that’s not his own? And then the Internet is this literally infinite landscape. There’s a lot of really fun metaphors that we’re also playing with in the film. And this idea that the arcade is like the childhood kind of arena of their friendship and the Internet represents the sort of larger world beyond as they grow and mature. And like you mentioned, Phil, Ralph really worked so hard to get a friend in that first one. And then Vanellope starts to grow and mature and realizing that she wants to feel like she belongs somewhere and it’s not her candy game. So I think a lot of kids and adults are finding a lot of stuff in the film that they can really relate to in terms of the way relationships evolve. So I think there’s something here for a lot of people. And certainly a lot of jokes that operate on a lot of different levels.</p><p><b>On being a Disney princess and whether it will affect her stand-up act:<br/></b><i>Sarah Silverman:</i><b> </b>Will it affect my act? Will it affect my attitude? I don’t know that it will affect my act. Although everything affects my act. Just living. But yeah. It’s a thrill. And the idea of Disney princess, what makes it good is that it has grown and changed. That Disney has taken on progress and inclusivity and has grown and changed in positive ways. And where a classic Disney princess, and really, this movie just faces it head on: you get saved by a man. And you’re in great distress. Your life is threatened. And then someone else saves you. And then to all in one movie acknowledge all of that and then shatter it is so exciting. And to get to be this kid who becomes like a princess with an attainable waist line. And wearing comfortable clothes.</p><p>As a comic, this is really going a different direction, but we end up in diners late at night after shows. And who also ends up at diners late at night are young girls coming out of the clubs, dance clubs and stuff like that. I would see young women in half shirts and sky-high heels. And they’re freezing cold. They’re shivering. And their feet hurt. I just wish I could tell them that they don’t have to be uncomfortable to deserve love. Boys are not raised to think that they ever have to sacrifice comfort to be loved. I would be in my hoodie and jeans and just think: these girls don’t think that they can get love without this insane amount of physical discomfort. And I love that Vanellope kind of sheds light on these grown-up princesses that are uncomfortable hanging out. And someone was talking about it months and months ago [on Twitter], and I said: yeah, she’s Jewish. I just made her Jewish. Now it’s canon which I enjoy.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On the internet:<br/></b><i>SS: </i>For a comedian, Twitter is a great place to try out jokes or where you just have a funny thought and you want to put it out there or whatever. But then it became the place where I take in my news. And now I wantonly look back on the times when I was funny on it. But yeah. It’s something. I think the internet, because it was new for us; kids: it’s all they know. And I wonder in what ways that’s good and bad. But we had to learn how to navigate and how to protect ourselves. It’s like anything. There can be way too much of it. It’s nice as a treat. And there are bells that can’t be unwrung that probably happen a couple of times a week or a day or in the middle of the night.</p><p>But I think there’s a lot of good in the internet. It’s brought the world a lot closer. It’s made it a lot smaller. And then of course there are terrible things about it. A lot of misinformation. This new world of chaos. And lack of knowing what is true I would attribute to the internet. But also learning truths about other people that I would have never known. Culturally. Like waking up to my own white privilege had a lot to do with the internet for what it’s worth. It’s a very complicated relationship, the internet, that we all have. And we have to try to find a healthy balance.</p><p><i>JCR</i>: I went in and met with the animators a couple of times to talk about the way Ralph moves. And establish a relationship with them so that I could feel like I was working in concert with them. And I remember this one really moving conversation I had with them where I realized, the internet is like, the central issue of our time. Our relationship to this technology, its power, and its effect on us, we don’t even quite understand yet. It’s as powerful as a nuclear bomb. But it uses other means. So it was really exciting in the context of an entertaining Disney film to be able to talk about some of these issues in a really real way. Its effect on people. Why do we crave the anonymous acceptance of people we don’t know? The way we’re bombarded with commerce on the internet. So we made this fun entertaining story. But you come away from the film thinking about some of the most important issues of our time.</p>"

What you learned from Roger was that from day one, he made you do things you were completely unqualified to do. And he would say things like, “You’re smart, you graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford, of course you can do it!”. I would say “No, I know nothing about this.” He’d reply “Oh you’ll learn!” And you did, because if you didn’t learn, you didn’t last.

And if you did mind working 20 hours a day, seven days a week, it wasn’t the right job for you.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>And that’s another thing I learned there, film is a collaborative medium. It’s teamwork. And at Roger Corman’s, everyone’s a part of the team. Everyone helped everyone else out. So you never had this feeling that you were lost in the wilderness and everyone was hoping for you to fail. Everyone wanted you to succeed if they felt that you deserved it and you worked hard. So I had the support of everyone from Joe Dante and Jon Davison and Mike Finnell. I learned how to do everything. I learned how to cut trailers, and I learned how to market, I was head of marketing for [Corman’s outfit] New World Pictures. I cast films. I was a location manager. I emptied chemical toilets in motor homes. Which is the one really important skill if there every really is a zombie apocalypse.</p><p>And the other thing I learned is that you’re never too good to do anything. If it really needs to be done, I don’t care if you’re a producer, I don’t care what role you have in a film, if you’re the person with the time and the ability, you do it. And those were all important skill sets. Also, he taught me how to do everything for nothing. Which is another important skill set in Hollywood. But because of the teamwork aspect, I met Jim Cameron when he was building spaceship models for <i>Battle Beyond The Stars </i>(1980). And then I lobbied for him to become the art director of the film, which he became and succeeded at tremendously, and then he was one of the visual effects DPs and technicians on that film.</p><p><b>On Debra Hill, co-writer and producer of <i>Halloween</i>, among other movies:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> The other person I should give a huge shout out to, another one of my mentors, the late Debra Hill. She doesn’t get the credit she deserves, and I would not have a career without her. Without her guidance, without her having helped to create <i>Halloween </i>and so many great films and I just don’t want her name to be lost. She died way too soon. So let’s keep her legend alive. She really helped me a great deal when I was transitioning from working for Roger Corman to going out on my own.</p><p><b>On breaking away from Roger Corman:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> I didn’t wanna do it. I thought I’d be working for Roger forever. I mean, that’s just the way you thought back then. I produced a film for him called <i>Smokey Bites The Dust</i>. Not <i>Smokey And the Bandit</i>. And he called me and said, “I can’t teach you anything else, you really need to go out on your own”. And in the meantime, Jim and I had started collaborating on <i>The Terminator</i>. We brought Roger the script and he said, “I don’t have the money to finance this at the budget level where it’s going to be successful,” which is also another great lesson: the self-knowledge to know that. And also, to be able to encourage people to leave the nest. It’s very difficult in this business to let people go on to success without, you know, hitching your cart to their horse. And he basically said, “I’m comfortable with what I’m doing, but you guys need to go out on your own”.</p><p><b>On struggling to mount <i>The Terminator</i>:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> We had 99 rejections and the hundredth time we pitched it, someone finally said yes. But it really was game-changing because the lesson I learned from Roger about team-work and having someone else’s back and caring about the project first and foremost, was a lesson that really was put to the test on <i>The Terminator</i>. Because that could’ve gone off the deep end. We got notes to end the film before the end of the film, to not even have the Terminator rise out of the ashes as the endo-skeleton. It’s your first movie and you’re telling people, “No, you’re wrong”—it&rsquo;s not an easy thing to do. And there are also more unsung heroes, because one of our strongest supporters was the head of the completion bond company, Film Finances, here in Los Angeles. The late Lindsley Parsons Sr, who knew what <i>The Terminator </i>was going to be. Roger knew what <i>The Terminator </i>was going to be. And not a lot of people did. And you absolutely need people to believe in you, and you need people to tell you when you’re screwing up, that you can listen to. And Lindsley was all of that, Roger has always been all of that. But we could’ve bowed to the pressure, or we could’ve been wrong and not listened to the things that make it all better. But your first time, it’s so difficult, but luckily we had each other’s backs.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>On fighting for respect for <i>The Terminator</i>:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> The head of marketing at Orion at the time basically said, “We’re embarrassed to release this movie. It’s a down-and-dirty exploitation movie. And once word of mouth gets out, it’ll be out of theaters after the first weekend. So we’re not even going to give you advertising support for the second weekend.”</p><p>And even thought it’s commonplace today, the head of marketing so hated the film, he didn’t want to screen it for critics. Which in 1984 just wasn’t done. God bless him, Michael Biehn’s agent, the late Ed Limato, who represented Richard Gere and Mel Gibson and Denzel Washington, in addition to Michael Biehn, called up Orion, said, “I’ve seen the movie, it’s fantastic. If you don’t believe in the films you make, I don’t know that I’m gonna have any of my actors work for you.” And they screened the film for critics, and it got on <i>Time</i> magazine’s Ten Best of the Year list. So it really takes a village. And I think we live in an environment of fear right now where there are very few people who will stand up for you the way that Lindsley Parsons did, and the way that Ed Limato did. That’s why we have to be there for each other.</p><p><b>On facing Hollywood sexism even after the success of <i>The Terminator</i>:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> When Fox agreed that Jim would direct <i>Aliens</i>, I had gone for an interview and the first question I was asked was, “How could a little girl like you produce a big movie like this?”. I’ve never really been a shy or retiring type, and it was all I could do to just sit there and not walk out. I said, “Why don’t check my references? In fact, even better, I’ll have them call you.” So when the head of Film Finances called, Roger called, and various other people called saying, “Not only can she do this, you’d be lucky to have her,” I got the job. But I earned it. And then I went to England to make <i>Aliens</i>, and honestly it felt like I was the Wizard of Oz, everyone was like, “Who’s really behind the curtain? Who’s really producing this?” And once again, it was someone having my back. There was a gentlemen who was heading up Fox in the UK, the late Tim Hampton, and when anyone would call him he would say, “Gale’s producing the movie. No you can’t call me. I am not producing the movie.” And people would argue with him. It was very challenging. And I thought it was crazy because Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister of England at the time, I thought they were a lot more advanced. They weren’t. Not in film.</p><p><b>On continuing her career away from James Cameron:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> I want to give an acknowledgement to people who didn’t need to help me then. Jim and I were getting divorced and it could’ve been a business where people basically said, “Ah, we’re gonna close the door and you’re gonna be an outsider,” and I actually got an overall deal at Fox. So there were a lot of people who believed I’d earned my stripes. And film is very much still a ‘director as auteur’ medium, but they saw that I contributed as a producer. That’s also why I gravitated toward television, because television is very much a producer’s medium, more so than film.</p><p><b>On the power of genre storytelling:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> Let’s hear it for science fiction, fantasy and horror. Because Stephen Hawking only came up with the idea that we need to worry about AI and robots about two and half years before he passed away. And I remember saying to Jim, “If he’d only watched <i>The Terminator</i>, he’d be way ahead of the game.” We are cutting edge. We create and think about things that scientists and physicists and mathematicians aren’t even considering. And the more leaps and bounds being made in technology right now, the more fearful we should be that these scenarios may come to pass. Because the one thing they don’t teach in engineering schools and in biotech, is ethics. To think about not only consequences, but unintended consequences. If you go to medical school, there’s the Hippocratic Oath: “First, do no harm.” I think we really need that in all of these new technologies.</p><p><b>On the most memorable moment of her career:<br/></b><i>GAH:</i> I would say the first screening  of <i>The Terminator</i> that we had on Hollywood Boulevard—a midnight screening where people went crazy. And we had no idea up until then, we didn’t have a number of out-of-town screenings. We didn’t really have test screenings. There had been one that didn’t go well. So we were afraid that maybe the marketing guys at Orion would be right and there would be terrible word of mouth and after the second weekend we would be out of theaters. So that was the biggest high of my career, standing in the back of the theater watching the film and watching the audience watch the film. And also standing at the back of the theater watching <i>Aliens</i>, and literally watching people have a visceral reaction to the film. Nothing’s better than that. And that’s one of the reasons I love film—because it brings all of us together in the dark theater to experience something.</p>"

It’s his first stint with the genre of horror, it breaks through the barriers of censorship unlike any film before and over the years, it has played a major role in influencing not only films but pop-culture as well.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinemaclown/film/psycho/\">CinemaClown</a><br/></p></blockquote><!--figure[2]--><p>2. <i><b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alien/\">Alien</a></b></i> (1979, USA)<br/><i>Directed by Ridley Scott</i></p><blockquote><p>“When shit hits the fan it comes with the best first impression of any monster.

I feel as though I wish I could warn all of the other characters in the movie to walk on eggshells, don’t upset him! Maybe you shouldn’t talk to him right now! Can’t you see it! Just leave him alone! There has never been another character to give me such all-consuming anxiety.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/holliehorror/film/the-shining/\">HollieHorror</a><br/></p></blockquote><!--figure[4]--><p>4. <b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-thing/\">The Thing</a></i></b> (1982, USA)<br/><i>Directed by John Carpenter</i></p><blockquote><p>“The man responsible for the movie’s stomach-churning physical effects deserves most of the credit for its appeal and success. Rob Bottin worked so hard he was hospitalized for exhaustion, pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer! And he was only 21 at the time! Pure underrated genius.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/stods/film/the-thing/\">Josh Stoddard</a><br/></p></blockquote><!--figure[5]--><p>5. <b><i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rosemarys-baby/\">Rosemary’s Baby</a></i></b> (1968, USA)<br/><i>Directed by Roman Polański</i></p><blockquote><p>“I’m awestruck by how good this is.

Even with all the VFX-heavy films that are commonplace now, the shark is [as] scary and compelling now as it was in 1975. The camerawork is masterful, and it feels like films now are still trying to catch up to what was happening behind the camera on this movie.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ejxmoreno/film/jaws/\">EJ Moreno</a></p></blockquote><!--figure[8]--><p>8. <b><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/demons-1971/\">修羅</a></b> <b><i>(Demons)</i></b> (1971, Japan)<br/><i>Directed by Toshio Matsumoto</i></p><blockquote><p>“Matsumoto è stato uno dei più grandi innovatori del cinema giapponese e fonte di ispirazione di grandi registi del cinema mondiale.

Here’s some highlights:</p><p><b>On going from setting her films in the real world to the world of science-fiction:<br/></b><i>Claire Denis:</i> Very honestly, I have to say the most important thing was happening between the characters. The space thing was more just a situation where people are together, but forever until they die, you know? Where there is no hope to escape. Not space, really, but the ultimate jail.</p><p><b>On casting Robert Pattinson in a role originally intended for an older actor:<br/></b><i>CD:</i> He was right from the very minute I met him. But the delay [in getting the film made] helped me to realize it was better. This original dream was to have this older man, tired with life, at the end wishing nothing but to die. Robert brought something I had not expected. But I was a little bit afraid to be honest. I think I was afraid, not of his youth… I was afraid maybe he was too good-looking, or too… precious to me, in a way. I thought I had to be aware of that, and not to be afraid of his charisma.</p><p><b>On discovering the works of Claire Denis:<br/></b><i>Robert Pattinson:</i> I saw <i>White Material</i> in maybe 2010 or 2011 on TV and just immediately… I really like directors who can create a very specific world which just feels contained in a movie. I think I started trying to chase her down which took about three years, maybe longer, four years, to get a meeting, and when this came about, it was kind of… I never really thought she’d do a movie completely in English as well so I was kinda shocked.</p><p><i>CD:</i> The truth is we wrote the script in French, but for me it had to be in English because there was no way for me that people in space could speak French. It would be so funny. [It had to be] either English or Russian.</p><p><b>On acting alongside an infant for long stretches:<br/></b><i>RP:</i> It kind of changed who I thought the character was completely. He put so much pressure on himself the whole time that I thought he would put that pressure on his daughter, and that would create an incredibly intense relationship. But then you find just in the performance, you can’t help but be quite soft to a baby. I planned to be a lot stranger and something just felt wrong with all those scenes. I think it softened the whole performance really, especially in terms of what I was initially intending to do. People say don’t work with animals and children, [but] I think it makes it exponentially easier, to have someone who’s a constant little font of inspiration all the time, you can just be totally reactive. You’re completely unselfconscious if you’re with a baby all the time.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On preparing for the role:<br/></b><i>RP:</i> I was attached to it for such a long time I was thinking about it for a really long time and I hung out with Claire a bunch in Paris. Claire gave this speech about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis for ages. And I was trying to think like, “Okay, I’m gonna play it like Ian Curtis,” and I’m trying to impose that into it, and then I was like, “So… how do I interpret Ian Curtis into Monte?” And Claire was like, “No no, it’s not about the part at all”. And I was just thinking there’s something about just getting anything that’s in the ether, it’s not a literal interpretation of something, it’s just kind of letting stuff enter you.</p><p><i>CD:</i> About Ian Curtis, it was crazy for me to say that to Robert in a café in Paris, but there was something, a strange connection in me about [Curtis], being that young guy, famous suddenly and yet so alone. So young and so alone and every image I saw of him was like the world was not a friend to him. Even though he loved his wife, he was surrounded by trouble, by enemies, there was pain in his body, even his movement, there was something of a young monk in a way. Of course I didn’t want Robert to interpret Ian Curtis but to me it was the image of a young knight of the middle ages, alone in the modern world. That was something I had in mind.</p><p><b>On how he chooses his roles:<br/></b><i>RP:</i> In general, it’s pretty simple. I’ll have seen the director’s work, and very few things hit me as hard as Claire’s work did for instance. If something has a pretty profound effect on me I’ll try and go work with those people. I basically approach people who I really love and just say, “I don’t care what part it is, or anything to do with a specific project. Whatever you would like to do with me at any point in the future…” And it generally seems to work out. With Cronenberg on <i>Cosmopolis</i>, I really loved the script but I was so afraid of talking to him because I didn’t know how to talk about the part in an academic and cerebral way, but I knew I really liked it. I was trying to get out of even a phone conversation with David because I was so terrified of being humiliated on the phone, and then I kind of finally got tricked into talking to him about it and I was, “I’m so sorry David, I really like it, but I literally don’t know… I don’t know what it’s about, I don’t know how to do anything,” and David said to me, “Yeah me neither, I have no idea what it’s about. But it seems juicy right?”</p><p>Every single job I’ve ever done from that point on, I have to say to the director at the beginning: “I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t know how to act. I don’t know what the part is. I’m just rolling the dice on a take-to-take basis. I’ve got about a one in six hit rate. That’s probably why I don’t do that many commercial movies because you can’t really do that in a corporate machine. You can’t say, “I have no idea what I’m doing”.</p><p><b>On Robert Pattinson:<br/></b><i>CD:</i> There is always something that is hidden. Something escaped behind his face, behind his skin, inside, a sort of, it’s not resisting any direction, it’s existing I would say. Which is probably what David Cronenberg liked also. Existing.</p>"

He joined the Coens on stage following the screening for a discussion of the work. Here’s some highlights:</p><p><b>On the origins of the project:<br/></b><i>Joel Coen: </i>The first story [we wrote] was the first story in the movie. These are stories that were written over 25 years really, so that goes way back, that one. They follow, with a couple of exceptions, in a kind of chronological order in terms of when they were written, roughly. They just got put in a drawer because they were short movies and we didn’t know what we were gonna do with them. We probably didn’t even expect to make them until maybe eight or ten years ago when we started thinking, “well, maybe we could do these”. They could be seen as a sequenced series of stories or tracks on a record album or something like that. It’s a weird animal in terms of the format.</p><p><b>On whether or not they considered merging the stories into one larger narrative:<br/></b><i>JC: </i>No. Like I said before we had these stories, they were all westerns so there was that and then they seemed to relate to each other, but kind of retrospectively, rather than consciously when we started doing it. There was never the impulse to [combine them] but as I said it’s kind of a strange form but it grew out of just the odd nature of how they came into existence.</p><p><b>On the experience of the actors:<br/></b><i>Tim Blake Nelson: </i>We all got to read the entire script before we shot our individual constituent parts, unrelated to the others, but I think probably as actors we all felt a responsibility toward the genre of each film in which we appear. Because what I think is astonishing about this is it’s six different movies within the Western genre but then each one is in the vernacular of a sub-genre in and of itself. And that, at least for me, and I’m pretty sure with the other actors, just underscored one’s responsibility to appear indelibly within the genre in which you appeared. And so understanding that and then getting to see the successes of the others, it was just really rewarding to encounter that in all the stories. So that’s what was most gratifying about seeing the whole, was experiencing the success of others.</p><p><b>On the public confusion over whether or not this was a series or a movie, and whether or not any stories got culled:<br/></b><i>JC: </i>I think that’s an artifact of what a strange animal it is. None of us really knew what to call it or how to classify it. Aside from the confusion about the classification, what we were going to shoot, the length of all the stories, which vary, there was never anything we were considering doing differently. There were never any more stories, and they were always intended to be seen together as a group.</p><p><b>On the large presence of animals in the film, which prominently features a dog and and owl, among other critters:<br/></b><i>JC: </i>Flies are very hard to work with. There are a lot of animals. We do tend to load the movies up with domestic animals don’t we? It’s a Western, there are horses. It is true, I have to say, you do a Western, you spend 90% of your time dealing with and thinking about the horses.</p><p><i>Ethan Coen: </i>And the oxen. The oxen were new to us. I asked Travis, who was the oxen wrangler, we wanted the oxen to do something specific for a take, and I asked him if he could do that and he just sighed. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said, “Driving oxen is not self-evident”.</p><p><b>On collaborating on this film with longtime composer Carter Burwell:<br/></b><i>EC: </i>As Tim said, they’re all Westerns but they’re such different kinds of stories, we would talk about to what extent the music should play off those different [genres] and to what extent it should tie the things together. It’s a question we confronted. They’re so different. How much are you gonna accent the differences and how much are you gonna say it’s all the same movie [with the music]?</p><p><i>JC: </i>It’s something that wasn’t just limited to the music, it’s an issue that came up in terms of the shooting styles and the color timing look of the movie, and how much to differentiate between the different stories and how much not to. How much to push that and how much to pull back a little bit in terms of your original instincts about it. And that went through a lot of iterations. It’s the kind of thing that’s very easy to iterate and re-iterate now that color timing is done in a computer as opposed to photo-chemically, so that went back and forth a little bit too and sort of found its place.</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>On how Joel and Ethan have evolved over the years as filmmakers:<br/></b><i>TBN: </i>Yeah they finally know what they’re doing. They figured it out on this movie. [Big laughs from the crowd.] At a previous Q&amp;A I suddenly realized the oxymoronic nature of who and what Joel and Ethan are as directors and filmmakers, because they’re incredibly, unbelievably, in an unparalleled way, meticulous and prepared as filmmakers. So that when you get to the set there really are no decisions being made during the shooting time that could’ve been made earlier, and that rigor pays off in an interesting way because it allows for the actors inside of that meticulous preparation, to be utterly free, to have all the time an actor could possibly want. So I think it’s the amount of preparation, with which I became familiar on <i>O Brother</i>, and I’d never encountered before in any movie I’d done with any director, or directors. And it’s repeated once more here, with the added challenge I think for Joel and Ethan that they were making effectively six films with six different linguistic principals inside the language of the Western and I found the specificity with which they were working on the one I’m in, unbelievable in terms of its extremes and its fearlessness. And the way that they were pushing me, and in certain cases allowing me to do certain stuff. And then seeing the whole movie, watching five other versions of that, was truly astonishing. So what I guess I really mean to say is that the opposite of my joke is true: they continue to be unparalleled in terms of the work they put in, the preparation they do, and the specificity borne out of the shooting and also in the result.</p>"

Powered by a similar energy and propulsive storytelling; the film hops from astonishing setpiece to astonishing setpiece, soaring on the backs of Tom Cruise’s singular charisma and McQuarrie’s deft handle on the nuts and bolts of this franchise. The opera set piece is among my favorite from the action genre of this decade. Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust is a perfectly realized character for the genre and an impossibly seamless addition to this franchise. Everything is so beautiful, so thrilling and so well-realized; it’s difficult not to view McQuarrie’s future in filmmaking as one of the more exciting things on the current cinematic horizon.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/oliviawildehawt/film/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/3/\">Jared</a></p><!--figure[3]--><p>3. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mission-impossible/\"><i><b>Mission: Impossible</b></i></a> (1996)<br/>Directed by Brian De Palma</p><p>“Filled with so many fun sequences and intoxicating direction, I was able to forgive De Palma for the lack of interesting characters or relationships.

It’s really a testament to De Palma that any of this works. You gotta love all the faux-1990s tech employed too.

Hoffman clearly is relishing his role, taking what could have been a one-dimensional character and turning it into something darker and scarier.

There are ways of filming that are certainly good-looking, and then there are ways of filming nature where you feel you’re actually <i>in</i> that forest, and that’s what you and your DP <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/michael-mcdonough-1/\">Michael McDonough</a> have done. Some of our Letterboxd members (<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/melcastaneda/\">Melissa</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/masterlundy/\">MasterLundy</a>) wanted to know why you’re so drawn to filming in a rustic setting, in nature rather than in cities, and how you approach that in terms of your filming.</b></p><p>I think maybe it even surprises me! I think one logistical reason is that it is actually easier to film outside of a city, you know? I mean just in terms of garnering your resources and keeping a small footprint… though I’m excited by the photography of the metropolis and will endeavor at some point to do something like that. In fact, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/snake-feed/\">in my first film</a>, it was just interesting seeing them come into the city. It was a big deal, you know, sort of the bridge and tunnel experience was very photogenic in some ways.</p><p>I love the idea that when you film outside of a big city you can actually almost take your time more, in some ways. And I think the immersion is very related to some of the comfort that the actors can feel with Michael; that he’s willing to wear knee-pads and crouch down and be part of that inner circle of connection. Near a tent, near the fire-pit, or when they’re ministering to each other. And when that happens you feel a sense that you’ve been allowed to come close and that you’re with them.</p><p>And then of course to show the splendour and scope of the forest, stepping back and using the cinema tools that allow that: a wider lens, and the tripod, and stabilizing, and allowing the frame to be as big as possible.</p><p>So I think that outdoor spaces allow for that, whereas the indoor space is the box and the confinement and the geometry. It is much more established and familiar.</p><p><b>It’s cool to hear what Michael was doing physically. Quite often a camera is a long way away with a certain lens but in this case it felt, watching, that there were three characters—Will, Tom, and the camera.</b></p><p>At times, for sure, because the scenes were quiet. Coming in close, being very quiet about it. When we do those things we’re not using lights in the forest, we’re using all natural light, so maybe that’s also a really big help. You know, we’re reflecting things gently, we’re shielding certain hot spots but it’s done with flags and silks and bounce cards, not with big lights.</p><p><b>You’re not bringing in huge 6000Ks to the forest?</b></p><p>No, no! </p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>You filmed the unfilmable in a way, which is PTSD. These types of mental health conditions, which we can’t see, rely so much on character rather than action. Why was the notion of filming this condition so interesting and important to you and what have you learned about it along the way?</b></p><p>I was very influenced by a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Evil-Hours-Biography-Post-traumatic-Disorder/dp/1494509679\"><i>The Evil Hours</i></a> by David J. Morris, that is a chronicle by a marine—who is also a journalist—who put such specific words to what it was like to try to understand what was happening inside him and inside other men. And he also was informed very much by a woman, because another very significant sector or arena of PTSD is through sexual violence.</p><p>So, he looked back in history to how other philosophers and people in the medical and ‘helping’ professions had tried to understand it, and he looked really specifically at WWI and the poets of the UK who were able to put words to it. And then a couple of really humane doctors who were then the receivers of their words and it really opened the doctors’ minds because the poets could put such precision to it.</p><p>And so he looks at this almost miraculous time of gentle understanding and almost posits ‘can we have that now? Could we understand these ways? Could we replicate some of the things that were done in the British VA [Veterans’ Affairs] system after WWI?’, you know?</p><p>But the only way to get at this—I resonate with your point so much—is to try to extrude what is it that makes this particular person [Will] not want to come back in. What is he trying to stabilize and how is he doing it? He’s trying to find an environment in which there are very few triggers for him, where his hyper-vigilance is maintained at a kind of even keel, and where he’s very selectively choosing the things that he can still have faith in, that he can still admire and love on, which would be the elements of the forest, and his very loyal companion, his daughter. And to strip away that which clogs his system or causes such jitters that he doesn’t feel well.</p><p>So the practitioners, of course, that is one of their responsibilities. By administering certain kinds of tests and surveys, the VA tries relentlessly and tirelessly to say ‘hey, these are some things you might be feeling. You’re not alone’. They do a beautiful job in trying to put words to that which becomes one of the greatest mysteries, right? Why do we feel what we feel? How potent the brain is with its neurochemistry, and then what a formidable kind of organ the conscience is! The conscience can’t be quieted easily. It asks for answers. It asks for contemplation, you know?</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>So then, the story gets really interesting because, intersecting with Will’s PTSD, you have his daughter, a teenage girl, also coming of age, also coming into her consciousness. Can we talk for a while about finding Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie? She lives far away from you, in Wellington, New Zealand, and is mostly unknown outside her home country. You saw her audition tape via casting agents Kelly Barden and Paul Schnee. What was it you saw in that tape that led you down the path of choosing her?</b></p><p>In the tape it was, I think, the fact that she had immersed [herself] in the script and in reading the book. It was palpable in the way that she was choosing to be in the scene, and what she was expressing in the scene. But it’s very hard to tell off of one tape. That’s a very uncomfortable situation, so it required conversations to flush out the rest and the conversations were lyrical. She’s a very open-hearted person who’s generous of spirit in terms of how she wants to conduct a conversation.</p><p>So this is going so well and I’m actually really enjoying this conversation so much, her sincerity, and I said ‘wow’, after talking to her, to the people back home here. I said ‘I’d like to talk to her again because this is leaving a big imprint’.</p><p>And as I saw some of the auditions locally, I realised that some of the television and theater training had maybe taken away some of the gentle spontaneity that Thom’s been able to retain.</p><p><b>Because of <i>Winter’s Bone</i> and what it did for Jennifer Lawrence (earning her a Best Actress Oscar nomination), did you feel any responsibility along the lines of ‘Debra Granik’s making another film, there’s another role for a young breakout star, who’s it going to be?’. Or did you try to ignore the fact that there might be a lot of attention on it?</b></p><p>Yeah. The attention feels more intimidating than productive. So, you know, I don’t welcome that so much because I think to do things requires a lot of quiet. I think many actors that get blown up really big feel that every move, everything they say, they change their hair, oh my lord, it becomes so relentless and it becomes very hard to function within that, I believe. So I try to put some of that aside really and say ‘that’s not what I’m looking for’.</p><p>In terms of responsibility, I don’t wanna take that on. I don’t want to have that foisted on me. I need to just be ornery and say ‘back off!’ you know? ‘No!’ I’m trying to make small films. I’m not trying to create stars. I’m trying to create good roles for young women that go beyond passing The Bechdel Test, you know? I’m trying to create roles where women don’t have to take off their clothes to be interesting.</p><p><b>Thomasin and Ben did a lot of rehearsing together, and they had some intensive skills training with outdoor survival consultant Dr. Nicole Apelian. Without any spoilers, there’s a scene in which the weather turns cold and things become dire. It’s visceral and tense, they have to work fast to build shelter or someone could die. Can you give us a sense of what those filming days were like?</b></p><p>Yeah. Well. Even making that shelter is intense because it’s a very multi-tiered process. The skills trainer was on the set that day, and the trainer she’d also enlisted to help (named Alan). Ben was very committed to it. They’d already constructed one in rehearsal. He wanted it to be—and Nicole did too—a really viable shelter that would be the kind of shelter that could save a life, through just this basic, I wanna say geothermal engineering of heat retention. Trapping heat, that’s the goal. Trap it in the clothing and then the shelter.</p><p>It was intense because halfway through the day you know there’s a really big risk of losing time. And then we also had a really bad dilemma where sun came really strongly that day. The morning had been really misty and good for it, and we didn’t have the kind of silks where you can just block it out, and when the sun comes out robustly it just doesn’t matter, there’s not really much [you can do]. So we had to basically take the gamble that it was going to be the day-for-night. For the DP it was less of a gamble because he knows how to do it - it allows the illusion of night-time light.</p><p>But the day was hard. It had all of these physical things to navigate and so by the end when the shelter was built and they were finally in it, we had to do it as a rolling series, you know. We didn’t have time to do takes! They had to try a couple of versions.</p><p>I felt like a failure. I felt that how was it that I couldn’t figure out how to pace this day so that by the time they actually need to have their exchange we’ve got eleven minutes.</p><p><b>But you got it.</b></p><p>We got fragments of it that then can gel to give the ambience and the circumstances of how that night became dire for them.</p><p><b>Could you share with us any films that showed you a storytelling pathway for <i>Leave No Trace</i>?</b></p><p>I really relied on three documentaries as inspiration for this film and they were all done by British crews. One of them’s available on YouTube and it’s a very beautiful film called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/soldiers-in-hiding/\"><i>Soldiers in Hiding</i></a>, and it’s about Vietnam-era soldiers who had hidden on Federal parklands not far from where we filmed, on the Olympic Peninsula.</p><p>The second documentary is called <i>Hidden Heroes</i>. That one I believe is hard to find. </p><p>And then I also really valued so much the work of a filmmaker called Michael Grigsby. He did a beautiful film about the lives of soldiers, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/we-went-to-war/\"><i>We Went to War</i></a> [a sequel to his 1970 documentary <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/i-was-a-soldier-1970/\"><i>I Was a Soldier</i></a>]. So those films were very influential. </p><p><b>Finally, tell us about some of the films that you return to again and again because they feed something in you. </b></p><p>Werner Herzog’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/stroszek/\"><i>Stroszek</i></a>. Lukas Moodysson’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/show-me-love/\"><i>Fucking Åmål/Show Me Love</i></a>. I love the way parents are portrayed in that film. I love the depiction of high school, of not knowing who you’re going to love and how that might happen. I love the conflicts in there and the incremental changes. It’s just a very rich kind of social realism for me. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/celine-sciamma/\">Céline Sciamma</a>’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/girlhood-2014/\"><i>Girlhood</i></a>. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/aki-kaurismaki/\">Aki Kaurismäki</a>’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-other-side-of-hope/\"><i>The Other Side of Hope</i></a>.</p><p>For social realism in the US, something that I’ve been looking at a lot were the films that were in the 40s that dealt with realistic looks at financial crisis, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/william-a-wellman/decade/1940s/\">the films of William Wellman</a>. And then I would say also <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/saturday-night-and-sunday-morning/\"><i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i></a>, a British kitchen-sink film. That’s produced by Tony Richardson [director: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/karel-reisz/\">Karel Reisz</a>]. And one more, in honor of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ermanno-olmi/\">Ermanno Olmi</a>: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/il-posto/\"><i>Il Posto</i></a>.</p><p>Leave No Trace<i> is out in US cinemas 29 June 2018. Our thanks to producer Linda Reisman, Miranda Harcourt, and the team at </i><a href=\"https://falcoink.com/\">Falco Ink</a><i> for interview arrangements.</i></p>"

I don’t think so.” —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/jason_alley/film/sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band/\">Jason Alley</a></p></blockquote><p>Also on the list: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/justin-bieber-never-say-never/\">the Biebs</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hannah-montana-the-movie/\">Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/one-direction-this-is-us/\">One Direction</a>, all of the <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/high-school-musical/\">High School Musical</a></i> movies, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-talking-cat/\">a talking cat</a>, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/birdemic-shock-and-terror/\">attack eagles</a>.</p><p>For balance, and because it didn’t take all that long to do the first list (and nobody brought us cake in the meantime) we also computed <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/most-divisive-all-time-min-10000-ratings/\">the 100 most divisive films rated by at least 10,000 members</a>. In other words, a set of more popular films that have you completely divided. <br/></p><!--figure[2]--><p>It’s really no surprise that Tommy Wiseau’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-room/\">The Room</a> </i>topped this list. It’s a perennial favorite audience-splitter. All the <i>High School Musicals </i>are here, too, along with the <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/twilight-2008/\">Twilight</a> </i>and<i> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey/\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></i> series, the entire <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/transformers/\">Transformers</a> </i>franchise and many, many Adam Sandler vehicles. </p><p>Also of note:</p><ul><li>The most divisive superhero and comic book adaptations are: <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i>, <i>Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman</i> and <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i> (Andrew Garfield’s second spandex outing).</li><li>Multiple appearances by directors Michael Bay (<i>Transformers</i>), Peter Jackson (<i>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, The Lovely Bones</i>), and actor Hugh Jackman (<i>Wolverine, The Greatest Showman, Les Misérables</i>).</li></ul><p>And something else we noticed: several movies that are known for being super popular among viewers who identify as women—<i>The Notebook</i>, <i>Magic Mike XXL</i>, the recent <i>Ghostbusters</i> reboot and Baz Luhrmann’s joyous <i>Moulin Rouge!</i>—made the list. Gender bias has long been known to affect the reception of films targeted for a female audience (there was that time Jane Campion’s <i>In The Cut </i>got an F from CinemaScore). We suspect that if we took Letterboxd members who use the “he/him” pronoun out of the equation, many of those films might slip off the divisive list. </p><p>On that note, we did a cross-check with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/most-fans-on-letterboxd-with-pronoun-she/\">this list</a> of films with most fans on Letterboxd (where “fan” means a member who has the film as one of their four favorites). Our theory checks out, for <i>Moulin Rouge!</i> at least: the musical is ranked 36th out of the 100 films with the most fans on Letterboxd with the “she/her” pronoun, and was your seventh favorite musical in this week’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/the-sound-of-music/\">Showdown</a>.<br/></p><p>So we’ll leave you with this: the greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.<br/></p><!--figure[3]-->"

And the three of us just starting laughing about the premise of who that could be and what that could be. It was a feminist film. It was 1979. It was a woman who does not walk down the aisle, but decks the guy at the alter.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><b>On the sexism she faced as a producer on the film:<br/></b>I was 29, I was one producer and Charles was a producer, he had worked as an assistant director so he had set experience. I didn’t have any experience, and neither did Harvey Miller, the other producer, but they put in my contract that I was not permitted to be on the set by myself. One of the other producers had to be there. Because why? I’m not sure. Because it was a different time. Now people at 29 are directing <i>Star Wars</i>. Or <i>Jurassic Park</i> or whatever. But then, I guess I seemed young, I was female. They probably thought I was [just] Charles’s girlfriend. It was pretty funny. I didn’t take it very seriously but it was in my contract. It’s horrifying when you think about it. But here’s the good news—here I am, where are they?</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>On comedy versus drama:<br/></b>Jack [Nicholson] said to me when we were doing <i>Something’s Gotta Give</i>, he was between takes and he was mopping his brow and I said “What’s the problem?” and he said “Comedy’s so hard!” And the reason it’s so hard is because you have to get it right. Because we all know if it’s not funny, because you’re not laughing. In a big dramatic scene in a dramatic film, if an actor’s not completely spot-on, it’s still a pretty good scene. And I don’t think you’re judging the acting so much [in comedy]—you’re either laughing or you’re not.</p><p><b>On collaborating with Diane Keaton, with whom she worked on four films:<br/></b>One of the great things about Diane is she can do everything. You’ve seen her in dramas like [Warren Beatty’s] <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/reds/\"><i>Reds</i></a> (1981), where she’s brilliant, but she’s also, she’s just naturally insanely funny, like Goldie is. They’re just funny women. There were times when we were making <i>Something’s Gotta Give</i>, and she would say exactly what I wrote, but she just had such an original way of saying things. She’s got some kind of comedy gene. It’s a thing she can do that a lot of people copy and they still can’t do it. She’s off-centre. Before a scene, sometimes she’ll spin to get herself off balance and then she’s ready to go. She doesn’t want to be exactly what you expect.</p><p><b>On the importance of architecture in her movies, many of which take place in very nice houses:<br/></b>My movies get too much attention about how they look so I’m happy that we’re approaching it from the angle of why they look a certain way. To me it’s completely about character, like Diane’s house in <i>Something’s Gotta Give</i>. I had to draw it out because they were stuck in this house for so long—this room had to be here, that room had to be there, there’s a scene where they meet in the middle. So how it plays out is one thing. And I wanted that house to look like a decorator did it, because I wanted it to look like she had just made money from this Broadway show that she had written.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>On striking out on her own following her split with longtime creative collaborator and life-partner Charles Shyer:<br/></b>I’d written with my husband for eighteen years and then we broke up and if you’ve seen any of my movies you know that [divorce], somehow that turned into a lot of work for me. Because it’s what I was thinking about. I was a little nervous in the beginning. My first job without Charles was a re-write, because I wasn’t really ready to make a movie and I didn’t have an original idea. So I did a re-write of a script I renamed <i>What Women Want</i> and then I ended up directing it. I liked the original premise—which was not mine—that a chauvinistic man can understand what it’s like to be a woman. And it really gave me a great vehicle to write things I feel about that.</p><p><b>On writing versus directing:<br/></b>It’s really almost a different part of your brain. Sometimes directing is like math. It’s a technical job and it’s an artistic job and combining those two things at the same time is kind of hard. Because when you’re writing, you’re only really using one part of your brain. So the difference is writing is more freeing. It feels more personal. You’re alone. It’s you, the page, your words. It’s your fantasy. Everything’s perfect, the performances are great, the set’s beautiful.</p><p>Then you go into reality [to direct]. Can’t afford that. Can’t get that restaurant. That actress said no. It’s kind of like going through a maze because you just keep hitting walls. I think one of the reasons I have lasted this long is because I’m very strong-willed. I will just hammer away at something to get it the way I see it. So directing is a lot of negotiating. There are big highs to it.</p>"

And that’s just one of the travails of daily life on a movie set. A movie set is: they’re just trying to freak you out every day. The actor is sick. It’s going to rain today. You shoot a very delicate scene and then the actor goes ‘Oh fuck, we did that last set-up with the keys in my right hand and the other shot I had them in my left hand’. It’s always something. So it’s really a great job, but it’s hideous.</p><p><b>On working with Jack Nicholson on <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/about-schmidt/\">About Schmidt</a></i>:<br/></b>“He made me a better director because he is so good that he will do exactly what you say. It’s like a Ferrari or something. There’s a lot of pressure when you’re a director to, first of all, figure out what you want, if there’s something you want, and the right thing to say. And often you can’t think of the brilliant thing to say—the act-able verb. But anyway, I would say something to him with what I thought was some degree of precision, and he would do exactly that and during the take I would realise that I had misspoken. I had steered it a little bit too far. And I would have to say ‘Mr Nicholson, I know I said X but actually could you make it a little bit more Y’. ‘Oh, sure kid.’</p><p>“Before directing him I rang Mike Nichols up—Mike Nichols had been kind enough to reach out to me after <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/election/\">Election</a></i> to make my acquaintance in that lovely collegial, older director/younger director way, to say ‘Hey, good movie’, so when I would come to New York we might have breakfast or lunch together, once or twice a year for years—so anyway, I called up Mr Nichols and I said ‘You have directed Jack Nicholson thrice, what advice would you have for me?’ And he said ‘Oh it’s very simple, just tell him the truth, because he’s gonna smell it on you anyway’. And I thought that to be pretty good advice, not just for a great like [Nicholson], but pretty much for anybody.”</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>On whether or not he would acknowledge the current American political quagmire if he made the Midwest-set <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nebraska/\">Nebraska</a></i> (2013) today:<br/></b>“When you make a film, speaking for myself, certainly when I was shooting <i>Nebraska</i>, even if I had kept the screenplay exactly the same, and you shoot it any time in history, if you’re open as a director, you cannot help but have the winds of history blowing through you and the film set in the moment you’re making it.</p><p>“So in some way or another—and I do not know how—all I know is that I would recognize it if I could and welcome it to give specificity. It’s a corny thing to say, but when you turn on a camera, you’re putting time in a bottle. And not just that time in front of you, but all the molecules of history floating around in that moment that are wafting by you. So somehow it would show up. I don’t know exactly how.”</p><p><b>On how he decides on an idea or a theme for a script:<br/></b>“That old cliché is true, so forgive me for repeating a corny line: I always think I choose a script but somehow it chooses me, they choose me. I wish it happened more quickly. I’m 57-years-old and have directed only seven feature films. I wish it were more. It’s the damn screenplay that I find the slowest part of the process. On the one hand, I wish I were making a film all the time, on the other hand, I also wanna speak only when I have something to say. But I’m just open. </p><p>“My number one job is I’m searching around reading books, articles, screenplays, getting ideas. I made a movie called <i>Election</i> twenty years ago. The last thing in the world I wanted to do was a high-school picture. They had a tonne of high-school pictures in the late ’90s—God no! And then finally I read that [Tom Perrota] novel and I found that I wanted to do a high-school movie.”</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>On being seen as a Nebraska-obsessed filmmaker:<br/></b>“It&rsquo;s a funny thing, I get the question a lot: why do you like to shoot in Omaha, why do you like to shoot in Nebraska? And my stock stupid answer is: Well, you don’t ask Spike Lee or Martin Scorsese why they like to shoot in New York, and you don’t ask Paul Thomas Anderson or Quentin Tarantino why they like to shoot in Los Angeles—it’s just where you’re from. And somehow writers early in their career like to use where they grew up as fodder, and for me, it’s something that I can both grasp, the behavior I can recreate with some degree of verisimilitude and at the same time it’s something infinitely mysterious that you can never grasp. It’s this ring that’s forever out of your reach, trying to unlock those smells from your childhood.”</p><p><b>On breaking into the industry:<br/></b>“If you wanna make a movie, spend $3,000 and buy a great camera and an AVID for your computer, or Final Cut. The means of production are so accessible now, and even distribution, with YouTube. One has no excuse not to be doing it. The key is not to look for permission from others to do it, but merely to do it yourself at whatever level you currently find yourself.”</p>"

Brettkelly’s portrait is an intimate and illuminating journey into the rarely explored world of high-end Chinese fashion design. The lush aesthetics of Guo Pei’s sartorial expression are easily matched by the film itself, a beautiful, relentlessly uplifting portrait of a creative force whose pure artistry simply demands to be recognized.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>Melissa B. Miller-Costanzo—<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/all-these-small-moments/\">All These Small Moments<br/></a></i></b><i>Spotlight Narrative</i></p><p>Occasionally coming across as a more grounded take on Noah Baumbach’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-squid-and-the-whale/\">The Squid and the Whale</a></i>, writer/director Miller-Costanzo&rsquo;s feature-length directorial debut is a well observed portrait of the enormity of teenage angst. Brendan Meyer (<i>The OA, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-guest-2014/\">The Guest</a></i>) plays a New York high schooler obsessed with the alluring blonde (<i>Girls</i>’ Jemima Kirke) he gawks at on the bus every morning. His angst is amplified by the fact that his parents (Molly Ringwald and Brian D’Arcy James, both emphasizing flawed humanity) increasingly appear headed for divorce. The amusingly awkward Meyer is a welcome guileless alternative to the overly articulate teens that pepper modern cinema. Playing his classmate/fellow misfit, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/harley-quinn-smith/\">Harley Quinn Smith</a> (daughter of filmmaker Kevin Smith) proves emphatically she has something interesting to offer the acting world. Bodes extremely well for Miller-Costanzo’s future filmography.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>Meredith Danluck—<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/state-like-sleep/\">State Like Sleep<br/></a></i></b><i>US Narrative Competition</i></p><p>Meredith Danluck’s neo-noir is set in a location heretofore almost entirely unexplored in the world of thriller cinema: Belgium. It embraces the setting’s other-ness to create a splendidly unsettling film. Katherine Waterston—who recently graduated to blockbuster status with lead roles in <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/alien-covenant/\">Alien: Covenant</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them/\">Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them</a>—</i>ably takes the focus of practically every shot in <i>State Like Sleep</i> as an American photographer dealing with the lingering consequences of the unexplained shooting death of her famous actor husband, played by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/michiel-huisman/\">Michiel Huisman</a> (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-invitation-2015/\">The Invitation</a>, Game of Thrones</i>). This entails interactions with a skeezy underground club owner played by Luke Evans (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/\">The Hobbit</a></i>) and a travelling businessman played with laconic charm by the always-remarkable Michael Shannon (<i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shape-of-water/\">The Shape of Water</a></i>). The film’s woozy charms very much live up to its title.</p>"

Thanks, I love your work! —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/harmanb074/\">Ben</a></b></p><p>Thank you Ben! Well. I would say that aesthetically there should be no difference because, coming back to my original point, one’s aim should be to make something look beautiful and not really concede in any way to the fact that you are shooting animation.</p><p>But there are some issues. Primarily of course the size of what you’re shooting—and this means that relative to the characters you’re shooting, the camera is very, very large. The camera is kind of the size of a small car inside a domestic environment. It’s normally as tall as the character, so you do have issues lighting the character without the camera getting in way. You also have enormous issues with depth of focus because normally we are working right up to the minimum [focal point] of the lens. So to get stuff looking natural, you have to work at a very tiny aperture to get the depth of field that you’d find acceptable in live action.</p><p>A puppet’s head might only be the size of the top of my thumb and if I focus on its eye I might find that its nose and ears are unacceptably out of focus. So we are really asking the lenses to do something they were never really designed to do well, which is to work at tiny stops. Most lenses are optimized around ƒ/4, ƒ/5, ƒ/6 and we typically use them around ƒ/14. We really do beat them into submission.</p><p>The other issue is heat, of course. We don’t want to be cooking the animators or the puppets or the environments. Luckily, we don’t need a huge amount of intensity with light because we can vary our shutter speed, because we are taking shots one frame at a time. But we do need to keep sets comfortable. We do occasionally use large lights—especially if we’re shooting daylight exteriors—because you very quickly give away that they’re models [if] the shadows fan out, and real shadows don’t do that. They remain parallel, or “coherent” as we call it.</p><p><b>Has LED lighting changed DOP work for stop motion? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/visual-effects/tim-capper/\">Tim</a></b></p><p>Yes, LED has in many ways transformed our world. The reason being that it’s very tiny so you can hide it and it’s very cool so it doesn’t produce any heat, and also you can dim it without the colour changing.</p><p>As an example, on <i>Isle of Dogs</i> we have a large theater set which is all painted with red and black lacquer in the Japanese style and it is lit by paper lanterns (which are actually made out of painted resin). Each of those lanterns contains a very small incandescent bulb, so when you dim those the colour gets very warm and orange. But then we have other [LED] fixtures in that environment and they can be dimmed right down but their colour doesn’t change, so you can keep a very dim but pure light point and that makes the warm stuff read warmer. It’s all about showing the eye where the light is. LEDs just have that purity of colour which doesn’t change with intensity.</p><p>And the other thing I wanted to say is the main difference is the sheer number of units we’re shooting on. We typically run between 40 and 50 units, and I’m having to be across all of those in terms of how the film looks. So I’m personally hands-on lighting a lot of those but I can’t do all of them. I have a couple of other guys who help me out and they work to my brief so that it looks like one person did it.</p><p>It is a huge, very busy environment in a very large stage with a lot of people running around. I think people’s impression of animation is a very ponderous, dull thing but actually, although it takes a long time, they’re working as quickly as they can. And they’re all working on their own.</p><!--figure[3]--><p><b>What type of personality do you think you need to work in stop motion? There’s a stereotype that you must have to be very patient, but the reality is quite different?</b></p><p>I think the idea of “patience” is&hellip; I don’t even know where that comes from. That is what we call one of the “top five questions”. That, along with “tell us what is one of the most difficult things you had to do on the film” and “what is Wes Anderson like?”.</p><p>I don’t know what anyone’s being patient about, really. Where’s the patience? An animator is animating. He (or she) is working as fast as he possibly can, doing a very complicated performance through the medium of a puppet. So he is undergoing a degree of concentration it would be impossible to imagine and around him sets are being built, painted, lit, set up.</p><p>In all respects it is exactly like a live action department—it’s very busy, there is no downtime. So this concept of patience is entirely erroneous. What you actually need is stamina. Not patience. Because this is five or six days a week, 60-hour weeks for two years. And it’s intensely busy. Because of the length of time it takes to shoot, we’re in a rolling process of pre-production even when we’re in production. People are constantly losing their temper and constantly screaming and running out of the studio. To think there’s some kind of monkish, trappist environment… [shakes head].</p><p><b>Which villain did you find more terrifying from the films you worked on? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/m_magallon/\">Manny</a></b></p><p>They’re not that scary are they, because they’re puppets, but I guess the best villain is Feathers McGraw from <i>The Wrong Trousers</i>, because it’s a penguin and it never speaks, and yet it has a sense of menace to it that is so thorough. It hasn’t even got pupils! It does occasionally blink but it mostly just sits there and&hellip; <i>looks</i>. It’s amazing how well it works.</p><p>What is it about penguins in animation? There are so many… <i>Surf’s Up</i>. <i>Madagascar</i>. <i>Pingu</i>…</p><!--figure[4]--><p><b>When stop motion films were first shot digitally, sensor noise was an issue that sometimes led to ‘crawling’ artefacts between frames. Has this been mitigated in newer camera hardware, or is it something you still need to watch out for? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/matthew/\">Matthew</a></b></p><p>Do you know what? I read that question and I thought “I have no idea what you’re talking about!” I’m completely unaware of this as an issue. The only film I think that may have been an issue on was <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/corpse-bride/\"><i>Corpse Bride</i></a>. We did have issues with the 5D which was used as the default animation camera for about ten years. But those issues were to do with the chip heating up and causing fluctuations with the density and the contrast. But the camera I used for <i>Isle of Dogs</i> and also Aardman used for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/early-man/\"><i>Early Man</i></a>, which is the Canon 1D X, was pretty damn good. Pretty stable. So it’s kind of ironed out. I mean, you know, no camera on earth is designed to shoot stop-motion animation. I mean why would it be? So we’re always looking for the next camera.</p><p>I know that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/pete-kozachik/\">Pete Kozachik</a> is an extreme fan of 30- to 40-second shutter speeds, which is frankly ludicrous. That may have resulted in excessive sensor noise, but that’s more to do with the shutter speed.</p><p><b>How do you handle having to start an insanely complex shot again after an error?</b></p><p>That’s a very interesting question and I’ll tell you why: because the only reason that we reshoot is if there’s an animation problem. Because nothing gets shot until everything is right. So everything is tested. The lighting, the motion control, set dressing, everything is run in front of the director to the point where they say yes, good to go.</p><p>The reason is: you can’t ask an animator to reshoot a shot if they’ve done nothing wrong because you’ve cocked it up. So only animation issues are reshot. And from that point of view, it doesn’t bother me in the least, because I just go in and make sure they’re good to go, and they just go again. It’s their loss of time, not my loss of time. They’re normally quite okay about it. Most animators don’t mind having a second go because it does give them the opportunity to improve.</p><p>If there’s a catastrophic tech error on the other hand… We did have a flood on <i>Isle of Dogs</i>. We had a massive hole in the roof and a torrential thunderstorm and we lost some stuff in that way. So that becomes an Act of God, a force majeure, and you just have to get on with it.</p><p>But also we do monitor what’s going on, so I tend to pop in and just make sure the animators are okay and do my daily rounds. If I see an animator has unwittingly missed a focus point or position because they hadn’t been concentrating, I would inform the first [assistant director] and say “we need to restart this shot”. But because of the critical mass of shooting on 40 to 50 units, if you have an issue, it’s not really an issue. It can be frustrating, that’s all.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><b>What, if anything, do you miss about the 35mm <i>Chicken Run</i> and <i>Curse of the Were-Rabbit</i> days?</b></p><p>There are things I miss about 35mm days. The structure of the day is far more coherent when you’re shooting on film, because you start your day looking at the rushes, looking at the dailies, then you go into the edit suite and you look at that material cut in, and then you go to the studio floor and address what needs addressing. Whereas when shooting digitally, every time someone finishes a shot you all have to go and look at it, get them turned over, and so on.</p><p>There is also far less downtime for animators and bizarrely I think they suffer from that because the process of sitting down and discussing shots and comparing notes is over. The experience of sitting in a green room and getting into a conversation with two or three old silverbacks of the industry is gone really.</p><p>The other thing is it’s no quicker shooting digitally. We shot <i>Chicken Run</i> in 78 weeks and we shot <i>Isle of Dog</i>s in 86 weeks, so it actually took longer.</p><p>A problem you get with digital is you suddenly have far too much choice. We would do everything in-camera on film. We would use painted backdrops for skies. Everything would be shot into camera, and now of course you can just shoot green screen and decide what your background’s going to look like later.</p><p>You’re giving yourself way too much choice because you can. So the amount of creative decision-making is thrown to the end of the movie. That seems like liberation but in fact it’s just putting off what could otherwise be a perfectly reasonable decision. And I think living with what you’ve done isn’t a bad way of working.</p><p>And the other thing—which has nothing to do with the practicalities of shooting—which appals me, is that every time we do a movie you have to buy new cameras, because they wear out, so they have a life, and they always stop manufacturing the damn things.</p><p>Halfway through<i> Isle of Dogs</i> they stopped making the camera we were shooting on! We had 50 and we had to find another 30 and we had to scour the world for them because Canon was no longer manufacturing them.</p><p>Whereas at Aardman, I could take a camera off the shelf that was made in 1928 and I’d know that I was using a piece of 70- or 80-year-old technology that was just going to keep going. We did not lose a shot on <i>Curse of the Were-Rabbit</i> or <i>Chicken Run</i> to a camera problem.</p><p>We have had far more problems shooting on a 5D than we ever did on film. The sheer absurdity of the throwaway society and obsolescence leaves a bad taste in the mouth. That at the beginning of every movie you have to spend $300,000–400,000 on new cameras.</p><p>At the end all those cameras are [sold on] eBay. The sheer fact of having to put all those cameras on eBay is absurd.</p><!--figure[6]--><p><b>Can you tell us any good stories about the train-chase scene in <i>The Wrong Trousers</i>? (<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/georgiap_15/\">Emma</a> guesses it must be the most challenging scene you’ve ever worked on, and there’s no doubt it is <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/understanding-action-wallace-gromit/\">one of the best action scenes in a film</a>, ever.)</b></p><p>Ha! Do you know how long ago that was? My daughter Sally was born the second week of shooting <i>The Wrong Trousers</i> and she’s just had her 26th birthday. However, I can tell you exactly about the train chase because it was a lot of fun, that particular segment.</p><p>So what you have, of course, is you have this chase that appears to take place in an infinitely huge environment, because the train is moving. We did some crude math and decided the train would be moving at 50mph if it was scaled up. So we did some tests and it looked really slow. So we just kept going up and up and up. And in fact it’s now moving at about 200mph scale-to-scale.</p><p>It’s tiny, absolutely minute, the train. We devised this method for shooting where you never see both ends of the train at the same time, so it’s either being pushed or it’s being pulled. It’s attached to the camera, [which is] on a crane hanging over the set. And the camera either had a rod that was pushing or a thread that was pulling. There is no motion control at all.</p><p>Laid on the floor is a tape measure and a pointer pointing at the tape measure. We’d hit the camera button—it had a two-second exposure—and we’d push the train 10cm [3.9in] along the track. So it’s moving at 10cm a frame. That’s a lot of distance to cover. And as the train is pulled or pushed, its wheels naturally go around on the track, so it self-animates its own spinning wheels as it goes along.</p><p>And we had a set that was a sort of long living room. It was Wallace’s living room but stretched, so it was about five meters long. At one end there was this huge sofa and the camera would go along following the train and it would go behind the sofa and as soon as it moved we’d pick the sofa up and take it down the other end of the set and the camera would move around the sofa and the train would keep going again.</p><p>And then when the penguin flies through the air, we actually mounted a sheet of glass in front of the camera—a big sheet of glass so you could see the set through it—and then the penguin was animated across that sheet of glass from right to left. So it looked like it was flying through the air, but the camera was still moving—everything was moving at 10cm a frame—so that’s 2.4 meters per second on double-0 gauge (if you know anything about trains). If you scale that up you’re moving at a hell of a lick!</p><p><b>So the penguin is stuck to the sheet of glass each time he is moved?</b></p><p>He’s had his back sliced off him so he’s like half a penguin, a bas-relief, if you like.</p><p>Then there are two other bits on that sequence. (It’s a very big sequence, obviously, there’s a lot to tell!) One is when the train goes around the corner. So for that I built this tiny dolly, which was a wedge of timber with four furniture casters on it and a massive Mitchell camera mounted on top of it. The track went under the camera, and I actually knelt on the set and hand dollied it round the bend.</p><p>I thought “this is fantastic!”. But when we actually shot it, what I had completely neglected to register is that as you hit the button the shutter goes around and it completely obscures the eye-piece—so I did it blind, really.</p><p>And the other shot is where the camera goes under the table. I can’t actually remember how we did that. I think we had a table that just broke away. But it’s all in-camera. There are no special effects at all.</p><p>We had a crew of six on that film. And only 150 shots in the whole movie. It’s amazing. The camera just sits there and watches what’s going on. It doesn’t cut, cut, cut. The camera sits there and you watch the whole sequence of penguin looking up at museum and all the other scenes.</p><!--figure[7]--><p><b>Did you have a favorite moment on <i>Isle of Dogs</i>?</b></p><p>[Laughing] The last day! There are certain bits of <i>Isle of Dogs</i> that I greatly enjoyed bringing to the screen, but overall it was a slog. Working with a director who is an auteur gives you far less scope to exercise your own creative imagination, so you become reactive rather than proactive. That can be frustrating. That isn’t saying that the film isn’t fabulous and everyone will love it, but in terms of saying I loved that and I did that, it isn’t really my work. It’s something that I “enabled”, if you will.</p><p>There are some things that give you a degree of satisfaction. The problem with these movies is they are vast machines that roll on, so the intense personal satisfaction that I used to derive from shooting stuff like <i>The Wrong Trousers</i> is kinda lacking, because it’s such a huge thing.</p><p>I had a lot of fun shooting <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/paranorman/\"><i>ParaNorman</i></a>. By my own admission, I think I made a really, really good job of it and I think it looks fantastic. I enjoyed the directors, I enjoyed working at <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/studio/laika-entertainment/\">Laika</a>. It was great.</p><p><b>What are five films you love for their cinematography?</b></p><p>I love Conrad Hall so I would always have <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/road-to-perdition/\"><i>Road to Perdition</i></a>, his last movie, which I think is absolutely stunning. The beauty of shooting that film, dying and then getting a posthumous Academy Award is fantastic.</p><p>Seamus McGarvey is a great talent and I think <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/atonement/\"><i>Atonement</i></a> is a beautiful looking film.</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/casablanca/\"><i>Casablanca</i></a> is absolutely beautiful in black and white. That’s an astonishing looking movie. God, absolutely stunning.</p><p>I just think the standard of cinematography is so high at the moment. Production values just generally are so much better than they were 20 years ago—you can see a lot of bad movies but they’re very rarely badly shot.</p><p>The latest <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner-2049/\"><i>Blade Runner</i></a> is fantastic. I’m so glad Roger [Deakins] won an award for that. R<i>evolutionary Road</i>, he did a fantastic job on that as well.</p><p><b>Any women cinematographers you have an eye on?</b></p><p>I realise that’s a prod, but <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mudbound/\"><i>Mudbound</i></a> is a very handsome looking movie. I think [Rachel Morrison] did a fantastic job on <i>Mudbound</i>. Ask me in another ten years and I’m sure I’ll have many more names.</p><p><b>Did you ever meet Roger Deakins?</b></p><p>No, never. I met <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/jack-cardiff/\">Jack Cardiff</a> a couple of times, in his 90s. He was very twinkly. He’s a very naughty man—I think he had sex with nearly every leading woman that he worked with, which given that he is about five foot four is astonishing. He wrote a fantastic book called Magic Hour which has some absolutely awesome anecdotes in it. It’s well worth a read.</p><p><b>Could you have imagined in your wildest dreams that you’d spend a quarter of a century working in this field?</b></p><!--figure[8]--><p>My wildest dreams? Like some hideous nightmare! I mean, “no” is the answer. I think I’ve always kind of felt that I would be getting out of it at some point. You very rapidly become pigeonholed in this business. Because it’s what I do, it’s what I get asked to do. People are ludicrously conservative about this.</p><p>A case in point is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/loving-vincent/\"><i>Loving Vincent</i></a>. The reason I got that job was because I knew about animation. But I actually shot a 90-minute, single-camera, live-action movie with a dolly, cranes, the works, in 16 days, which is pretty good going for a 90-minute movie. Then someone took it away and whilst I was shooting <i>Isle of Dogs</i> they painted all over it!</p><p>But isn’t it weird that I got the job because I knew about animation? That’s what the business is like—a crazy, slightly blinkered view. But all my films get seen by a lot of people. They’re proper big movies, they go all over the world.</p><p><b>What memories spring to mind when you think about <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/another-country/\"><i>Another Country</i></a> all these years later? It must feel like another life.</b></p><p>Ha! 35 years later. The thing about that movie is that’s kind of what made me do what I do today. I didn’t really know anything about films until I did that movie, and I became very friendly with the camera crew [director of photography <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/cinematography/peter-biziou/\">Peter Biziou</a>, who later won an Academy Award for <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mississippi-burning/\"><i>Mississippi Burning</i></a>, and camera operator David Garfath, who also worked on <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>]. I was really interested in it.</p><!--figure[9]--><p>At secondary school I had done my exams in physics, biology and chemistry so I had a technical knowledge. I absolutely adored acting. I really, really, really enjoyed acting, but it just never happened for me. I had at one point to make a decision about whether I was going to live in a tiny flat by the seaside and do a couple of commercials and a pantomime every year and end up in a blazer and cravat, or do something that would make me a living. So I did spend a couple of schizophrenic years being a clapper loader and an actor, then I went to film school.</p><p>But my memories of that film are very intense and very fond. I mean, that was a real eye-opener for me. I’d never been in that environment before, surrounded by those sorts of people doing that job. It was deeply affecting. I think it damaged me for about five years. Although it was only a few weeks of my life, I then had to go back and finish my degree and the phone never rang. Everyone was interested in Rupert [Everett] and Colin [Firth], or Cary [Elwes]. Although only Colin really became a superstar.</p><p>In hindsight I’d have got myself a publicity agent and gone out there and sold myself. So I do this now. I lead a life of anonymity.</p><p>Look at an animated feature: in terms of awards, all it’ll be up for is best animated feature. The <a href=\"https://annieawards.org/\">Annies</a> don’t ever have a category for cinematography, and they have a category for everything, even an award for the floor sweeper! I wrote to them and asked them in the nicest possible way, why don’t you have a category for cinematography? And they went, ‘Oh it’s far too expensive to introduce new categories’. Then a year later they introduced two new categories. It’s absolutely absurd. We go very unconsidered in this world. Trying to gain membership of any professional organisation is impossible.</p><p>I’ve shot six movies and every one has been nominated or won an Academy Award. And I’ve shot short movies that have won or been nominated. They just go, ‘Yeah, it’s animation though isn’t it’.</p><p><b><b>Well, what keeps getting you up in the morning, in terms of what you do?</b>What do you think is the role of storytellers such as yourself and the teams you work with in our society?</b></p><p>Stories are what separate us from the beasts. We are the only animal capable of projecting abstract thoughts into the future or into the past and drawing analogies in that way. I think it’s what makes us human: the ability to tell stories. There’s no <i>anything</i> without story. People ask me what makes a great movie and I go “the script”.</p><p>People love to watch people acting stuff out. It’s peculiar. It’s not something that any other animal does. It’s very deep within us, this need to tell stories. In fact they’ve now decided that the way these neolithic cave illustrations have been structured, with animals with multiple legs, is because when they were lit by candlelight it gave the impression of running. As the candlelight flickered, these things galloped. It’s all about story.</p><p><b>Finally, tell us why we ought to visit Bristol, <a href=\"http://www.aardman.com/\">the home of Aardman Animation</a>?</b></p><p>Why would one visit Bristol?! Well, it has a thriving arts and animation scene. It’s a little bit laid-back. It’s rather like Portland in that respect. If you were in the UK and you wanted a day out I’m sure it’s right up there with Bath. It’s next door to Bath so you could probably do both in a weekend. But the thing about Bristol is it’s so nice, it’s so comfortable, that people used to go there and never leave.</p><p>I’ve experienced this many times because when I was crewing up <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i>—and indeed <i>Isle of Dogs</i>—I asked some of my old crew from Aardman to come and work with me. And they were all incredibly reluctant and it’s only 110 miles away! They were happier to be unemployed in Bristol than come to London, which terrifies them because there’s too many people there. Portland is where young people to go to retire and Bristol is the graveyard of ambition.</p><p><em>Our thanks to Tristan Oliver for his time and energy and to <a href=\"https://www.fox.com/movies/\">Fox</a> for arranging the interview.</em> See the accompanying <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/tristan-oliver-favorite-cinematographers/\">list</a> of favorite cinematographers and the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/tristan-oliver-qa-animation-cinematographer/\">questions thread</a>.</p>"

A journey through Letterboxd reviews reveals why it topped our “ultimate fan” list.</p><p>“This film proves that you don’t need anything to create a pure work of art,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/leowillem/film/as-i-was-moving-ahead-occasionally-i-saw-brief-glimpses-of-beauty/\">Leo</a> declares. “Everything that matters happens in this film,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/capitao134/film/as-i-was-moving-ahead-occasionally-i-saw-brief-glimpses-of-beauty/\">Gabriel</a>. “I consider this a compelling and unique example of what I consider the cinema of poetics,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dylan_potter/film/as-i-was-moving-ahead-occasionally-i-saw-brief-glimpses-of-beauty/\">Dylan</a> opines. “Films that will never reach the mass market but spiritually mean something to people with an inner understanding of themselves, their harmonies and their grip over life.”</p><p>We also enjoyed <a href=\"https://medium.com/@colinedwards/as-i-was-moving-ahead-occasionally-i-saw-brief-glimpses-of-beauty-on-vodka-bab8e577d3de\">this vodka-soaked deep-dive</a> into Mekas’ film by Colin Edwards: “By the final hour, one of our group was rolling around on the floor drooling water all over his sleeping bag from convulsive laughter whilst the cat walked through the kebab sauce and covered my shoes in parma-ham…”</p><p>Elsewhere on the list: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/matrix/\"><i>Matrix</i></a>, from 1973, is an 18-minute experimental art film and its appearance can presumably be chalked up to user error—added instead of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-matrix/\"><i>The Matrix</i></a>—but maybe not?</p><p>Elem Klimov’s 1985 war drama <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/come-and-see/\"><i>Come and See</i></a> must be one of the highest-rated yet least-recommended films on the list (and on Letterboxd itself). “An experience that I can’t recommend as it is unbelievably disturbing,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dirkh/film/come-and-see/\">writes Dirk in his five-star review</a>. “I’d think twice about recommending it to people,” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/genkib/film/come-and-see/\">Genki B agrees</a>, adding, “The imagery is shocking but also kind of amazing. There’s a scene in which you see a Mercedes Benz symbol on the front of a truck and you feel like you could never buy a German-engineered car again.”</p><p>The little-known TV movie <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/front-of-the-class/\"><i>Front of the Class</i></a> gets some love, possibly because—in true made-for-TV, based-on-a-true-story tradition—the story of a man with Tourettes Syndrome who just wants to be a schoolteacher has just enough emotion to surpass the cheese. Or, as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ridleyjones/film/front-of-the-class/\">Carla</a> put it, “Let’s just say a lot of us cried in <i>Front of the Class.</i>”</p><p><i>Call Me by Your Name</i>, high up on the other lists, ranks well here too, which shows how much love we have for that film (and on that note, check out <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/luca-guadagninos-trio-of-films-about-love/\">the trio of films about love</a> that director Luca Guadagnino shared with us).</p><p>Finally, two unreleased 2018 films made the list: Alex Garland’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/annihilation/\"><i>Annihilation</i></a>, which early reviewers are getting excitedly sweary about, and modern romance <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/love-simon/\"><i>Love, Simon</i></a> (coming in at number six—probably due to high anticipation from fans of the book).</p></figure>"

The blue line represents the number of Letterboxd users who marked the film as watched. Green represents those who logged a diary entry, and orange is the number of reviews written.</p><!--figure[1]--><p><!-- more --></p><p>The line segments on the graph are 10 minutes apart, so that peak around 9pm represents a rate of 1,800 actions per hour. Within five hours of that first spike, we’d amassed over 1,600 member reviews of the film.<br/></p><p>To put this in perspective: in the same period, IMDb added just 44 reviews. In the 24 hours following that 9pm spike, Letterboxd members had published 3,572 reviews (comprising 305,705 words)—IMDb added 108 user reviews over the same period. (We are aware this comparison isn’t perhaps entirely fair, as IMDb has a minimum word count and moderates all user reviews, but it makes us proud to be attracting such a high volume of activity when the big releases happen.)</p><p>To make sure we’re doing good math, we decided to pick a comparison film. </p><p>We looked up the stats for another recent big opening: <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-the-last-jedi/\"><i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i></a>. Letterboxd members filed 2,455 reviews for TLJ in the 24-hour period following its US release (December 13).</p><p>So: <i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i> had 3,572 reviews in the first 24 hours versus <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i>’s 2,455. (Yes alright, you didn’t have to leave your laptops, buy a ticket and get to the cinema. But, c’mon—<i>Star Wars</i>.) </p><p>At the time of publication we have <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/reviews/by/added/\">over 4,200 reviews</a> for the film. IMDb has more ratings than us—<a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2548396/\">16,257</a> versus 11,091—but our audience is a little more discerning: you’ve awarded it an average of 2.54 versus IMDb’s 6.0 out of 10 (3.0 equivalent on a 5-star scale).</p><!--figure[2]--><h2>But was it any good?</h2><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thescreenplug/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/\">Will loved it</a>: “This roller coaster of WTF moments that you can’t turn away from. Truly gripping sci-fi at its best. Probably many weird plot holes to be found, but it was completely escapist and captivating and left me engaged enough to ignore/overlook those shortcomings. Great flick.”</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/milo123/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/\">Milo wrote that the film</a> “makes a solid case for why [Gugu Mbatha-Raw] should become more of a big name as she pretty much carries this movie, which [otherwise leaves] too much ambiguity and never answers enough questions for a film that was supposed to tie the Cloverfield universe together.”<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/hammerbros94/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/\">Wesley Ball wasn’t convinced</a>: “The sudden appearance of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/10-cloverfield-lane/\">10 Cloverfield Lane</a></i> two years ago was a very welcome surprise, but this film, in its current state, for all intents and purposes, should not have been allowed out to the public… <i>Cloverfield</i> is one of my favorite found-footage films, with its sequel being a strong follow-up supported by a knockout terrifying performance by John Goodman. But <i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i> has almost nothing going for it, save the unorthodox release method.”</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/duckisgod/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/\">Colin thought the <i>Cloverfield</i> tie-in was a problem</a>: “The cast is great and the concept is brilliant. I’m sure <i>God Particle</i> would have been a great movie by itself, but by making it into a <i>Cloverfield</i> movie ruins the fun of what it could have been… I didn’t hate the movie but I hated that it was tied down by the <i>Cloverfield</i> brand.”</p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kidmannicole/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/\">Ari, a first-time <i>Cloverfield</i> viewer, also loved it:</a> “Black girl magic / black excellence / black love on screen and behind the camera… This is so my brand of science fiction. Give me all the parallel universes, pocket dimensions, and alternate realities. It’s making me want to rewatch <i>Fringe</i>.”</p><p>And <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/spacemadchen/film/the-cloverfield-paradox/\">Caitlin speaks for many of us about the sheer spectacle of the thing</a>: “<i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i> came into my house, slapped me across the face, and made me cry about Higgs Boson and Daniel Brühl.”</p><h2>Our conclusion?</h2><p>Well played, Netflix. This was as eventful as a movie event gets.</p>"

We’re pleased to announce that today we’ve shipped Letterboxd 2.0 for iOS, a universal app with native iPad support that brings the richness of our community to the larger form factor.</p></p><p>This was no small task. Some screens from the phone app just made sense larger (browsing grids of popular films) or presented in a popover (sorting and filtering options), while others (like member profiles) required more of a rethink. The results are glorious—our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/pro/\">Patron</a> profile pages have never looked so good! With three iPad resolutions and two orientations to consider, we’ve concentrated our efforts on the most commonly used views in the app, and we’ll continue to refine ancillary screens in future releases.</p><p>We have good news for split-screen lovers too: the new app supports every intermediate size on all iPads in both orientations, so you can multi-task while you write reviews or browse for something to watch. At the narrowest size the app mimics an iPhone, and our major layouts expand to take advantage of the extra space at the two larger split-screen resolutions.</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>Version 2.0 of the app also adds support for <b>x-callback-url</b>, a standardized way for iOS apps to pass data from one to another. This will enable those who use apps like <a href=\"https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> or <a href=\"https://workflow.is\">Workflow</a> to, for example, automate the creation of reviews as part of a specific action or workflow. There’s even a workflow to log a film from your Apple Watch! Documentation for the methods we’re supporting at launch <a href=\"https://github.com/letterboxd/letterboxd-ios-x-callback-url\">is here</a>.</p><p>We’re immensely proud of our small iOS team for delivering such a polished update, and we know those of you with iPads will love it. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/contact/\">Let us know</a> if you strike any issues, wish to suggest an enhancement or just want to send some love.</p><p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1054271011\"><b>Get Letterboxd for iPhone and iPad in the App Store</b></a></p>"

I loved the character and the comedy, and for some reason, that particular show really stayed with me. The genius of it is that Paddington is the only 3D character in a cardboard cut-out world, which makes you relate far more closely to him than any of the humans, which is quite unusual in the weird-creature-lives-with-a-family sub-genre and goes some way to explaining why he’s such a beloved character.</p><p>I definitely felt the weight of responsibility, not only to all the fans of the character, but especially to Michael Bond. By the time I’d put in my five-year shift on the first film, he’d been writing Paddington stories for 55 years, and I knew he must have been petrified about what we’d done to his beloved bear.</p><p>When the time finally came for him to watch the film, I was so nervous about how he might respond, I couldn’t sit with him. Instead, Rosie Alison, our executive producer (and a far braver person than I) watched it with him while I paced nervously round the block for 95 minutes. When she finally phoned to tell me he’d loved it, I literally doubled over in the street, moaning with relief. After that, I didn’t mind so much what other people thought!</p><p>",

We looked at the colours of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jacques-demy/\">Jacques Demy</a>, the set designs of [photographer] Tim Walker, and the sense of the alien in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-thing/\">Shaun Tan[’s work]</a> to name but a few.</p><p><b>The Paddington films are such a wonderful fan-tribute to the stop-motion <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mClA14WQFu8\">BBC series</a> and Michael Bond’s books, enhancing the artistry and placing Paddington in a perfect “contemporary-vintage” 21st-century context (especially with the current international conversation around refugees, immigration, Brexit, human kindness and what-have-you). That’s really a long-winded way of asking: where did Paddington sit in your childhood and how heavy was the responsibility to get it right?</b></p><p>One of my earliest memories is lying on the living room rug watching Paddington on TV. I loved the character and the comedy, and for some reason, that particular show really stayed with me. The genius of it is that Paddington is the only 3D character in a cardboard cut-out world, which makes you relate far more closely to him than any of the humans, which is quite unusual in the weird-creature-lives-with-a-family sub-genre and goes some way to explaining why he’s such a beloved character.</p><p>I definitely felt the weight of responsibility, not only to all the fans of the character, but especially to Michael Bond. By the time I’d put in my five-year shift on the first film, he’d been writing Paddington stories for 55 years, and I knew he must have been petrified about what we’d done to his beloved bear.</p><p>When the time finally came for him to watch the film, I was so nervous about how he might respond, I couldn’t sit with him. Instead, Rosie Alison, our executive producer (and a far braver person than I) watched it with him while I paced nervously round the block for 95 minutes. When she finally phoned to tell me he’d loved it, I literally doubled over in the street, moaning with relief. After that, I didn’t mind so much what other people thought!</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><b>I was impressed at how the first film generally evaded easy/lazy humor that’s all too common in kids’ films these days. Were there certain films you enjoyed as a child that you sought to emulate? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/j_kashmir/\">Johnny</a></b></p><p>I didn’t particularly set out to emulate any of the films I loved as a child. I find writing comedy so hard there’s pretty much nothing I wouldn’t do for a laugh—but I didn’t want to put any jokes in the film that wouldn’t have felt at home in the Paddington books or TV shows, because I felt it would have broken the tone.</p><p>For every person who would laugh at a fart joke, I suspect another two would have been disappointed. That’s not to say a fart joke can’t be funny (see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blazing-saddles/\"><i>Blazing Saddles</i></a>), but it wouldn’t have been right for Paddington.</p><p><b>Follow-up question: could you name five favorite films you remember from childhood?</b></p><p>My parents aren’t great cinema-goers and we lived in a small village in the middle of nowhere which pretty much meant I wasn’t either. But once I started loving films as a teenager, I devoured everything I could get my hands on. I had a very over-thought top ten which I’ve mostly forgotten. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/brazil/\"><i>Brazil</i></a> was for a long time my favourite film, followed by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/zazie-dans-le-metro/\"><i>Zazie dans le métro</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/taxi-driver/\"><i>Taxi Driver</i></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/delicatessen/\"><i>Delicatessen</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/three-colors-red/\"><i>Three Colours Red</i></a>. What a pompous child.</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><b>Several members wanted to know how you make the films sweet and loveable without veering into saccharine territory. Take us into the room with you and your <i>Paddington 2</i> co-writer Simon Farnaby. What’s your yard-stick for saccharinity measurement, if you will? Is it a bit like the marmalade-making scene in the prison: keep adding sugar until it seems just about right?</b></p><p>The most important job for the director is to keep a sense of the tone, and it’s so easy to get lost. Even <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/billy-wilder/\">Billy Wilder</a> used to have a sign above his desk saying ‘What would <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/ernst-lubitsch/\">Lubitsch</a> do?’ If I were to have a sign above the directing desk for the Paddington films, it would say ‘What would <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/jean-pierre-jeunet/\">Jeunet</a> do?’ I wanted to do for London what <i>Amelie</i> did for Paris, and I love his characters, his amazing camera angles, tracking shots and seemingly boundless inventiveness.</p><p>But in terms of the writing, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/frank-capra/\">Frank Capra</a> was our most frequent reference on <i>Paddington 2</i>. Paddington’s a really hard character to write for, especially in a sequel, as he doesn’t have a classic ‘flaw’ that needs fixing. He’s clumsy and misunderstands things—but you wouldn’t want to change that about him, so while those characteristics can help you through set pieces, they don’t help you come up with a story.</p><p>When Simon and I started thinking about <i>Paddington 2</i>, we tried to think of films where the character is as kind and good-natured as Paddington, and Frank Capra kept coming to mind, especially <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mr-smith-goes-to-washington/\"><i>Mr Smith Goes to Washington</i></a>. Jeff Smith is a pure, innocent, well intentioned soul with old-fashioned values, and the journey of that film is testing whether those values can withstand the cruel, cynical world of Washington.</p><p>Once we started thinking of the film in terms of that sort of shape, as a test of the values Paddington learned from Aunt Lucy both in London and prison, we were able to find a proper character arc—and that in turn generates meaning and emotion.</p><p>That said, we like to find a little joke to undercut too much treacliness or pomposity. I think it’s nice to push the audience to the place where they think things might be about to get cheesy, and then reassure them that they’re still watching a comedy.</p><p><!--figure[4]--></p><p><b>My mom’s face lights up when she watches <i>Paddington</i>, in a way that she never has with any other movie and in a way I can only imagine is similar to her being a little girl again. What do you think it is about Paddington, or your take on him, that makes it a true family film, almost like an equalizer, where every age is simply delighted. Are there other films you find have an ‘equalizing’ effect on audiences? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/beringerhill/\">Shirley</a></b></p><p>One of the things I most love about Chaplin is that I find him as funny now as I did when I was a child. I don’t think any of his jokes are aimed at children or adults; they’re just universally funny (unless you’re dead inside). When we wrote, we just tried to make something that would make us laugh, rather than trying to aim one joke at the kids and the next one at the grown-ups. If we didn’t find it funny, it wasn’t going in.</p><p>I think a lot of the best family entertainment seems to take the same attitude. There’s certainly nothing in many of the Pixar movies that I feel is aimed exclusively at children or grown-ups, nor in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/nick-park/\">Nick Park</a>’s movies, which are a huge influence.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><b>Is food the great unifier? Starting with the humble British marmalade sandwich (which was the undoing of Kidman’s character in the first film), to Paddington’s influence on the prisoners’ food and relationships (‘For Goodness Cake’), and Phoenix’s hatred of his career turning to (or into, if you’re inclined) dog food, how did you and Simon Farnaby arrive at this idea? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/milan/\">Milan</a></b></p><p>I’m not sure where it all comes from. Mind you, they do say ‘write what you know’, and I know eating.</p><p>Phoenix’s dog food commercial just felt like a pretty funny idea for something humiliating for him to have to sell. We wanted the idea that he used to be famous for Shakespeare and is now only known for this terrible jingle. We even had a song he was going to be forced to sing: “No more snuffles, with Mr Wuffles, ’cos it’s the world’s best medicated dog food.”</p><p><b>We note that you’ve worked with Gary Williamson for ages, including on your film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bunny-and-the-bull/\"><i>Bunny and the Bull</i></a>. There are so many wonderful sight gags—how many of those were scripted by you and Simon, versus brought to the table by Gary and his brilliant artists, and the animation team, for that matter? What’s the collaborative flow like at this level? What’s Gary like? He must be hilarious. Please tell us he’s hilarious or at least as lovely as his design is!</b></p><p>Gary is very lovely and very funny. I first met him when he was suggested by Mary Burke, the producer of my first, wildly unsuccessful film, <i>Bunny and the Bull</i>.</p><p>I was immediately attracted to him because he didn’t turn up all sharply dressed. He looked like he’d slept in a hedge. And instead of producing thousands of reference images, he’d done a pencil drawing of the whole film as he saw it. I realised he was the man for me then and there. He worked with the late, great <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/dennis-potter/\">Dennis Potter</a> for years, so knows everything about heightened reality.</p><p>In terms of the in-camera jokes, they’re very laborious. But I love films where you can pause the DVD, read the whole newspaper or letter and get about five jokes you’d miss watching at 24 frames per second. It’s easy enough to spot where they might go, but a lot of work at the last minute when you’re trying to film! Simon helped out a lot but the newspapers in <i>Paddington 2</i> are mostly written by <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/writer/jon-croker/\">Jon Croker</a> who helped out a great deal on both films. <i>[Fun fact: Jon Croker has <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2018/01/paul-mccartneys-high-in-the-clouds-signs-up-the-woman-in-blacks-jon-croker-to-pen-1202238364/\">signed on</a> to write the script for the animated feature version of Sir Paul McCartney’s book </i>High in the Clouds<i>.]</i></p><p><b>Aunt Lucy teaches Paddington some of the most important things in his life—who is <i>your</i> Aunt Lucy? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/debsterbread/\">Debbie</a></b></p><p>My Aunt Lucy is… Aunt Lucy! I’ve spent so long in the world of Paddington she’s become my moral compass.</p><p><b>Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant were both incredibly entertaining in these movies. Are there any other actors you’d like to see as Paddington villains? —<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/yeblod/\">Guy</a></b></p><p>I’d love Javier Bardem to come up against the bear.</p><p><b>Finally, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/antoniathomas/\">Allison</a> speaks for all of us when she asks: when and where can I buy a ‘Free Paddington’ pin?</b></p><p>I don’t know!

Collectively we passed the 100 million films marked watched <a href=\"http://news.letterboxd.com/post/160429464083/100-million\">way back in May</a> and now we’re sailing towards 140 million. You marked more than 51 million films watched in 2017, a 77% increase over 2016. In fact, numbers were up across the board: almost 3.8 million more diary entries; almost a million more reviews written; more than 150,000 more lists created (<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tigerkat/list/harrison-ford-films-ranked-by-how-much-he/\">here’s a favorite involving Harrison Ford and flying vehicles</a>); more inventive community challenges by you; and a brilliant reception to our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/showdown/\">Showdown</a> series.</p><p>We launched our <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.letterboxd.letterboxd&amp;hl=en\">Android app</a> this year, which now sits alongside our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/apps/\">iPhone and Apple TV apps</a> (universal iPad support is being tested by our Patrons, for release early this year).

And we may yet see him as Elio again—Guadagnino has hinted at a sequel (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/22/luca-guadagnino-call-me-by-your-name-step-inside-teenage-dreams\">squeal!</a>).</p><p>We also want to point out that Chalamet is a double winner in our Year in Review, with roles in both the first and second highest-rated films of the year—he plays one of Saoirse Ronan’s love interests in <i>Lady Bird</i>.</p><h2>The return of <i>Twin Peaks</i></h2><p><i>But is it a television series or a film?! </i></p><p>MoMa curator Rajenda Roy has waded into the debate, saying it’s <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/twin-peaks-the-return-theatrical-release-new-york-city-david-lynch-1201909376/\">“simply unclassifiable”</a> but, in giving all 18 hours of <i>Twin Peaks: The Return</i> a theatrical run in the museum’s <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/film/3900?locale=en\">The Contenders</a> program this month, Roy has ensured David Lynch’s cinematic series has a permanent place on Letterboxd.

Very intelligent.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p><strong>We had several great questions—from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/dantehemingway/\">Dante</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/darrencb/\">Darren</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tommywiseaum/\">Marisa</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mangeymaggie/\">MangeyMaggie</a>—all curious about the places and people you choose to film, who are outside of the so-called mainstream, often marginalized. We really like their questions, actually, for how they speak to privilege: both your privilege (white, male) and your position as someone who gets to tell stories. So tell us how you manage to find the balance between an empathetic representation of these specific demographics, and a universally relatable story.</strong></p><p>It’s just a response to what I’m not seeing enough of. It’s very simple. It’s just that the reason that there are marginalized communities and subcultures and groups of people is because they’re ignored, and so the antidote to that is in just stop ignoring. That’s how I see it. It’s as simple as starting to look outside of the groups that normally have stories told about them and for them. It’s really that simple.</p><p>The balance is really just approaching the way you would approach any other story. I mean, this is the way that I would tell a story about anybody. Basically humanizing them, trying to find empathy in our characters. This is just the way I would normally do this to anybody, so I guess that’s how you strike a difference.</p><p>\n</p><p>It’s weird because I’m bad at self-analyzing, but I think what it comes down to is if you’re telling a story about a group of people that you’re not really a part of, I guess the question is why would you approach it in any sort of a different way? If you do do that, you’re basically saying that you consider them different from you. You know what I mean? It’s just as simple as, it feels to me the only ethical way of doing something like this is all about equality, so you approach it the same exact way.</p><p><p>If you’re telling a story about two transgender women of color who happen to be sex workers but the ultimate story, the universal theme in this is friendship, why would you tackle it in any different way?\n</p><!--figure[3]--></p><p><strong>On the ‘male gaze’ and how you work with female characters, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/melcastaneda/\">Melissa</a> asked: “Whenever I talk about works that avoid the male gaze, I like to point out yours. I think you handle perfectly these ‘unconventional’ women and themes that could be hard to represent (like sex workers, transgender women [of color], etc). I wonder if you’re always conscious of how important it is to do it right or if it just comes naturally. How much do you let your actresses take over?”</strong></p><p>\n</p><p>I have to say I am conscious of it. I mean, we’re living in an age of the think-piece, we’re living in an age where people are really looking out for this, in a good way. It’s a good thing.</p><p>\n</p><p>You know, Hollywood for a long time has been blind to this, so when I go into any of these films I have to make sure that in a way I am very conscious of the fact that I’m a guy, I’m a straight guy making these movies, but if I’m focusing on a female protagonist, I have to make sure the representation is correct. And also just in general.</p><p>The gaze is an important thing. I look at the gaze, I really do respect when a director, like a <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/larry-clark-1/\">Larry Clark</a>, has his gaze just plastered all over the film. This is his perspective, this is what he wants to see. That’s great. That’s one thing. But with my films, because they’re sometimes tackling issues and it’s something that has to appeal to an audience that spans, you know, race, gender, creed etc, I have to be a little more middle of the road. And when I’m middle of the road, I have to determine whether I’m falling into too much of the male gaze. My own gaze.</p><p>\n</p><p>So what I try to do is I try to balance it out. And so for example I have to make sure that the camera stays objective, or is equally balanced. So if I’m gonna show female nudity, I’m gonna show male nudity, and that was very important for me, especially with <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/starlet/\"><em>Starlet</em></a>. Because <em>Starlet</em> is focusing on an industry that is all male gaze, when I went about showing that industry I wanted to make sure that it wasn’t falling into that. We’re an outside view of that industry and therefore it should be so much more objective. So I made sure my male nudity was more explicit than female nudity in that film.</p><p>It’s also important because a lot of my characters are female characters, and so the great thing about that is I usually work with actresses who I have a very good relationship with in terms of our communication. I turn to my actresses and ask them their opinions and ask them whether representation is correct here and how they would do it and what they would like to see. Or how the scene is being played out and is this reaction accurate? Is this line believable? So I think there’s a lot of collaboration and a lot of turning to my female actors to help me figure out whether the male gaze is appropriate.</p><p>\n<!--figure[4]--></p><p><strong>There were so many questions about the ending of <em>The Florida Project</em> that it’s safe to say we should ask a question about the ending of <em>The Florida Project</em>. A lot has already been written about why you chose to film the final scene the way you did, but what do you make of all this obsession with the ending?</strong></p><p>\n</p><p>I did not know it was going to be as polarizing as it is. It was one of our first visions that Chris [Bergoch, Sean’s co-writer] and I had, so we’ve been tied to this ending to a certain degree since 2012 or 2011 when we first thought of the idea.</p><p>It’s something that we never wavered from, but at the same time I was a little surprised at how polarizing it has become because if you think of the alternative, what <em>is</em> the alternative? Little Moonee in the back of an ACS car crying and being taken away? Because if that’s what people want they can watch <em>CSI</em> or <em>Law and Order</em> or something!</p><p>It’s obvious what we’re saying. It’s the first time in the movie where there is an actual score. So we’re obviously saying that it might not be real, what they’re watching, but at the same time we really do want to leave it up to interpretation, because the whole movie has been about little Moonee using her sense of imagination and wonderment to make the best of the situation she’s in.</p><p><strong>How does your process with Chris work?</strong></p><p>Chris and I have written the last three films together, and our sensibilities are the same, yet not. He comes heavily influenced by mainstream cinema—meaning Hollywood—Spielberg, Disney, etc. I don’t. I mean I do, but that was when I was seven years old! I think that that is actually a good thing, the fact that we come from opposite sides in terms of how structured sometimes we wanna keep a screenplay. We come to it with different thoughts and we meet somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Chris and I, we have our initial talks on the phone where we do a lot of our initial brainstorming, and then we slowly break it down into a treatment, and then a “scriptment”—which is like half a script, half a treatment—and then the final screenplay.</p><p>There is that research period in which we usually take trips together, if we can, to wherever we have to go in order to do this, but most of the writing actually is done separately. You know, we will choose the scenes that we feel that we have the best hold on—meaning the ones that we feel that we’re confident that we can do on our own—and then we share them. We do a lot of writing online, like Google documents where we just share. It’s very simple.</p><p><!--figure[5]--></p><p><strong>Finally, many Letterboxd folk wanted advice on how to become a filmmaker, how to get experience, how to network, should they make an iPhone feature, can they work for you, and so on.</strong></p><p><strong>Here’s one question from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/leosilvax/\">Leonardo</a> that perhaps might focus you in: What was the most important lesson you had to learn that has had a positive effect on your filmmaking?</strong></p><p>Well, I guess it’s a very “big picture” sort of thing. I think that it has to do with just perseverance. Just continuing to make the film, until eventually it got attention. So I guess the biggest lesson has been just to continue working.</p><p>What I keep telling people is that there’s not going to be anybody who just comes and dumps money in your lap. It doesn’t work that way. You have to prove yourself. You can prove yourself these days with all the tools that are out there. You can use your iPhone. You can use so many platforms now to put films up on.</p><p>I found <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/melamurder/\">Mela Murder</a>, who plays Ashley in the movie, because I was going through Vimeo and watching Staff Picks, and there was that wonderful film called <em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/121159129\">Gang</a></em>. Now I talk about that movie, and Mela, she’s got a great opportunity out of this just because that film was put out there on that platform.</p><p>I just tell people: don’t wait, just do it. You can make films for so little money these days that if for some reason it unfortunately doesn’t go the way you want, it’s not that big of a money loss, it’s not that big of a disaster.</p><p>And then, I guess if there was another lesson… Oh oh oh!</p><p>Don’t <em>ever</em> fall in love on set. It totally ruins everything. It’s so distracting and stupid.</p><p>I learned that on my first film, ’cause I kind of semi fell in love with my assistant director and it really is distracting. You’re only thinking about your movie 50% of the time and you’re thinking of this person the other 50% of the time.</p><p>If you’re about to make a movie, just be a celibate, get it off your mind, and go into those 30 days without any sort of… don’t be tempted! Or go in there already in a relationship, but do not form a new relationship while you’re shooting a film!</p><p><strong>Noted! Thanks, Sean. We would do our best not to fall in love, but it’s too late: Letterboxd loves you.</strong></p><p>I love Letterboxd! I actually didn’t start using it until earlier this year and up till this point I’ve always been writing my films down in a journal, and I stress out because I might lose that journal. So I have to say it’s been wonderful! <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lilfilm/\">I get a lot of followers now who seem to be intrigued with what I’m watching</a>. It’s very cool.</p>"

      "sub_title": "Greta Gerwig—<i>Lady Bird</i>",
      "abstract": "<p>Gerwig’s first film as the sole writer-director, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-bird/\"><i>Lady Bird</i></a> stars Saoirse Ronan as the title character, a spirited Sacramento high schooler who feels destined for greater things on the East Coast (“Lady Bird” is the fanciful name she gives herself; her parents know her as Christine but humor her nevertheless). </p><p>Although <i>Lady Bird</i> features many of the tropes familiar to American high school movies—prom, losing one’s virginity, best friend fights, wrong-side-of-the-tracks class comparisons—they’re handled in a fresh way, a deft balance between comedy and drama. Inspired by, but not directly drawn from, her own upbringing, Gerwig says, “It was a love letter to Sacramento, and I felt like what better way to make a love letter than through somebody who wanted to get out and then realised that they loved it. </p><p>“In a way it’s secretly the mother’s movie as much as it is Lady Bird’s movie. Somebody’s coming of age is somebody else’s letting go. And I was just as interested in the letting go as I was of the young people’s stories.”</p><p>Like many of its coming-of-age predecessors, such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pretty-in-pink/\"><i>Pretty in Pink</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blue-is-the-warmest-color/\"><i>Blue is the Warmest Colour</i></a>, <i>Lady Bird</i> has a strong class narrative running through it; a purposeful inclusion by Gerwig, who greatly admires English filmmaker <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mike-leigh/\">Mike Leigh</a>. </p><p>“Class is a very difficult thing in America,” she says. “We’re uncomfortable with class and how that works but I think it’s something that’s an invisible force that shapes a lot of people’s lives.</p><p>“Life is not fair, and resources are not divided fairly, either in talents or in economics. […] One thing that I wanted to explore is: Lady Bird’s always looking up at other people, and people she thinks have more, and have it all together, and meanwhile those people are looking up at other people. And she doesn’t see how much she has, because in a culture of ‘more more more’ and ‘I always need to get to the next level’, there’s no way that you can appreciate what you have.<br/></p><p>“It’s that disease of always looking up and never being where you are.” </p><p>On the challenge of directing, Gerwig says her acting experiences stood her in good stead: “One of the reasons is that most directors only ever are on their own sets! They don’t actually know how anyone else does it. And I’ve been on a lot of sets, and I’ve seen a lot of different ways of working and a lot of different ways of relating to actors and crew, and I’ve sort of seen what works and what doesn’t work, and I took all these ideas that I’d been gathering over the years. </p><p>“And they could be as little as things like having your crew wear name-tags every day.

      "body": "<p>Gerwig’s first film as the sole writer-director, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-bird/\"><i>Lady Bird</i></a> stars Saoirse Ronan as the title character, a spirited Sacramento high schooler who feels destined for greater things on the East Coast (“Lady Bird” is the fanciful name she gives herself; her parents know her as Christine but humor her nevertheless). </p><p>Although <i>Lady Bird</i> features many of the tropes familiar to American high school movies—prom, losing one’s virginity, best friend fights, wrong-side-of-the-tracks class comparisons—they’re handled in a fresh way, a deft balance between comedy and drama. Inspired by, but not directly drawn from, her own upbringing, Gerwig says, “It was a love letter to Sacramento, and I felt like what better way to make a love letter than through somebody who wanted to get out and then realised that they loved it. </p><p>“In a way it’s secretly the mother’s movie as much as it is Lady Bird’s movie. Somebody’s coming of age is somebody else’s letting go. And I was just as interested in the letting go as I was of the young people’s stories.”</p><p>Like many of its coming-of-age predecessors, such as <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pretty-in-pink/\"><i>Pretty in Pink</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/blue-is-the-warmest-color/\"><i>Blue is the Warmest Colour</i></a>, <i>Lady Bird</i> has a strong class narrative running through it; a purposeful inclusion by Gerwig, who greatly admires English filmmaker <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/director/mike-leigh/\">Mike Leigh</a>. </p><p>“Class is a very difficult thing in America,” she says. “We’re uncomfortable with class and how that works but I think it’s something that’s an invisible force that shapes a lot of people’s lives.</p><p>“Life is not fair, and resources are not divided fairly, either in talents or in economics. […] One thing that I wanted to explore is: Lady Bird’s always looking up at other people, and people she thinks have more, and have it all together, and meanwhile those people are looking up at other people. And she doesn’t see how much she has, because in a culture of ‘more more more’ and ‘I always need to get to the next level’, there’s no way that you can appreciate what you have.<br/></p><p>“It’s that disease of always looking up and never being where you are.” </p><p>On the challenge of directing, Gerwig says her acting experiences stood her in good stead: “One of the reasons is that most directors only ever are on their own sets! They don’t actually know how anyone else does it. And I’ve been on a lot of sets, and I’ve seen a lot of different ways of working and a lot of different ways of relating to actors and crew, and I’ve sort of seen what works and what doesn’t work, and I took all these ideas that I’d been gathering over the years. </p><p>“And they could be as little as things like having your crew wear name-tags every day. Which sounds small, but… if you switch out camera operator and [the actors] don’t know who the new person is, and you know, because you’ve talked to them, but they don’t know. I stole that from Mike Mills on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/20th-century-women/\"><i>20th Century Women</i></a>. So I felt like that was helpful. </p><p>“My greatest joy is working with actors and watching them bring life to these things that I’ve put on the page that are essentially dead until they bring their spirit and their artistry to it. So I adore them, and I think they know that, and I have a lot of empathy for what I’m asking of them. Because I’ve been there. And it’s hard. I try to bring sensitivity to it.” </p><p>FYI: <i>Lady Bird</i> <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/lady-birds-opening-weekend-breaks-box-office-records-1820175928?rev=1509978705609&amp;utm_campaign=socialfow_jezebel_twitter&amp;utm_source=jezebel_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">broke American box office records</a> on its opening weekend.</p><p><!-- more --></p><!--figure[2]--><h2>Luca Guadagnino—<i>Call Me By Your Name </i></h2><p>Guadagnino (whose first language is Italian, hence the idiosyncrasies in the quotes to follow) says he was attracted to the adaptation of André Aciman’s novel <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/call-me-by-your-name/\"><i>Call Me By Your Name</i></a> because, “I always found myself restless as an audience member towards films that tells the coming of age that are […] basically relying on the cliché, on what is the assumption that the narrative has to deliver in order to get there.”</p><p>Asked which cliché he wanted to avoid in particular, Guadagnino says, “I think for instance that there is the idea that there is a contrast against the lovers, is something that is so artificial. You know? That there has to be somebody who is gonna contrast them, and then the lover will triumph. And in the gay canon it will triumph or maybe it will be bittersweet, it will not triumph.” </p><p><i>Call Me By Your Name</i> brings the teenaged Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer) into each other’s orbit via a long, hot summer at Elio’s family’s Italian villa. Clocking in at over two hours, it has a languid, unstructured feel, a narrative pattern directly inspired by Maurice Pialat’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/a-nos-amours/\"><i>À Nos Amours</i></a>. </p><p>“That was very, very, very dear to me. What is great about Pialat’s cinema is the capacity that he has always had to really the avoid the traps of a narrative and to be very at the center of his characters, and to really be letting live the flesh and blood and bone and sperm and every other kind of biological fruits of these characters, in a way that is really connected to his audience members because we are like the people in the screen. </p><p>“I wanted to prove that I could tell the story from the perspective of someone like Pialat instead of from the perspective of a three-act script.” </p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/luca-guadagninos-trio-of-films-about-love/\">See the trio of films about love that Luca Guadagnino chose for Letterboxd.</a></p><p>At the time of writing, <i>Call Me By Your Name</i> is sitting at the top of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/moulton/list/letterboxds-official-top-50-of-2017/\">Letterboxd’s ‘Unofficial’ Top 50 for 2017</a>, based on weighted ratings for the year to date.</p><!--figure[3]--><h2>Todd Haynes—<i>Wonderstruck </i></h2><p>Haynes directed the big screen version of Brian Selznick’s novel <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wonderstruck/\"><i>Wonderstruck</i></a>, which Selznick himself adapted. It’s an epic story split between two children in two different time frames, both confronting deafness and looking for family. Julianne Moore stars in two roles, one a silent-movie star. </p><p>As well as a tribute “to the endurance of New York, to the history of New York”, Haynes says <i>Wonderstruck</i> is also about “the imagination of young people, the language of cinema… and the theme of deafness”. Haynes said in planning this film, he thought a lot about the films he saw as a child, “the films that kind of entered my mind and bloodstream and changed the way I saw things. They were films that were always maybe a little beyond my reach.”</p><p>We asked Haynes, Selznick and Moore to share their memories of the films that changed the way they saw things as children. Haynes chose <i>Mary Poppins, Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> and <i>The Miracle Worker</i> as his key childhood movie memories. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/todd-haynes-childhood-movie-memories/detail/\">Visit the Letterboxd list to learn why</a>. </p><p>Selznick, who also wrote the novel <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hugo/\"><i>Hugo</i></a>, which Martin Scorsese adapted, says he “mostly loved monster movies” when he was a kid. “I was really into <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-phantom-of-the-opera/\"><i>The Phantom of the Opera</i></a>, the Lon Chaney silent movie. I grew up in New Jersey, so there was the ‘creature double-feature’ in the afternoon when I got back from school. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/frankenstein-1931/\">Frankenstein</a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bride-of-frankenstein/\">Bride of Frankenstein</a></i>, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/king-kong/\"><i>King Kong</i></a>. </p><p>“I’m distantly related to David O. Selznick who produced <i>King Kong</i> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gone-with-the-wind/\"><i>Gone With the Wind</i></a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rebecca/\"><i>Rebecca</i></a>, so there was also an added thrill of seeing my last name at the beginning of all of these movies that I really loved! Even though they were from the California movie-making side of the Selznicks, and I am from the New Jersey dry-cleaning side of the Selznicks. Successful dry-cleaner though, I have to say. </p><p>“And then, every year, looking forward to seeing <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wizard-of-oz-1939/\"><i>The Wizard of Oz</i></a> on TV when it was ever the holidays. And that moment, which I think is one of the great moments in cinema history, when Dorothy opens the door from her black and white world in Kansas into Oz.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Julianne Moore’s childhood movie memories are of the eclectic films programmed in a tiny Alaskan cinema, which ultimately transformed her approach to acting. </p><p>“When I was in fifth grade, my family moved to Juno, Alaska, and there was a movie theater in town that my sister and I went to every Saturday, no matter what. But because the population was so small in Juno they changed the movie every single week, so sometimes we’d go and see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-aristocats/\"><i>The Aristocats</i></a>, and then one week it would be like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich/\"><i>One Day in the Life</i></a> [from the novel by] Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. And then <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/minnie-and-moskowitz/\"><i>Minnie and Moskowitz</i></a>, which is a Cassavetes film! And they let us in! Every Saturday! I didn’t know what I was watching half the time. I really didn’t, not until years later. </p><p>“It wasn’t until I would see movies in a revival house in Boston when I was in college that I kind of drew a connection to these movies I saw when I was in fifth grade … and it was just this sort of different, very, very human point of view. So if you’re Ivan Denisovich and you’re in prison and you reach down and you pull up a fish eye in your soup—I remember that very distinctly!—you know, that creates a different kind of experience to you right away, and you’ve done that visually with a fish eye in a spoon. </p><p>“It was something that kind of honed my interest in behavior, in performance, so I became interested in less in a theatrical kind of performance and more of a cinematic one because of this guy who owned a theater in Juno, Alaska.”</p><p><b>For more coming of age films, try these Letterboxd lists:</b><br/></p><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/moviemaestro/list/teenage-wasteland-a-comprehensive-list-of/\">Teenage Wasteland: a Comprehensive List of Coming of Age Films<br/></a><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/soundturnedlow/list/a-film-of-myself-my-favourite-female-coming/\">A Film of Myself: My Favourite Female Coming of Age Films<br/></a><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/elliegocher/list/french-feminine-coming-of-age-cinema/\">French Feminine Coming of Age Cinema</a></p>"

The female characters are either prostitutes, pure evil, kept behind glass, disfigured or killed. After <em>Sicario</em>, I’m sensing a pattern.”</p>\n\n<p>But overall, the positive reviewers agree that it is a film <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film_skool_fail/film/blade-runner-2049/1/\">worth putting on your pants for</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>1-star pans</h2>\n\n<p>At the other end of the scale—aside from near-universal agreement about Deakins’ Oscar-worthy cinematography—reviewers have issues with the plot, the character development, the need for a sequel at all, and, again, the treatment of females. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/anettesvane/film/blade-runner-2049/\">Anette</a> found <em>2049</em> “pretty, but without purpose” and “shockingly sexist”. Others found the film “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/karge/film/blade-runner-2049/\">a misogynistic, dystopian mess</a>” that “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/noworst/film/blade-runner-2049/\">treats its women as disposable</a>”.</p>\n\n<p><!--figure[3]--></p>\n\n<p>Another common theme amongst <em>2049</em>’s detractors: whether the film’s central question was worth making an entire movie to ask. Not according to <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/kah/film/blade-runner-2049/\">Knut-Arne Heggen</a>: “Ultimately it feels contrived, bleak and without charm, almost devoid of ideas and not confident in the few it does play around with, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. The lazy script leaves the existentialism of the first in favor of an essentialist outlook which is completely uninteresting and oddly dated in a time when AI is a very hot topic.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/courtjester/film/blade-runner-2049/\">CourtJester</a> concurs: “<em>2049</em> tried to ride the line between cerebral visual poem and action blockbuster, and it failed in both respects. In part, this is because the original <em>Blade Runner</em> concept is not as unique or interesting as it once was. ‘Do clones have souls?’ was never a sound philosophical question, at least not as much as the oft-confused ‘do computers have souls?’. It was fun in the ’80s, but we know better now.”</p>\n\n<h2>About that run-time</h2>\n\n<p>Some of you are unimpressed (“<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/alexlovendahl/film/blade-runner-2049/\">what’s meant to seem patient seems ponderous</a>”) but for most, the 163-minute run time is “<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ndfurlong/film/blade-runner-2049/\">a non-issue</a>”. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/artisans/awards/blade-runner-2049-roger-deakins-interview-1202579857/\">The shoot may have felt long to Roger Deakins</a>, but “the almost-three-hours of this wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough for me, frankly, for both the ways in which it very much is <em>Blade Runner</em> and very much isn&rsquo;t,” writes <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/colonelmortimer/film/blade-runner-2049/\">Matt Lynch</a>. “So immersive and impressive that the run time did not bother me one bit!” <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/filmsandfaith/film/blade-runner-2049/\">Films and Faith</a> agrees.</p>\n\n<p><!--figure[4]--></p>\n\n<h2>On Deakins</h2>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/blade-runner-2049-lighting-cinematography/\">write-up</a> on Deakins’ lighting and cinematography is a worthwhile read, collecting material from many of his recent interviews and breaking down his lighting set-ups. And, like most of you, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-roger-deakins-cinematography-oscar-1201884071/\">IndieWire isn’t holding back</a> on its Oscar recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>What did you think?

When sorting by your (or another member’s) ratings, unrated films are moved to the end of the list (this is the case whether you’re sorting by highest or lowest first.)</p><p>We’ve also taken the opportunity to make a small but <a href=\"http://feedback.letterboxd.com/forums/136771-general/suggestions/2979946-watchlist-sort-in-a-random-order\">often-requested</a> addition to watchlists: if you’re lacking inspiration, you can now shuffle your own watchlist to return a random selection of films. Don’t like our suggestions? Scroll down and shuffle again.</p><p>These changes are live on the web, and coming to our <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/apps/\">iPhone app</a> in the next update.

      "body": "We’ve started a new community thing: the <b>Letterboxd Showdown</b>. Each week we will announce a category, and during that week you will create lists of your best, favorite or preferred films within that category, ideally with notes to back up your choices. Your lists should have a minimum of five films.</p><p>You’ll tag your list with the weekly Showdown tag, and we will host all the lists on a fancy new Showdown page. At the end of each week, we will announce the Top 20 of that week’s category based on group consensus.</p><p>The first Showdown (Most Remarkable Directorial Debut) produced <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tag/showdown:debut/lists/\">almost 300 lists at the time of writing</a>. We were blown away by the response and your well-considered choices, yet not at all surprised that Quentin Tarantino’s <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/reservoir-dogs/\">Reservoir Dogs</a></i> topped <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/showdown-most-remarkable-debut/\">the consensus</a>. (Did you catch <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/04/reservoir-dogs-reunion-quentin-tarantino-tribeca-1201810876/\">the recent Tribeca Film Festival reunion</a> for its 25th anniversary?)</p><p>And now… drum roll please… the second Letterboxd Showdown topic is: Favorite Remakes. (The tag is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/tag/showdown:remake/lists/\">showdown:remake</a>.)</p><p>We want you to list your favorite remakes, the films that blew you away as much as—or more than—the original, the films that updated the original in a thoughtful or insanely brilliant way, the films that transferred well across national borders, and survived translation across languages, the films that most cleverly rebooted a character or series, the films that most effectively took animation into live action and vice versa.</p><p>We take a fairly open view of what constitutes a remake and trust you do too. For example, there have been multiple film adaptions of a particular comic book or novel or stage play. Should the films that came after the first adaptation all be classified as remakes of the first film? Perhaps, perhaps not.For example, in the case of Louisa May Alcott’s <i>Little Women</i> the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-1949/\">1949 version directed by Mervyn LeRoy</a> is most certainly a remake of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women/\">George Cukor’s 1933 version</a>, as it uses the original’s script and music. Meanwhile, it could be argued that <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-1994/\">Gillian Armstrong’s 1994 version</a> is its own creation and possibly not a remake. But you may beg to differ and you can always explain your choices in your notes.</p><p>What about reboots? Well, not all reboots are remakes, and vice versa. <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/mad-max-fury-road/\">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></i> is considered a remake by some (not us); George Miller himself sees it as more of a “<a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/is-fury-road-a-sequel/\">revisiting</a>”. General rule of thumb, perhaps, is that the concept, plot and characters are loosely the same, while key actors change and details like period setting are adjusted/updated. On that basis, we suggest <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ghostbusters-2016/\">Ghostbusters</a></i> (2016) would be a remake <i>and</i> a reboot. Again, you may beg to differ; tell us why in your notes.</p><p>As with last week, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/karl/list/favourite-remakes/\">a few of our crew</a> have <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ggnz/list/letterboxd-showdown-favourite-remakes/\">made their own lists</a> to kick this Showdown off.</p><p>From now on, we’ll announce each week’s category via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/letterboxd\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/letterboxd/\">Facebook</a>, so keep an eye out there at the end of each week.</p>"

How do you communicate your vision to the cast and crew?</strong><br/>I’ve learned a lot since I started directed shorts years ago, and one thing I’ve realized is that the key to a successful production is finding the right people. So I’m very careful about casting and hiring key creative crew. In the past I’ve had major disasters getting the wrong people for key positions, so I interviewed many people until I found the right people. Once you have the right people, everything falls into place. So when I’m hiring a makeup artist, for example, I look at the person’s experience and expertise, but I also look at their personality. The makeup artist is the last person to see the actor before they go on set, so they have to be fun and relaxing, with an upbeat attitude. They also have to not resent me, not fight me, to trust in my vision, but to have their own creative vision. They have to be an innovator but be able to take direction, and they have to have speed and stamina.</p><p>It’s not as easy to find someone like that as you might think. In the first interview, usually people reveal their personality flaws quite quickly. They are whiny, controlling, disagreeable, argumentative, bossy, despondent, lazy, disrespectful, resentful, brittle, egotistical, thin-skinned, and so forth. So when you find a talented person with a great personality, you hold onto them.</p><p>It’s the same with actors. How prepared were they in their audition? How much do they want the part? How respectful are they of the script and the production? An actor can be very talented, but if they are not committed to the project and they don’t love the script, they can quit for a better part and leave you in the lurch. And they also have to be character types who have the personal integrity to never do something like that.</p><p>Once I get the right people, I’m like those generals who guide the army, but let the subordinate leaders (in my case, key department heads) make their own decisions. In war it’s called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission-type_tactics\"><em>auftragstaktik</em></a>. The subordinate leaders are aware of the mission, but they make their own decisions. So on an ideal set of mine, I hardly say anything to anyone. Everyone is in their own mental space, concentrating, contributing creatively and quietly towards a unified vision, and we are all working harmoniously like a buzzing hive. I use the military metaphor because that’s what a film set is like—it’s like war.</p><p><strong>Do you get the blues when shooting is over and the crew have gone home. If not, why not?</strong><br/>I used to get the blues when shooting was over, but I don’t anymore, because there is always so much work to do when shooting is over!</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the switch from writer to director to editor? What’s it like being alone in the edit suite with the emotional aftermath of the shoot?</strong><br/>Writing was painful on <em>The Love Witch</em> because I was teaching myself to write a more conventional screenplay, and the technique of doing that was surprisingly complicated. Then came a period of designing, finding locations, and crafting that went on way too long, since I didn’t have the financial support to hire people to help. That is always the longest and most complicated part of the process—the design. Part of that is also doing the storyboards. Then it’s casting and hiring people, then being on set.</p><p>On <em>The Love Witch</em> being on set wasn’t too challenging, since everything had been worked out ahead of time. It makes for a much longer pre-production phase, but a much smoother shoot. It was only difficult when I had to manage crowd scenes, since the A.D. seemed to disappear whenever I needed him, so I ended up running around physically gathering people for rehearsals, blocking crowds, and trying to shout to be heard without a megaphone, all of which felt quite stressful and chaotic. In fact, the entire production team sort of disappeared once we started shooting, so David (the cinematographer) and I felt like orphans managing a set on our own, which is not ideal. I chalk this up to having hired the wrong people for the <em>auftragstaktik</em>, so that the machine couldn’t run properly.</p><p>Editing is my favorite part of the process. It’s when I can be alone with my images and play. Since I am quite a voyeur, having this time alone to gaze at my actors and the worlds I’ve created for them is intensely pleasurable. And because of how much I am in thrall to these images, I don’t mind the endless hours of editing. They just seem to fly by.</p><p><strong>What are your favorite or most personally inspiring love stories on film? And what film love stories have you hated!</strong><br/>I love <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/duel-in-the-sun/\"><em>Duel in the Sun</em></a>. So sexy and outrageous. Tragic too—they kill each other in the end, but it’s a shoot-out, and she is so intense and so beautiful, playing a half-breed in brown make-up. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/wuthering-heights/\"><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> is also a heartbreaker—Cathy, played by Merle Oberon, dies because of her refusal to admit to her brutal love for the earthy stable boy played by Laurence Olivier. (Actually Buñuel’s version is even better than the Hollywood version). I love <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/notorious/\"><em>Notorious</em></a>—how Ingrid Bergman is willing to throw her life away in marriage to Nazi Claude Rains because she thinks, erroneously, that Cary Grant has rejected her. And <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gone-with-the-wind/\"><em>Gone With the Wind</em></a>, where Vivienne Leigh is unaware of which man she truly loves, and goes through countless adventures to discover it.</p><p>I also love <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/forever-amber/\"><em>Forever Amber</em></a>, in which the beautiful Linda Darnell has to marry the king but is in love with Cornell Wilde. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg/\"><em>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</em></a> is a great love story, about people who are too young to shoulder the responsibilities of love so they lose it tragically, but the film that shares an ending with it, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/la-la-land/\"><em>La La Land</em></a>, is not a great love story. That’s a film where the characters can’t even muster up the energy to stay together. And when they meet again, they can’t get up the energy to give up other things in their lives for one another. So it’s not a real love story. In real love stories, people die for love, kill for love, and if love is unrequited they go mad (like in <em>The Love Witch</em>).</p><!--figure[3]--><p><strong><em>The Love Witch</em> made us feel despairing and elated about the possibilities of heterosexual love. You’ve also been described as having a ‘playfully violent female gaze’. Can you tell us about your approach to wielding the power of cinema to dissect relationships between men and women?</strong><br/>I’m mainly just trying to describe banal things that happen between men and women, albeit in a somewhat gothic setting. But I think the way cinema wields power is that people can become very engaged with it emotionally. So if you are telling personal stories from a woman’s point of view, that can be a powerful way of bringing out hidden emotions in women about similar experiences, or a way for men to experience a little bit emotionally what it’s like to be a woman. The power relations in my movies are very front and center, and this elicits a lot of emotions from people, both positive and negative.</p><p><strong>We were somewhat heartbroken when Elaine seduced Trish’s husband, as Elaine and Trish had a wonderfully awkward intimacy: the way they negotiated their way into a conversation; the way Trish initially overcame their beauty power imbalance with her practical views. Can you tell us about that decision and what their relationship meant to you?</strong><br/>\nI always knew that Elaine would try to destroy Trish. Trish and Elaine were destined to never be real friends because of Elaine’s toxic narcissism. You would think that Trish would be jealous of Elaine because of her beauty and power over men, but actually it was the other way around; Elaine was jealous of Trish. And so Elaine tried to steal Trish’s husband to have what Trish had, but in doing so destroyed him. But that was always in Elaine’s character. I don’t feel that Trish lost anything of value in losing Elaine as a friend. Elaine is a fascinating character, but not someone you want around your husband or boyfriend!</p><p><strong>When people think of auteurs, they don’t necessarily think of a person dealing with the pressure of directing while also performing other key creative roles on set like production designer. How do you combine working with the actors and crew as the director with that?</strong><br/>Production design and costume design are extremely time-consuming, but most of that work is done before shooting begins. It only becomes difficult when certain things can’t be done ahead of time. So for instance, props and furniture can’t be tagged too far ahead of time, so after the first two weeks of shooting, I’m using any days off from the set to run around tagging props and furniture, hoping that the things I’ve decided to use are there and not checked out, that sort of thing. And I’m also very busy on prep days, decorating the set. I don’t get any days off, when the rest of the crew does. And sometimes I’m busy going through boxes of candles or vases when I should be by the camera, directing.</p><p><strong>Watching <em>The Love Witch</em>, we felt like we were experiencing a new cinematic language, something bigger and stronger than the list of influences that has been discussed elsewhere. Can you tell us about that?</strong><br/>\nMy approach is very classical. I study classic screenplays, classic lighting, acting, design, and I’m very serious about my craft. I try to put all of that together with a personal story that’s also mythic and archetypal. I also am interested in creating aesthetic arrest and glamour on the screen. Classic movies often had these same concerns, and these are my favorite movies. If it seems new, perhaps that’s because it is being made today and not fifty or sixty years ago, and consciously from a female point of view.</p><!--figure[4]--><p><strong>You’ve said you heavily researched witchcraft to create <em>The Love Witch</em>. Can you tell us about your favorite witches on screen?</strong><br/>\nMy favorites are Kim Novak in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/bell-book-and-candle/\"><em>Bell, Book and Candle</em></a>, Veronica Lake in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/i-married-a-witch/\"><em>I Married a Witch</em></a>, and Rosanna Schiaffino in <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-witch/\"><em>La Strega in Amore</em></a>.</p><p><strong>The exceptional beauty of Elaine is one of the strong notes in the film. We could hardly look away from her. It felt like she invited us in though, rather than pushing the viewer away. We could project ourselves on her, and live vicariously through her. Can you tell us about how you wanted women to react to her? And men too?</strong><br/>I myself fell in love with Samantha’s image and found it very arresting, especially when she was in costume and makeup, and I was hoping that female viewers would feel the same way I did. It’s very gratifying to find that her image worked the same way with many female viewers as it did on me! I am constantly being asked about her makeup for instance, girls wanting to imitate her style and special brand of glamour and hoping some of her power rubs off on them. And I also expected for women to identify with her emotionally, which is also happening.</p><p>I expected men to be aroused by her, and that’s happening too, although I did expect for them to perhaps have a little more feeling for her as a human being, which sadly is quite rare, but does happen sometimes. One male fan on Twitter recently wrote that at the end of the film, when Elaine is riding away on her unicorn, he sobbed aloud, “Love me!”. That was really great to hear, and quite touching.</p><p><strong>Was it a battle to shoot on film?</strong><br/>Post was a bit difficult because there is not the support there used to be with negative cutting and printing from an original negative, but I had a skilled camera crew, so it was not a problem on set. I love the way shooting on film makes everyone on set concentrate so deeply. It’s like a church. And actors usually nail it on the first take, because they are aware of the cost of shooting multiple takes.</p><p><strong>Do feminists shoot on film?</strong><br/>I don’t know if the medium one chooses has anything to do with politics.</p><p><strong>Do you have somebody you think of as a mentor?</strong><br/>Not really. I’ve had a few good teachers, but no one I’m still in conversation with. I use the great filmmakers as my mentors.</p><p><strong>It’s impossible to watch <em>The Love Witch</em> without thinking of <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em>. Other than the satanic rituals, it also brought to mind the collaboration between Roman Polanski and Mia Farrow. Can you tell us a bit about how you built your creative relationship with your lead actress?</strong><br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/rosemarys-baby/\"><em>Rosemary’s Baby</em></a> was indeed a big inspiration for <em>The Love Witch</em>. As for my relationship with Samantha, we just rolled up our sleeves and got to work. It was mostly about breaking down the script, creating the character arc, things like that. We got along really well and worked very fluidly together, so I was very rewarding for both of us. It felt like we were truly creating the character together, and we had a lot of fun doing so.</p><p><strong>Do you think you approach actor relationships in a unique way, or if there are differences in the way women direct women?</strong><br/>I think there was a level of trust between Samantha and me that would not have been there if I was a man. I just intuitively sensed that, so in all of our rehearsals it was just the two of us. Some actresses feel more comfortable with a man present, and with those actresses I make sure a man is there validating their performance in rehearsals. I just go with the actor and what they need. Maybe that’s a female way of directing? I don’t know.</p><p><strong>The wonderful scene with the tampon in the urine brought to mind Catherine Breillat’s <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/anatomy-of-hell/\"><em>Anatomy of Hell</em></a>, and her history of bringing complex <em>femmes fatale</em> to the screen. Do you have particular women directors and artists who you are inspired or influenced by?</strong><br/>Well, Breillat certainly has been an inspiration for me. I learned from her that there’s a way to shoot explicit scenes without having them be pornographic, and that having theoretical text over sex scenes kills men’s desire. I specifically tested this in my burlesque scene, where a gorgeous dancer strips down to pasties to the droning of witches spouting gender theory, and I found that this is true. I also have been inspired by Chantal Akerman, Dorothy Arzner, Bette Gordon, Ida Lupino, and Lizzy Borden, among others. And I love Joan Crawford.</p><p><strong>We saw elsewhere that you mention having seen <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/salo-or-the-120-days-of-sodom/\"><em>Salò</em></a>. When we watched <em>The Love Witch</em> we also found ourselves thinking of particular books; of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/justine/\"><em>Justine</em></a>, <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/venus-in-furs/\"><em>Venus in Furs</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/torture-garden/\"><em>Torture Garden</em></a>, but also fairy tales like <em>Cinderella</em> and <em>The Snow Queen</em>. Can you tell us about your inspirations or influences that aren’t films? Books, plays, paintings, fashion and the like?</strong><br/>When I was a child I read a lot of fairy tales. I think all of my films are fairy tales on some level. I was also an avid Shakespeare fan, and I loved symbolist poetry and theater, and nineteenth-century novels. These were my earliest loves, and I think it’s all there in my films. I grew up also looking at a lot of painting. My favorites were the fauves, the German expressionists, and the medieval painters. Because of this, my set sketches have that weird Matisse perspective, and I can’t seem to get out of that, although it’s not that helpful to my carpenters! As an adult I read a lot of psychology and theory. But the biggest influences on my movies are other movies. I love movies about the theater. Someday I want to make a movie set in the theater world, perhaps a musical.</p><!--figure[5]--><p><strong>Recently you tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/missannabiller/status/841083030294867968/photo/1\">a paragraph on “the last thing I’ll say about <em>The Love Witch</em>”</a>. At the risk of asking you to break this vow, we’d love to hear your perspective on critics, their hot takes on your film, and your desire to make sure you are heard when they ascribe meaning to your films that you did not intend. It feels like you’re laying crumbs for other women filmmakers to follow away from the trolls?</strong><br/>I really do hope that I am laying crumbs for other women to follow. That would be great! I think that I am in a unique position as a female filmmaker who is specifically challenging the idea that the male is the only spectator in the cinema, or the only creator of meaning. So it’s sort of a social experiment; first of all, making a film which is designed to elicit different views along gender lines, and then pointing out all of the misunderstandings and judgments that come from this experiment.</p><p><strong>You’ve told us your next film will be a Bluebeard story (and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/bluebeard-movies-an-anna-biller-selection/\">made this list for us of classic Bluebeard films</a>). What was your first experience of a Bluebeard tale, and why are you going there yourself?</strong><br/>I really don’t remember my first experience of a Bluebeard tale. It was probably the fairy tale itself, since I read so many fairy tales as a child. But there are Bluebeard tales all over culture. Every slasher movie is a Bluebeard tale, almost every horror movie, and certainly every story about domestic violence. I remember as a child watching a lot of movies where men kill women, and being frightened of them. I decided to make a Bluebeard movie because I realized that a lot of my favorite movies are Bluebeard movies, and I think these types of stories have a special appeal to women.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ex-machina-2015/\"><em>Ex Machina</em></a>—especially the chamber of horrors scene towards the end—brings the Bluebeard story to mind. We have regular arguments at HQ about whether that film is feminist or misogynist. If you saw the film, what did you think, and did it make your list?</strong><br/>\nI have to confess, I haven’t seen that movie (although now I am curious). So <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/bluebeard-movies-an-anna-biller-selection/\">it didn’t make my list</a>, but it wouldn’t anyway, since my list only includes classic movies (the newest movie on it is from 1974).</p><p><strong>What film first gave you a “teenage feeling”?</strong><br/>Probably <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/romeo-and-juliet-1968/\"><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></a> or <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gold-diggers-of-1933/\"><em>Gold Diggers of 1933</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Can you reveal to us some of your screen heartthrobs through the ages?</strong><br/>Gregory Peck, Joel McCrea, Brian Aherne, Leslie Howard, Michael Wilding, Tony Curtis, Richard Basehart, Rod Taylor, James Stewart, Alain Delon, Charles Boyer, and Dirk Bogarde, to name a few.</p><!--figure[6]-->"

By pledging to watch one woman-directed film every week of the year, it’s a creative way to get more of us watching and talking about female-directed films.</p><p>We talked to Kirsten about the campaign, and she kindly compiled <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/11-essential-films-directed-by-women-a-52filmsbywomen/\">this taster list for Letterboxd of 11 Essential Films Directed by Women</a>. We’ve also included a list of our favorite women-directed film lists by Letterboxd members.</p><p><b>How did #52FilmsByWomen come about and what’s the goal?<br/></b>In the fall of 2015, as we were getting ready to launch <a href=\"https://womeninfilm.org/\">our new website</a> and our partnership with Turner Classic Movies, we were trying to think about ways the power of the Internet could help advance our cause.</p><p>Part of the impetus for this initiative came from thinking about <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/pdf/artist-programs/wfi/phase-iii-research---female-filmmakers-initiative.pdf\">our research with Sundance Institute and Dr. Stacey Smith at USC</a>—as a result of this research, we found out how few people could name more than a handful of women directors. </p><p>This initiative seemed like a great way to spread awareness of all the wonderful artists who are out there, and hopefully cement their names into the hearts and minds of both consumers and decision-makers in the industry.</p><p><b>What cultural/intellectual/emotional responses are you seeing from people who are committing to watching at least one female-directed film per week for a year?  <br/></b>A couple months ago we spoke to a #52FilmsByWomen pledger named Brandy who has a weekly watching party for #52Films in her Chicago home. She told us that she has identified as a feminist for a long time, and so she expected the pledge to be fun, but not “groundbreaking”, which is what it turned out to be.</p><p>I think this response is typical, which is part of the reason we have over 11,000 #52FilmsByWomen pledges; it’s also why many of our pledgers write us to tell us that they are doing the pledge a second year. There is something incredibly powerful about feeling alone in your experience of the world, and then seeing an experience that echoes yours brought to life on the silver screen. I think that happens frequently for women (and even some others) who make our pledge.</p><p><b>Women producers, women writers, women editors have a huge role in guiding the telling of a story. Stupid question, maybe, but what difference does it make who directs a movie?  <br/></b>Men, and especially white men, have a certain privileged experience of the world. Although he’s specifically speaking about writing literature and not making movies, I think <a href=\"http://ofgrammatology.tumblr.com/post/62134937653/if-youre-a-boy-writer-its-a-simple-rule-youve\">Junot Diaz’s words on this subject</a> still hold up in the context of directing, because directors take a major part of the responsibility for character development in a film.</p><p>Diaz says that their privilege means that men “have a very distorted sense of women’s subjectivity”, whereas women have “spent their whole life being taught that men have a subjectivity”.</p><p>If you are working with a female director, regardless of whether the rest of the key crew are women (which, by the way, is a rare situation), you are far more likely to see balance between the genders in the richness with which a film’s characters are developed. If you listen to testimony from actresses on working with different directors in intimate scenes, you can learn a lot about the difference working with a woman can make.</p><!--figure[2]--><p><b>How do you get more films directed by women? There are ample mentoring gigs and development pathways, but could it be as simple as <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/11/28/female-directors-dont-need-experience-they-just-need-to-get-hired/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#1c105c3423a3\">just giving them the job</a>?  <br/></b>I have no doubt that, if industry decision-makers gave inexperienced women challenging opportunities the way they so easily do for men, we would have at least as many breakout directors as a result. The reasons this doesn’t happen have a lot to do with systems that perpetuate unconscious bias, and this is something we hope to get underneath over time.</p><p>In the meantime, I would recommend to readers that they take the biggest risk that’s available within their personal capacity to help women. If you are a moviegoer, that could simply mean <a href=\"https://womeninfilm.org/52-films\">making the #52FilmsByWomen pledge</a>, and supporting female filmmakers in the box office and at home (you can help a director’s stats just by adding her film to your Netflix queue). It could mean supporting a woman’s <a href=\"https://www.seedandspark.com/\">Seed &amp; Spark</a> campaign.</p><p>If you are in the industry, offering your mentorship and aggressively extolling the virtues of female filmmakers you like can really help. Finally, if you are a person who has the clout to give a female director a job—or even put her on a list then yes: do that, and then do it again.</p><h2>A Selection of #DirectedByWomen Lists on Letterboxd</h2><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/soirore/list/52-films-by-women-ultimate-challenge-2017/\">52 Films By Women—Ultimate Challenge 2017</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/mittland/list/female-friendship-by-female-directors/\">Female Friendship by Female Directors</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/lise/list/female-directors/\">Female Directors (a list by Lise)</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/wampeter57/list/100-highest-rated-entries-on-letterboxd-directed/\">100 Highest Rated Entries on Letterboxd Directed by Women</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/wampeter57/list/100-most-popular-entries-on-letterboxd-directed/\">100 Most Popular Entries on Letterboxd Directed by Women</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/sophieberg/list/365-female-directors/\">365 Female Directors</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/olearysreellife/list/directedbywomen-film-viewing-possibilities/\">#DirectedbyWomen Film Viewing Possibilities</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/soirore/list/woman-made-documentaries/\">Woman-made Documentaries</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/deedeee/list/latin-american-female-directors/\">Latin-American Female Directors</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/asianfanatic/list/east-asian-female-directors/\">East Asian Female Directors</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ggnz/list/52filmsbywomen-the-downunder-edition/\">52 Films By Women—The Downunder Edition</a>  <br/><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/arthurlafayette/list/25-highest-grossing-films-by-female-directors/\">25 Highest Grossing Films by Female Directors</a></p>"

The Rialto Channel New Zealand Film Awards, popularly known as The Moas, were held just down the road from Letterboxd HQ on Saturday, 18 February 2017. We were proud to sponsor the Best Production Design category, because we like good design. Congrats to Kiwi legend Kim Sinclair for his winning work in the category for <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/slow-west/\">Slow West</a></i>.</p><p><!--figure[1]--><small><em>It us! L–R: Karl and Gemma from Letterboxd, Hunt for the Wilderpeople’s Best Actor Julian Dennison, Matthew from Letterboxd, Hunt for the Wilderpeople’s Best Supporting Actress Rima Te Wiata.</em></small></p><p>Eligible films included the local box office smash hit <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople/\">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a></i>, and Scottish director John Maclean’s <i>Slow West</i>, which was filmed in New Zealand and produced by New Zealander Rachel Gardner. The eligibility period was wider than usual because, New Zealand being a smallish country, we sometimes have to wait to amass enough local films to hold an awards ceremony.</p><p>The full list of feature and documentary film winners is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/crew/list/new-zealand-film-awards-2017/detail/\">here</a>. Congratulations to all of the nominated and winning filmmakers!</p><p>Huge congratulations also to writer, director and producer Gaylene Preston who was honoured with the Services to Cinema Award on the night. Gaylene is our film industry’s much-loved godmother, and she received a fitting introduction from Sam Neill, fresh from a Best Supporting Actor win for his work as Uncle Hec in <i>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</i> and one of the stars of her 2003 film <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-strangers/\">Perfect Strangers</a></i>.</p><p>Introducing the award, Neill said his friendship with Preston goes “back to the middle of last century, which is actually sadly but literally true. That’s kind of handy because it would be awkward to give this award to someone you didn’t actually like.”</p><p>Neill said Preston “is someone who’s had (and continues to have) a long and fruitful career, and has contributed to New Zealand cinema as much if not more than anyone I can think of… Someone who’s received about a dozen New Zealand film awards. Actually, I wrote here, that’s a dozen more than me. It’s actually 11 more than me, now. I’m amazed that I got assistant actor, because when you’re cast in a film with all those bloody scene-stealers… Anyway, I got it, so they’re not getting it!”</p><p>Concluding his intro, Neill said Preston has been “a great mentor and a friend and a collaborator to so many of us in the world of film here, to crew to cast, and particularly to women. [Her] work has resonated on so many different and profound levels… She is the quintessential New Zealand storyteller.”</p><p>You can watch Sam’s intro and Gaylene’s moving acceptance speech at 2:06:00 in <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154326177792043&amp;id=13706267042\">this Facebook Live video of the awards</a>. Also keep an eye out for director Danny Boyle (in town for the local premier of <i><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/t2-trainspotting/\">T2: Trainspotting</a></i>) and stuntwoman Zoe Bell!</p>"

      "sub_title": "The Calculations",
      "abstract": "",
      "body": "\n\n<p>We’ve spent the past couple of weeks compiling and fine-tuning the results, based on our community’s combined ratings as at January 1, 2017. We use the same method every year to calculate the results: films must be feature-length (sorry, <em>O.J.: Made in America</em>), narrative or documentary (sorry, <em>Lemonade</em>) and have been rated by a minimum number of members (sorry, <em>20th Century Women</em>). Other than these criteria, all films that had at least a limited theatrical run in the US during 2016 are eligible for inclusion, which explains why some films that premiered at festivals in 2015 are included (e.g. <em>Green Room</em>). For this, we must once again thank <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/gemko/\">Mike D’Angelo</a> for his excellent resource: a definitive <a href=\"http://www.panix.com/~dangelo/nymaster16.html\">list</a> of the year’s NYC theatrical releases. (The only sections in which this release window rule does not apply are “Ones to Watch”, which highlights the highest rated films seen by a smaller number of members, and “Most Obsessively Rewatched”, which can include films released in any year.)</p>\n\n<p>As on the site, we differentiate between popular films (a measure of the amount of activity a film receives regardless of rating) and highly rated films. Rankings in the “Highest Rated” categories are based on the same weighted average used on the site (the ‘weighted’ part refers to a mechanism that ensures a more accurate average rating for films with a low number of ratings, and is based on the approach used by IMDb).</p>\n\n<p>All of the above will explain why the official Letterboxd Year in Review differs from Jack Moulton’s excellent and popular <a href=\"http://boxd.it/HrZi\">Top 50 list</a>, in case you’ve been following along with that. It also explains the omission of Ezra Edelman’s terrific 463-minute <a href=\"http://boxd.it/d7zi\">O.J. Simpson miniseries</a>, which otherwise would have taken the top spot in the documentary category—as it did have a butt-numbing theatrical release—and which you should definitely check out in the comfort of your own home!</p>\n\n<h2>The Results</h2>\n\n<p>No more dilly-dallying, here it is:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/2016/\"><strong>The 2016 Letterboxd Year in Review</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>On devices with keyboards, we recommend using the up/down arrow keys to navigate between pages. As for previous years, we’ve compiled longer lists for the main categories and published these under the <code><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/crew/tag/yir2016/lists/\">yir2016</a></code> tag.</p>\n\n<p>We sent this year’s review to our Patrons for feedback a couple of days ago, and asked them to suggest some lesser-seen reviews they enjoyed this year. You’ll find their suggestions near the end of the review, along with a message from one of our favorite directors. Happy new year and thanks for participating!</p>"

      "body": "<p>\n\n</p><p>Letterboxd is all about sharing and enjoying opinions about film. That works well when we understand differences of opinion are important, and when we practice robust yet respectful discussion. When you sign up, you agree to abide by our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/legal/community-policy/\">community policy</a>. We’ve deliberately kept it short but here’s a shorter version still: be cool. Add to conversations, rather than subverting them. Back off if you don’t appear welcome. Respect other people’s space.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Lately, though, the line between cool and uncool has become blurred. Our policy exists to describe the types of behavior we find uncool. These include general unpleasantness, snark, attacks or abuse aimed at other members, all the way up to what we would collectively term “hate speech”. We don’t censor for language that doesn’t also breach our policy: we like to get sweary. We fuckin’ <em>looove</em> to get fuckin’ sweary. But we are fans of profanity in context. “This movie fucking rules!” = cool. “Your opinions fucking suck” = not cool (curiously, also “your opinions suck” = not cool).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Our moderators don’t see every line the community writes. If you see something you find distasteful, please report it via the “flag” icon on the review, list or comment in question and let our moderators review the content, infer the necessary context and take appropriate action.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Sometimes it’s not obvious what action our moderators have taken. For content that falls short of being outright removed, we may just hide it from public view. In the case of lists and reviews, this means that people won’t find the content unless they are sent a link, or follow the author. As the person reporting it, you may not even be aware any action has been taken! Our aim here is to pour water on the fire, rather than fossil fuel. We think the best thing you can do at that point, is to close the tab and move on. In situations where content doesn’t directly contravene our guidelines, our moderators may also point you to the block function.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>We’re posting this because it really, really means a huge amount to us to have our community be the change we want to see on the internet. When good old misunderstandings or vigorous differences of opinion just can’t be risen above, and people won’t let go, we hope blocking and reporting will help.</p><p>\n\n<h2>Planned changes</h2>\n\n</p><p>Blocking a member currently means you don’t see their content or actions (except on the public pages we cache for all visitors, such as the main <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/\">Films</a> page), and they are no longer permitted to post comments on your reviews or lists. To block a member, visit their profile and click/tap the “flag” icon.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>For some of you, blocking works well. Others have told us they’d like these tools to have more reach. Up till now, blocking a member who posted unwanted comments on your reviews and lists hid their comments for you, but not for anyone else visiting your pages (unless they had also blocked the same member). An upcoming change to the way blocking works will give you more control over your own content: when you block a member, all their comments on your reviews and lists will be hidden for everyone. Your reviews and lists are your space; if you don’t want someone there, and they won’t leave, blocking will resolve this.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>We believe the Letterboxd community can set a higher standard of online conversation. Let’s respect each other, remain calm, offer second chances, leave when not welcome, co-exist and be excellent to each other. We have seen it happen. We like to imagine that if Letterboxd was a real-life thing, it would be a film festival after-party that everyone’s invited to; the bar is well stocked, the tiny hors d’oeuvres never run out, and the conversations flow like Lubezki’s camera, everyone getting their two cents and/or thesis-length thoughts in. And, that if the conversation isn’t working for you, you can wander off to another corner where it is.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>We believe in the ability of our community to identify each other as fellow humans-with-feelings, because we’ve seen so many instances of this already. You do you, we’ll do us, and together we’ll maybe figure out what the fuck those heptapod ink-squirts all mean.</p><p>\n\n</p>"

And yes, I had grown up in the punk/hardcore scene in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. and had been in a band in high school. Many of my friends are still in bands and have toured the States, so I went to a few of their shows and interviewed them about being on the road and dynamics between band members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything innately political about Green Room? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/garyshannon/\">garyshannon</a></strong><br/>\nYes. Lots of political undertones when I wrote it in 2013/14, but I couldn’t predict how relevant it would become in 2016. Ugh. My statement wasn’t the obvious ‘Nazis are bad’, it was more about loosely paralleling mainstream American conservative power structure in Darcy’s gang. The elite few at the top give marching orders to those beneath them, using ideology and misinformation to cause division and animosity between those who are ‘fighting the fight’ but unwittingly are serving interests other than their own. But that’s all underneath.

We pre-recorded the Ain’t Rights songs and let them listen to it across the Atlantic (Callum and Joe were UK based).

My band never toured, but lots of my friends’ bands did.

As a filmmaker, do you have Kubrick-like attention to detail? Is every shot purposefully done with things in the foreground, background, and mid-ground all meaning something? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/cutler/\">Cutler</a></strong><br/>\nI wouldn’t compare myself to Kubrick, but I am indeed a fiend for detail! But no, I don’t need everything to mean something. I prefer to take an intuitive approach to how I choose shots and design scenes. Sometimes I let technical or logistical limitations guide my choices too, like in the roadhouse/bathroom stall murder scene in <em>Blue Ruin</em> I chose to go 100% hand-held because we simply couldn’t fit any camera support gear in the tight space!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the best anecdote you can remember from when you were filming <em>Green Room</em>? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/carlosr/\">Carlos Riquelme</a></strong><br/>\nThe pit bulls, the gore and blood, the stunts, the shoot-outs and the pyro effects all went more or less according to plan, often taking less time than we allocated to shoot intense action scenes. But we almost lost an important scene because we got bogged down shooting a fucking insert of a knife landing on the dirt. INSERTS ARE THE WORST!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you manage to convince Slayer to allow the use of their music in this film, as well as the Dead Kennedys, etc.? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/whitewolf/\">Michael Miller</a></strong><br/>\nWe were very lucky in that respect. “Nazi Punks, Fuck Off” was the only song actually written into the script, so that was cleared before we shot. Slayer, Napalm Death, Midnight, etc. were all supportive of the film and were eager to see the scene portrayed on screen with authenticity, energy, and respect. Plus, we paid them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As an experienced cinematographer what was it like giving the job over to someone else on <em>Green Room</em>? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/chiefinspector/\">ChiefInspector</a></strong><br/>\nIt was a huge load off my shoulders. There are other films down the line I might shoot myself, but <em>Green Room</em> was way too much to handle. Sean Porter was a huge asset and powered through when I faltered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also are a you fan of punk music or was that just a decision for the film itself? Loved the Nothing sticker on the van. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/bvgf/\">Zac Barr</a></strong><br/>\nThe Nothing sticker was one of many that we received permission to use as props. I had not known much about the band (I’ve been out of the scene for well over a decade) but have since become familiar with them. They kindly showed up to one of the <em>Green Room</em> screenings in NYC and handed me a vinyl album!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How hard was it to choose the specifics for things like the record that is stolen, or the collection of stickers on the van? The sticker for the band Nothing made me gasp in the theater more than anything else—thank you for the great work! —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/hot_dog/\">Hot Dog</a></strong><br/>\nThanks. Glad you connected with such a detail. There’s so many little details in this film, but I hope they add up for people in the scene. It’s rare one finds a movie that seems custom made JUST FOR YOU. That was the effect I was going for. I licensed a Fear song, just to incorporate Lee Ving’s signature “1, 2, 3, 4 … 1, 2, 3, 4” count off for all the peeps that would get it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you think of Bobby Burns’ 70s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/L_3OPam3Vf4\">Grindhouse edit</a> of your <em>Green Room</em> trailer? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/tylerhenry/\">Tyler Henry</a></strong><br/>\nIt was rad. The fact that my work is getting the ‘fan-art’ treatment is a huge honor!</p>\n\n<!--figure[3]--><p><strong>What was it like working with Patrick Stewart? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/cantinaband/\">Wes</a></strong><br/>\nSir Patrick was great. Dedicated, kind, and humble. Was shocked he came aboard this film but in retrospect he was the only choice to play Darcy!</p>\n\n</p><p><strong><em>Green Room</em> is for me one of this year&rsquo;s best films and the best horror movie in ages. After watching it I felt like it somehow was a modern <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em>. Has Tobe Hooper influenced the film or you, or is this all just my imagination? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/paperinukke/\">Paperinukke</a></strong><br/><em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/\">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a></em> has certainly influenced me as a filmmaker, and I certainly see some parallels, but it wasn’t a primary reference for <em>Green Room</em> (perhaps subconsciously?). My main reference was <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/straw-dogs/\">Straw Dogs</a></em>, and that was the only film I watched and broke down before I wrote the script.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>In the van in <em>Green Room</em> I noticed a <em>Dragonlance</em> book. Who is your favorite character in the <em>Dragonlance</em> series and which is your favorite book? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/ghostsmut/\">Ghostsmut</a></strong><br/>\nWe put that there for the fellow nerds. I actually wasn’t that into the series, was more into skateboarding and playing AD&amp;D. Macon Blair was more the <em>Dragonlance</em> guy. Hold on, I’ll text him…</p>\n\n</p><p><em>Macon Blair</em>: Tasselhoff Burfoot (character), <em>Dragons of Autumn Twilight</em> (book).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>[An hour later]: But upon further reflection… Tasselhoff was my favorite main character, especially when I was young, but Lord Soth the Deathknight is probably the coolest supporting character. Much more metal. Kind of a ripoff of the ring wraiths from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> but still, very badass.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Green Room</em> is my favorite film of the year, nothing will make a better experience than watching in a theater the same day that Prince passed away and when his name was mentioned, and the audience screamed and cheered with thunderous applause, a chill ran through my body. How was it working with A24, my favorite distribution company? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/pocketwriter/\">Andres Guzman</a></strong><br/>\nWow, thanks! The Prince reference was a bizarre, beautiful, bittersweet thing I’ll never forget. Glad the film had such an effect on you. <a href=\"http://a24films.com/\">A24</a> has been a wonderful distribution partner. They’re great people and they’re building an amazing brand. They take great care of their filmmakers and I’m developing my next project with them now!</p>\n\n<p><strong>I’m a huge fan of 1990 classic <em>Home Alone</em> and particularly Devin Ratray’s searing performance as Buzz McCallister. When he showed up in <em>Blue Ruin</em> a great movie became a stone-cold classic. What made you think that one of cinema’s greatest villains could play such a sympathetic and understanding character? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/csw76/\">Chad S. Walsky</a></strong><br/>\nI didn’t know Devin was Buzz from <em>Home Alone</em> when he auditioned. He actually came in for the role of Teddy, but was too young to play that part. His performance was so damn good, however, I couldn’t let him go so I offered him the role of Ben, who is Dwight’s contemporary and a much better fit for Devin. I had full faith and trust in him because he was not only extremely talented, but also a huge fan of the script—he knew it backwards and forwards. He also chugged an entire large water bottle for his audition and that attention to detail, that use of props, his focus on the physicality of the performance was exactly in line with my filmmaking philosophy.</p>\n\n</p><p><strong>Can we get Aint Rights merch? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/brodyconing/\">BrodyConing</a></strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.lastexittonowhere.com/catalogue/aint-rights-black-regular-t-shirt_7/\">Yes!</a></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve often mentioned that one of the big lessons you learned from project to project was the importance of getting as long of a shooting schedule as possible. What has more time on set helped you out most with? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/franknada/\">franknada</a></strong><br/>\nWell, I gave myself 30 days to shoot <em>Blue Ruin</em>. That was a film I designed with nothing but support and a unified mission to feed the story all it needed to be told well. I used the time to shoot in many more locations than a typical indie production would allow (80), to have the luxury of shooting in waning light (dawn for dawn and dusk for dusk), and to put all the money on screen (which means low wages, unfortunately). Overall, the lighting was simple, but we were able to shoot lots of coverage when we needed (for action scenes) and to hire extra hands for night exterior work, where we used every light on our three-ton grip truck.</p>\n\n</p><p>There wasn’t really time to conceive of or integrate new ideas into the story, though. It was all about execution of the script. So it wasn’t so much that we had all the time in the world, we just rejected the standard 18-day shooting schedule of sub-$500,000 indies. The usual model is unnecessarily difficult and breeds anything but an artistic environment. For <em>Green Room</em>, I had a lot more to deal with and the budget and schedule were cut last minute, so those 30 days seemed very different to me, and the shoot was far more difficult.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[4]--><small><em>Green Room and Blue Ruin director Jeremy Saulnier</em></small></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Even if you had unlimited time and resources, would you still like to work at a certain pace and hit a certain page count each day? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/franknada/\">franknada</a></strong><br/>\nMy dream is one to three pages a day of ‘visual storytelling’ and five to ten pages a day if we’re getting into dialogue. By having that balance, you can dig into action and take your time, and make up for it with simple, human conversations that get you back on a healthy pace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was it like working with the z-jib on <em>Green Room</em>? Why use the z-jib versus a regular jib or technocrane? Sean Porter made it sound really appealing in an interview but he also mentioned that it was awkward and he could see why it didn’t get much use. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/franknada/\">franknada</a></strong><br/>\nDON’T USE A Z-JIB IF YOU DON’T NEED TO! We made do with that gear, and learned to love it when it saved our ass on a few days, but we only had that because we couldn’t afford a crane/libra head combo!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you make the decision to shoot ProPres on <em>Green Room</em>? I was surprised to learn that <em>Don’t Breathe</em> shot ProRes instead of ARRIRAW despite having a listed production budget of $10 million. At what budget level do you think you could spring for raw and a 4K DI? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/franknada/\">franknada</a></strong><br/>\nProRes is a favorite simply because the Alexa can record that internally. We wanted to avoid using a bulky external recorder. Those things suck, and we were in very tight quarters. I’ll do 4K when it can be recorded without a bunch of extra gear (happening as we speak) and when it looks better than other options. A lot of DPs are perfecting the art of degrading the image now that the resolution race is on! Also, fuck anything other than 24fps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was your experience of getting <em>Green Room</em> into as many theaters as possible and do you think it bodes well for other directors releasing edgy horror/thriller stuff wide in future? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/she_esh/\">Steven Wallace</a></strong><br/>\nI was grateful to release <em>Green Room</em> across the world with many distribution partners, but I know it could’ve done better at the box office. Tough to gauge exactly what the circumstances were, but the film tested very highly with audiences compared to other indie horror/thrillers but didn’t perform as well. But I do think it’s a good time for indie horror, it’s just a matter of how much marketing will be done on the film’s behalf. I wish I didn’t have to worry about terms of distribution, but it’s certainly part of the overall picture so it’s good to be informed. My long game is to build a library of films that have a long life, that will be discovered by film nerds for decades to come, and that will generate revenue for my partners over the long term. When you chase what’s hot or design films to fit a market model, quality and originality can suffer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your desert island band?</strong><br/>\nBlack Sabbath.</p>\n\n<h2>ON STYLE, INFLUENCES AND PROCESS…</h2>\n\n<p><strong>When did you know you wanted to make films? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/donismysurname/\">Don</a></strong><br/>\nI knew the day I got my hands on a camera in 1984!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you begin as a director, what did you do to start and how would you recommend others to start based on your beginnings? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/dawsbear/\">Dawson Roberts</a></strong><br/>\nI started in my backyard taking photos of dioramas I built (and often destroyed). I fell in love with the camera the first time I had access to one. I explored VHS and Super-8, makeup effects, prop building from an early age. I found a bunch of likeminded film nerds in my hometown and we spent our youth making videos for class and for our own amusement.</p>\n\n</p><p>I applied to NYU’s undergraduate film school (Tisch School of the Arts) and was accepted. Had a blast in college and maintained an academic scholarship. Thought I’d be discovered out of film school but spent years doing P.A. work instead. Always plotting with my friends, but making a living in advertising. Saved money. Blew it on a short film. Moved from P.A. to cameraman. Then to small-scale directing gigs. Saved money. Blew it on <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/murder-party/\">Murder Party</a></em>. Lost money. Went back to advertising, but lost traction. Went back to camera work and shooting indie features. Saved money. Waited. Bought an apartment. Had a couple of kids. Saved money. Blew it on <em>Blue Ruin</em>. Whew. Finally paid off.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[5]--><small><em>Macon Blair in Blue Ruin</em></small></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you create a rapport with cast and crew on set? Do you have a ritual before getting on set? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/ethanoneill/\">ethanoneill</a></strong><br/>\nI cast actors and hire crew that are talented and enthusiastic about the story we’re telling. I’m honest with everyone and try to be encouraging, and that usually creates reciprocity and a great rapport on set. I also try to hide my self-doubt and crippling fear of failure for at least the first week of shooting. No rituals yet, I’m still working on simply relaxing a bit and letting myself enjoy the experience of production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you approach storyboarding in preparation for shooting your films? You strike me as a detailed visual director who would storyboard every shot of his films for control, is this the case? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/charles_w/\">Charles Wiggins</a></strong><br/>\nI do indeed start out with the intent of storyboarding every frame of a film before production, but usually end up getting through about 30–40% before I’m bogged down with logistics related to casting, budgeting and scheduling. On <em>Green Room</em>, we realized that it would be useless to storyboard all the close-quarters interiors backstage, as the action and visual design needed to come from rehearsals and blocking with actors, not particular frames. But we storyboarded the first 15 minutes of the film more or less shot for shot. Same with <em>Blue Ruin</em>—I meticulously storyboarded the first 30 minutes of the film on my iPad and the rest was chicken-scratch with stick figures in a spiral notebook.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How and when did you know that making movies was what you really wanted to do? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/santlucas/\">Lucas Santana</a></strong><br/>\nMy mom did educational research and had access to early VHS camcorders (1984). She brought one home from work over the weekend for me to play around with and I was hooked. Took a while to officially become a filmmaker, but it’s always been my since the age of eight.</p>\n\n<h2>ON GENRE…</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Do you see yourself as a horror director?</strong><br/>\nI’m happy to let others classify my work into specific genres, but no, I do not see myself as a ‘horror director’.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you ever get the impulse to embark on a project entirely different from your previous films (like a sci-fi or a romance) or do you think that the themes and ideas you’ve explored so far in your career are inspirations you’ll continue to draw from? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/cham/\">Cham</a></strong><br/>\nI absolutely want to branch out, but genre films are too damn fun to make and offer the most exciting visual opportunities. I actually started out making comedies and hope to explore many different types of films throughout my career.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s a genre you always wanted to tackle? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/jkb1626/\">Joshua Brown</a></strong><br/>\nBIG ACTION.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you tackle other film genres where there is no suspense aspect? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/dynamitefilms/\">DynamiteFilms</a></strong><br/>\nYes, if I can tell the story visually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you plan on sticking with horror thrillers or can you imagine straying into other genres? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/agnis/\">Agnis</a></strong><br/>\nI will eventually make a film my whole family can watch!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your films take on a lot of genre elements, especially as far as thriller, crime and dark comedy go. Do you have any plans to consider other film genres as you continue to create movies? Thanks for doing this Q&amp;A! —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/loganpmiddleton/\">Logan Middleton</a></strong><br/>\nMy pleasure! Yes, my greatest pleasure is to mix up genres and blur the lines between them. I’ll let them be marketed and categorized by the distributors, but it’s fun to ignore all that shit when I’m making a film!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you consider making a big-budget blockbuster with a finished script or would you rather stick to the writer-director role of smaller arthouse-exploitation movies with more freedom? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/moviebrayne/\">Moviebrayne</a></strong><br/>\nOh hell yes. The dream is to receive awesome, completed screenplays on a silver platter and make them into movies every year. But the marketplace is tough and I will plan on self-generating scripts at various budget levels to maintain more control over the business side as well as artistic freedom.</p>\n\n<h2>ON VIOLENCE &amp; R RATINGS…</h2>\n\n<p><strong>The way you film violence, that reality and that frailty combined, which movie or director inspired your style of filming? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/waldo/\">Waldo</a></strong><br/>\nI was obsessed with special effects makeup from a very early age. Even before that, I was into fine-scale modeling and building dioramas. It’s always about creating (or recreating) something that sells a certain authenticity. So I was into the craft of violence on film from the beginning, as that offered the most tactile approach to filmmaking and delivered the most heightened experience for viewers. Biggest influences would be Peter Jackson (for over-the-top gore), the Coen brothers (for their singular mix of realism/comedy/tragedy in their portrayal of violence) and Martin Scorsese, especially <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/taxi-driver/\">Taxi Driver</a></em>, for the awkward and brutal small-scale effects that I emulate in my films.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you balance the level of violence in your films with your personal feelings towards violence, i.e. how do you balance the entertainment audience get from seeing violence with the impact (moral, visceral or otherwise) you want said violence to have? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/vadermccandless/\">Caleb McCandless</a></strong><br/>\nCinematic violence is certainly something I gravitate towards and I’m not exactly sure why. It has to do with the shock and exhilaration of a heightened experience and life-or-death stakes. For me violence has to enhance the story emotionally. It has to have a charge behind it or else it’s not at all appealing to me. If violence makes the audience clap, I hope it means they’re glad somebody else has survived. If the audience is disgusted by violence, that’s okay too. As long as they’re along for the ride.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is it about violence (in movies) that you find engaging? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/deepbluefunk/\">deepbluefunk</a></strong><br/>\nSimply, the art and craft of pulling off gags.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you create such great tension from such simplicity? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/alextromagnetic/\">Alex Gidley</a></strong><br/>\nNot exactly sure, but I focus on ‘method writing’. Really putting myself into various characters and trying to inject very human thoughts, impulses and vulnerabilities. This leads to unpredictability and instability in the conflicts I explore. Once we deviate from the standard screenplay rules, it gets a lot more fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What tricks have you found for building tension so effectively? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/jonnixfilm/\">Jon Nix</a></strong><br/>\nA key element to building tension is knowing how to play with the concept of information deprivation, as it applies to both the characters and the audience. Knowing (or not knowing) something can be absolutely terrifying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In <em>Blue Ruin</em> and <em>Green Room</em>, you subvert expectations a lot, which makes me wonder how you feel about clichés? It seems to be something you put great effort into avoiding. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/robtarded/\">Robtarded</a></strong><br/>\nI’ll always try to explore new narrative territory, but if I try too hard to subvert expectations my efforts fail. I’m big into ‘invisible structure’ wherein I bring in visual or thematic set-ups/payoffs, but refuse to do it through contrived action or dialogue. I allow myself to be impulsive when I write and to complicate things to a point of no solution—that’s usually when characters die in my scripts, when I fail as a writer to find them a way out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The violence in your films almost always arrives with little of the contrived cinematic fanfare we’re used to. Instead it hits with a sudden blunt-force trauma that feels far more realistic and sickening. Do you feel that it is a responsibility of the filmmaker to paint violence in such an unglamorous and disturbing way, or is it solely an artistic preference? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/david_cassette/\">David</a></strong><br/>\nA little bit of both. I try not to let real-life violence affect my storytelling as an artist, but I can’t help but be aware of what goes on beyond the page of my script. I love me a gore-fest but in my recent work, I only want violence in my films that I believe needs to be there. Sloppy, disturbing and awkward violence is naturally what I gravitate towards.</p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[6]--><small><em>Imogen Poots in Green Room</em></small></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve also successfully blended gruesome horror elements with a sort of understated, slightly gothic Americana-type tone. Do you intend to continue in this direction of portraying exploitation-influenced stories in more grounded and artful ways than we’re used to or do you have other cinematic ambitions? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/david_cassette/\">David</a></strong><br/>\nYes! For now ‘grounded and artful’ is what I’m feeling. Big action would be a dream, but there’s not a lot of opportunities out there to do it right. <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/sicario-2015/\">Sicario</a></em> is a rare exception. Comedy and sci-fi aren’t off the table either, as long as I can tell those stories in a ‘grounded and artful’ way!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Green Room</em> is one of the most fantastically violent movies I’ve ever seen and I know many people who have had a difficult time watching it. As a creator of hyper-violent movies, I want to know if there are any movies that portray violence in a way that you find difficult to watch? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/cinemole/\">Alistair Ryder</a></strong><br/>\nYes. I’ve got a problem with some films out there. No judgement, just my preference as an audience member. I hate when guns are pointed at infants or children who are not old enough to ‘consent’ to being part of on-screen violence. It just creeps me out. I’ve also grown softer with age and fatherhood, so that’s on me. Julia Bloch (my editor) and I had a hard time in the edit room during some of the gnarly scenes in <em>Green Room</em> too, so my work is included in the ‘too difficult to watch’ category!</p>\n\n</p><p><strong>I absolutely loved <em>Green Room</em> when I first saw it but I was surprised by the 18 certificate it got in the UK. What has been your history on film ratings on your projects and also what is your opinion on film ratings in general? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/dubscheckem/\">Aaron Murray</a></strong><br/><em>Murder Party</em> wasn’t rated because it didn’t get a theatrical release. <em>Blue Ruin</em> was R and that seemed fine. <em>Green Room</em> also received an R and that surprised me a bit—I didn’t have to cut a frame for the U.S. release! As for other countries, I respect the cultural preferences native to their markets and don’t get too much in the way. I did some slight trims on <em>Green Room</em> for a European territory to get a favorable rating. I didn’t do anything I felt altered my artistic intentions but I was happy to trim a few frames of gore here or there if it meant a wider release. So I don’t think too much about ratings, but I do like cussing and smoking and action and blood and sex in my cinema.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><strong>Less a question and more of a story related to when I saw <em>Green Room</em>. I went to an advanced screening here in the UK a week or so before its official release, very much looking forward to it after previously watching <em>Blue Ruin</em> on Netflix and adoring it. What I wasn’t prepared for was my unexpectedly squeamish reaction to the moment the violence was really kicked up a notch (masterfully done by the way!), and the next thing I knew, I woke up in my seat in a cold sweat. A squeamish feeling had become a full-on passing out moment, much to my embarrassment and surprise.</strong></p><p>\n\n</p><p><strong>Anyway, since I’m not normally the squeamish type, I thought I ought to go see the doctor about this. I explained that I was watching a film that got particularly violent and it perhaps caught me off-guard, and maybe that’s why I passed out. He wasn’t convinced, and sent me for the full gamut of cardiology tests and revoked my driving licence for a few months while waiting for all the results. But just the other day, I heard that all my results came back normal, I can drive again, and the probable diagnosis: your film!</strong></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>So now that I’m apparently fit as a fiddle, I’m hoping to finally watch the film from the comfort of my living room this weekend (and make it all the way through this time). Wish me luck! —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/technogoat/\">Andrew Craddock</a></strong><br/>\nAndrew! Sorry to hear <em>Green Room</em> racked up some medical bills and deprived you of your driving privileges. Dare I say I’m flattered? Regardless, I’m happy to know you’re back in top shape and hope the home viewing goes better than the theatrical. Be sure to properly hydrate and surround yourself with pillows just in case!</p>\n\n<h2>ON TRILOGIES…</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Will you follow the current naming conventions of your last two films? Will it be your own <em>Three Colors</em> trilogy? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/raggedyryan/\">Ryan</a></strong><br/>\nThe colors in the titles of my last two films was a coincidence. The concept and title for <em>Green Room</em> actually predated <em>Blue Ruin</em>. However, now that there’s so much talk about it I feel obligated to one day complete a Color Trilogy. Just for shits and giggles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think your three movies make a sort of trilogy of improvised, unfit killers. If this is true, do you consider this “theme” over, and if so, what are you up to? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/cober/\">cober</a></strong><br/>\nThat is a keen observation. I’m not exclusive to inept protagonists, but I seem to always gravitate there, don’t I? I doubt it’s over. I like putting regular people way out of their depth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hey dude I’m colorblind can you change your movie titles? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mezza/\">Mezzy</a></strong><br/>\nWorkin’ on it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has anyone ever gotten confused and thought you directed <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/red-state/\">Red State</a></em>? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/jtmalone/\">Justin Malone</a></strong><br/>\nNot to my knowledge.</p>\n\n<h2>ON CROWD FUNDING…</h2>\n\n<!--figure[7]--><p><strong>I was one of those who threw a little cash at your Kickstarter for <em>Blue Ruin</em>.

It was a totally positive experience. I might even do it again if it means the difference between creative freedom or lack thereof. We needed the Kickstarter support to fill a gap in our cash reserves (I had my American Express ready to rock but the payroll company required crew payments to be in cash). Also, having hundreds of supporters behind the film meant we had to deliver something worthwhile. I’d much rather answer to friends and fans than to studio executives!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you give any advice to low-budget filmmakers trying to gain funding through Kickstarter? <em>Blue Ruin</em> is an inspiration to all of us, but it never would have gone into production without your successful Kickstarter campaign. How did you pull it off? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/ford_on_film/\">Harry J. Ford</a></strong><br/>\nWe put a lot into our campaign. We shot a camera test, provided concept art and photo references, produced a testimonial video and, most importantly, didn’t ask for anything more than we’d do ourselves. We put <em>all</em> of our cash in the film, and so were literally asking for a kickstart to make it a reality, not just a bunch of soft money we’d spend without risking our own equity. I will say it took forever to deliver the rewards. The film was a success, but that took up so much time and energy the Kickstarter rewards couldn’t be shipped until after our official release—which was almost a year after the premiere! Next time I’ll simplify the rewards.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Blue Ruin</em> has been such a prime example of how Kickstarter and crowdfunding can help create a fantastic film. How was the process of creating a movie through crowd funding and do you encourage others to follow this model? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/freddofett/\">Devin Warner</a></strong><br/>\nDo whatever it takes to make it happen. There’s always a trade-off. We put a lot of time and energy into the Kickstarter campaign, but that took lots of attention away from me prepping the film itself!</p>\n\n<h2>ON <em>MURDER PARTY</em> AND WHAT’S NEXT…</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How did you pull off the art show massacre scene in <em>Murder Party</em>? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/thatreviewerguy/\">Josh Rosenthal</a></strong><br/>\nWe wrote and shot the first two acts of <em>Murder Party</em> in the winter of 2006. We went back to our day jobs and I wrote the third act, waiting until the spring to actually shoot it. The art show massacre was the big set-piece finale, so we just put out a call for extras, secured a location and got as many of our friends as possible to show up. We had a great production designer who worked her ass off and transformed the warehouse space. Then we just had a big-ass dance party and murdered a lot of people. I was terrified to shoot the gallery space massacre because it was with a bunch of non-professional actors. I believe I was so sure it would be a disaster that I went to the back alley outside of location and cried. My wife (and producer) got me back in the game and we shot a shit ton of coverage to make up for my lack of craft. But the final chainsaw death scene put a smile back on my face—that was some rad makeup effects by my buddy and cast member Paul Goldblatt.</p>\n\n<!--figure[8]--></p><p><strong>Many of us on Letterboxd are big fans of your debut <em>Murder Party</em>, yet in at least some interviews you seem to avoid mentioning this earlier film. How do you feel about <em>Murder Party</em> and do you think you might return to the genre of “horror comedy” again at some point? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/fatpie42/\">fatpie42</a></strong><br/><em>Murder Party</em> was something I temporarily shunned to redefine my filmmaking ‘brand’. It was a fun, sleazy horror comedy shot on standard-definition video back in 2006 with a cast of high school buddies. But as we were positioning <em>Blue Ruin</em> six years later—a stark revenge film that was aiming for prestige film festivals—Macon and I decided to not mention our previous feature. We wanted to be taken seriously by actors, financiers and distributors.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>We used our friend’s company, <a href=\"http://www.filmscience.com\">filmscience</a>, to launch <em>Blue Ruin</em> and the ‘re-branding’ fooled everyone. I was now the cinematographer of Matthew Porterfield films, Macon was a great new discovery and filmscience was associated primarily with high-brow Kelly Reichardt films! Artsy! That’s a trick we used from years of working in advertising. So it worked. But now that we’ve established ourselves as filmmakers, we are allowed to talk about <em>Murder Party</em> again.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>While I cringe at some of the technical deficiencies, I love that film dearly and find it a precious archive of a group of friends making their first feature and having a shit ton of fun doing it. Also, the ‘MacGyver in the utility closet’ gag will surely go down as one of the proudest cinematic moments in my career. I would happily revisit the horror/comedy genre down the line.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><strong>How is <em>Hold the Dark</em> coming along? And how faithful will your adaptation of it be? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/robbystock/\">Robert Stockstill</a></strong><br/><em>Hold The Dark</em> is coming along, but it’s a tough one to get off the ground. It’s truly epic in scope and Macon’s adaptation is both faithful and cinematically streamlined.

Will be a year or three, but I’ll do it!</p>\n\n<h2>ON FILMMAKING AND CRITICISM…</h2>\n\n<p><strong>I edit corporate videos for a living, and all of your films give me hope that there’s something that I can aspire to other than talking heads. I learned on Avid, switched to FCP 7, and now use Premiere almost exclusively. Do you have a favorite? Which NLE(s) did you use on your films? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/bagofbeef/\">bagofbeef</a></strong><br/>\nWe edited <em>Blue Ruin</em> on a FCP 7 system. I have not upgraded because I don’t like change. Julia, my editor is more of an Avid person, so we edited <em>Green Room</em> on Avid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How many takes do you do? A few, like an Old Hollywood director? 40 like Noah Baumbach? 200+ like Kubrick? And which number take do you tend to prefer? Do your editors listen? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lancelubelski/\">Lanny</a></strong><br/>\nTakes vary. Always at least two—I like to have a choice. Rarely more than six takes on <em>Blue Ruin</em>. <em>Green Room</em> was the most coverage I’ve ever done because of the nature of the eight-person ensemble work. But the inserts are killer. Sometimes 13 to 15 takes to get a knife or a gun to land in the right place in sharp focus! I’d need to check the camera reports, but I don’t think I’ve ever hit 20 takes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Describe your interactions with your DP please, and advice for a writer-director getting started in the industry? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lancelubelski/\">Lanny</a></strong><br/>\nLike great actors, finding great DPs is all about the casting process. Once you find the right collaborator, who can contribute artistically but not try too hard to put their personal stamp on your movie, who is professional and kind and has a great reputation, then the interactions are collaborative and effortless.</p>\n\n</p><p>My advice for getting started is simply to keep going. We all find our own path, the key is to be ready to deviate (with a different crew position or a day job that is within or peripheral to the industry) but never get off the path altogether. I failed repeatedly to break in—until I finally did. But I focused as much on building a family and owning a home as I did filmmaking. The discipline is not just knowing when to go ‘all in’ and make a movie, it’s also knowing when to sit out and not make a movie.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Your settings inspire me. <em>Blue Ruin</em>’s quiet, poignant, but wild Shenandoah backdrop and <em>Green Room</em>’s northwestern anonymity. How do these places complete your storytelling? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/kyliebritt/\">Kylie B(uscemi)</a></strong><br/>\nThanks! Setting is a huge part of the stories I tell. Environment is key to building atmosphere and mood when you’re telling a story with as few words as possible. It’s often the most relatable character in my films! I often start with a place in mind and build the story from there, as I did with <em>Blue Ruin</em>, which was my ‘Untitled Beach Bum Project’ before I settled on a title.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you don’t have a bankable hook (i.e. previous reputable film, recognizable actor, etc.) how do you get someone to care about your feature film—pitch or final product? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/ryanbrown/\">Ryan Martin Brown</a></strong><br/>\nI have no idea. I never got anyone to care until I had finished films to present. People break through in all kinds of different ways, but I only broke through after building and funding my films from the ground up. <em>Green Room</em> is the first film I sold at a script level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Macon Blair is a fantastic and exciting actor whom I have discovered through your films. Do you write with his “voice” in mind for the character and how it will affect the story? Do you collaborate at all with him when developing scripts? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/scrumblebunny/\">Slappy McGee</a></strong><br/>\nMacon is a champion. He is certainly my muse. <em>Green Room</em> (conceived of a decade ago) was supposed to be for him to star in, but he got too old for that shit by the time we got it made. Macon is the first person to read my scripts. His notes are amazing. He’s also wrapping up his first feature that he wrote and directed. It’s going to be a lot of fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I’m someone who has written a fairly negative review of your film and was even featured in the Letterboxd newsletter for giving <em>Blue Ruin</em> a half star. How seriously do you believe a director should take criticism and how should they respond to it? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/anythingplusmor/\">Paul Attard</a></strong><br/>\nThat’s a tough one. I remember negative reviews far more than positive ones. A <em>director</em> should not take reviews too seriously and must ultimately acknowledge that their work is in the public sphere, subject to and vulnerable to all that lay eyes on it. But as a <em>person</em>, negative reviews certainly have a negative effect.</p>\n\n</p><p>It’s just about training yourself as an artist not to engage (which I’ve done in the past and always regret). I never have beefs with negative reactions to my work (I’ve got plenty of issues with my own films), but I do get ticked off, and must resist responding, when a reviewer makes incorrect assumptions, assigns false intentions, or somehow tries to ‘diagnose’ what didn’t work behind the scenes. That gets frustrating because people break the barrier of criticism (where anything goes) and start invading the real world of deal making, production, scheduling, casting, etc., which reviewers often know little or nothing about.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>But I’m lucky, my films have generally been warmly received. I can be a harsh critic myself, but I don’t publicly criticize films because I’m not comfortable with that. I loathe the anonymity of the Twittersphere and the feedback loop of negativity it generates (moreso with politics).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Also, it’s all a matter of taste, so it’s hard to argue back and forth productively. You, for instance, can despise my films. And the sensitive artist inside me will be deeply saddened. I can in turn lessen my pain by searching your reviews and dismissing your opinion because you liked <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/dirty-grandpa/\"><em>Dirty Grandpa</em> </a> more than <em>Green Room</em>, which proves you’re a tool. Or maybe you’re totally not a tool and I’m the tool and <em>Dirty Grandpa</em> is objectively better? It’s pointless, of course, and it’s why I don’t publicly denounce films (except <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/killer-nerd/\">Killer Nerd</a></em>, which was the first movie I saw shot on standard definition video and I hate it forever for that).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Ultimately, it’s best if I stop checking Rotten Tomatoes and looking at snarky comments in IMDB message boards, but it’s hard to resist. I should simply take comfort in knowing that the films you’ve assigned low ratings to and reviewed with harsh words somehow brought me to Cannes, Toronto and Sundance twice! And that’s not to brag. It’s simply to say “to each their own” and “what the fuck am I doing defending myself to a stranger that is merely expressing their opinion?!”. While your review of <em>Green Room</em> incorrectly diagnoses my personal intentions, which is annoying, I can’t argue when you declare the film “a pointless waste of my time”. It certainly was for you. And at least we can both agree on one thing: <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/hard-target/\">Hard Target</a></em> is rad.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What would you consider the biggest problem with the modern film industry? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/j_kashmir/\">Johnny Kashmir</a></strong><br/>\nI’m learning new problems daily. I will get back with a diagnosis shortly. In the meantime, there’s lots wrong with the industry, but plenty that is new and exciting to take advantage or. It’s more a matter of matchmaking the project with the financing model. There are great low-budget, non-union models, there are great domestic indie models, foreign pre-sales modes, etc. When projects are assigned the wrong model, it can be a disaster. I’m learning that lesson now, but will strive to be like <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/director/steven-soderbergh/\">Steven Soderbergh</a>, who has navigated the micro-indie world, the star-studded studio world, and the auteur-driven TV world like no other.</p>\n\n<h2>ON ACTORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE&hellip;</h2>\n\n<p><strong>I discovered your films through Netflix and Blu-ray because of a lack of theater distribution in my area. Do you prefer for your films to be viewed in a theater or do you think the effect is the same regardless of the way you watch it? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/r6yt/\">Josh Davenport</a></strong><br/>\nI always prefer my films to be viewed on the big screen. Got no problem with a widescreen TV and dope surround sound system either, but I cringe knowing how many people watch films on laptops or cell phones. But, as long as they pay for it, I’m grateful for the support no matter the viewing conditions, because it means they’re helping me make the next one!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could work with any actor/actress living or dead, who would you want to work with? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/esplover/\">Coalton Ross</a></strong><br/>\nGene Hackman. He’s retired, but he’s my fave.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marry one, fuck one, kill one: Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/rrhodgson/\">rrhodgson</a></strong><br/>\nHaven’t you seen my films? Nobody gets married. Very little fucking. EVERYBODY DIES.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Cramps or The Misfits? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/shakenjake/\">Jake O’Brien</a></strong><br/>\nThe Misfits, for sure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you like to hang out sometime? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/serrano/\">Serrano</a></strong><br/>\nI’m not sure how I feel about that question, Serrano. I’m going to abstain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will you marry me? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/otherground/\">Underground Opera Singer</a></strong><br/>\nI am already happily married with three children. But thanks for asking!</p>\n\n<p><strong>D.C. in the ’80s is probably my favorite hardcore scene and some of my favorite music of all time came out of there. What’s the wildest show you ever played/went to and who was your favorite band to see back then? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/newjerseynoise/\">James</a></strong><br/>\nI saw lots of shows and they’ve blurred together. Wildest show was when I was assaulted in the pit from out of nowhere. Dude flailed his arms at me, closed fists, I went to the ground and he kicked me. So I got up.</p>\n\n</p><p>Afterward, I learned he was actually a fan of my band, but didn’t recognize me. No hard feelings. I missed the ’80s hardcore scene in D.C. because I was just skateboarding around the Virginia suburbs but caught some great shows in the mid/late ’90s. Cro-Mags, Gut Instinct (reunion), but I was most honored to see the Bad Brains play with their original line-up (reunion show).</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the worst conversation you’ve ever had with someone about your movies? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/jakebitesdog/\">Jake Kwiatkowski</a></strong><br/>\nIt was with the financiers of <em>Green Room</em>, regarding script notes we didn’t agree on. Also, when people think they’re being ‘refreshingly honest’ and come up to you and share at length why they didn’t like your film. That’s awkward as hell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just wondering, have you tried those Swedish fish Oreos yet? They’re friggin’ gnarly, dude. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/sidneylumetsuxx/\">SidneyLumetSuxx</a></strong><br/>\nHey! I have not. I’m more into pastries and Chubby Hubby, not so much the sweet gelatinous candy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite horror film? What is your favorite metal album? What are your thoughts on (cishet) male privilege? I’m serious about the male privilege question, though! —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/remote/\">alien brain</a></strong><br/>\nFavorite horror: <em><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-thing/\">The Thing</a></em> (1982).</p>\n\n</p><p>Man, can’t name just one album without further contemplation, but it’d be from Sabbath (Ozzy years) or Slayer (prior to <em>Divine Intervention</em>).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Male/white privilege is a real thing. Talking about it can bring about division and backlash, but my brief thoughts are the following: white men admitting they have an unfair advantage does not negate all the energy and sacrifice they put into building a career or creating opportunities. Breaking through professional or economic barriers is always difficult, so some white men think they’re being unfairly attacked by the very concept of ‘privilege’ because they’re struggling to pay the mortgage or keep themselves or their families afloat.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>But acknowledging that women or people of color have an even harder time is important. And it doesn’t take anything away from white males. It doesn’t negate their hard work, or make them love their Mommy or Daddy any less. Or belittle the entrepreneurial spirit of their great grandparents that emigrated from Europe and built something from nothing.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>I’m a white male and I’m not going to stop pursuing filmmaking or earning an income for my family because I have benefitted from an unfair advantage. But I sure as shit will acknowledge not only my privilege, but the clear disadvantage women and people of color have in my industry (and the world at large, of course). There’s no ‘case’ to be made. Institutional racism and sexism are demonstrable things. It can be proven with wage gaps, statistics on incarceration and a general understanding of recent history.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>I could go on, but I’ll just say that yes, it’s a thing, and the first step is to acknowledge it. As a father of three daughters and the husband of a person of color, I plan on doing my part to help level the playing field going forward. Wait, I thought this was a Q&amp;A for horror nerds!</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Predictions for the American League in this year’s playoffs? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/cognacinsomniac/\">Steve K</a></strong><br/>\nNo sports for me. Was into UFC until the PPVs exceeded the $40 range.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you remember being given a short script by a nervous young fellow at the <em>Green Room</em> premier at Regal Union Square? That was me. Did you read it? (I fully expected you not to have, I’m just curious.) —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/alex_berg/\">Alex Berg</a></strong><br/>\nAlex! So sorry. I had your script in my office for a while but I lost track of where it went. I’m currently scrambling, trying to put my next project together and reading scripts that will decide my near-term fate and financial future. I apologize for dropping the ball. Please forgive me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does one have to do to be an intern on your next film? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lucas_neufeld/\">Lucas Neufeld (therewillbefilm)</a></strong><br/>\nTo be determined. It often depends on where we shoot (local hires only) and usually comes through the production office.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assuming Picard will be ranked first, rank the rest of the Star Trek captains. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/aaronthec/\">Aaron C</a></strong><br/>\nI don’t watch <em>Star Trek</em> enough to answer with any authority.

I’m a fan of the site, and the staff are very kind and true fans of film!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is your surname pronounced Saul-knee-ay or Saul-kneer?

Big fan of James Ellroy and George Pelecanos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Top four favorite albums, go! —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/jackho/\">Jackho</a></strong><br/>\nBlack Sabbath ‘Paranoid’, AC/DC ‘Back in Black’, Talking Heads ‘Stop Making Sense’, and some other shit I can’t think of.

I was a fan of his work and was delighted to call him a friend after our collaboration on <em>Green Room</em>. As far as thoughts, I tried to sum them up <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2016/06/green-room-director-anton-yelchin-dead-jeremy-saulnier-1201690466/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could you share a favorite moment you had while working with Anton Yelchin? —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/brad_beatson/\">Brad Beatson</a></strong><br/>\nThat’s a tough one. Now that he’s passed I cherish every single moment we were together. The shoot was tough, but we formed a strong bond. I loved watching him work. He was so charming and the physicality and charisma Anton brought carried his character through the film—I certainly didn’t give him much in the way of monologues and traditional ‘character arcs’. When I was in L.A. with him after the shoot, he drove me around town and bought me tacos. That’s a favorite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could you share a moment on set with Anton Yelchin? I think he was such an incredible actor, and his raw talent is so blisteringly, fiercely on display in <em>Green Room</em> in a way it had rarely been captured before then. Thank you for that. —<a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/ridleyscotch/\">Mike</a></strong><br/>\nThank you for that. Okay, here’s a moment I can recall. I was putting the actors through hell on set, especially Anton. We were deep into shooting the intense interior action scenes in the green room set. There were fire extinguishers going off, walls exploding, dust in the air, and blood spraying. Anton was having a tough time with all the atmosphere and dust floating in the air and was coughing fiercely.</p>\n\n</p><p>I offered to shut down production for a bit, or get rid of all the dust, but we were now shooting in continuity and Anton knew that the shots wouldn’t match if stopped mid-way through. So he took a minute and powered through the rest of the night. I felt terrible about it, but was astonished by his dedication to the craft, to the film, and to the cast and crew he didn’t want to let down. He was a beast, and he will be missed.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[9]--><small><em>Alia Shawkat, Anton Yelchin and Callum Turner in Green Room</em></small></p><p>\n\n</p>"

There’s also an In Your Watchlist option so that you can, for example, view a friend’s watchlist in this mode to see which films you both want to see.

Until now, for the purpose of ease and inclusion, everyone was referred to using the singular “they/their” in the Activity feed, e.g. “Gemma added <em>Paris is Burning</em> to their watchlist”.</p>\n\n</p><p>Now, you can go to your <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/settings/\">Settings</a> and choose a pronoun from the selection menu.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>\n\n</p><p>After consulting with some beloved Letterboxd members well-versed in the landscape of non-binary pronouns, we have introduced these additional options: <em>she/her</em>, <em>he/his</em>, <em>xe/xyr</em>, <em>ze/hir</em> and <em>ze/zir</em>. And we’ve included <em>it/its</em> for accounts that represent an organization, e.g. a podcast, film society or film festival.*</p><p>\n\n</p><p>We are proud to introduce this new feature during Pride month, and in light of recent, awful events this is one small way in which we can show our support.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>So, why have we added these options, given that we have never asked for your gender in your profile (and don’t intend to)? We always felt that gender wasn’t necessary to the platform, and we were happy that a person’s given name or username might be the only clue to their gender. Why should gender matter on Letterboxd, anyway? Isn’t it more fun to bust open time-worn assumptions about fan-boys and flick-chicks and the films and genres they like?</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Well… pronouns are important to people. More important than our office full of mostly white, cisgender dev types can possibly grasp. We know we are privileged to never have to worry that someone will use the wrong pronoun in reference to us; we can’t imagine how alienating or offensive it must be for someone who does. Language and the way we use it contributes to the violence and oppression that marginalized groups in our society experience.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>So we want to be positive and proactive about how you would like to appear in others’ activity feeds, and how you would like others to refer to you in comments. You should be able to legitimize who you are when you’re on Letterboxd. Using a member’s correct personal pronoun is one of the most basic ways of showing respect for their identity.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>From day one we have built Letterboxd as an inclusive, respectful social network based around one idea: love of film (in all its forms, we are not celluloid-binary)—so if all it takes is a bit of code at our end to honor your choice of pronoun, well, why not.</p><p>\n\n</p>"

Tell us about your camera team and your directives to them.</strong><br/>\nDF: We had a number of people shooting things in here. Yves joined us on our first trip to LA and shot lots of our covert stuff. Dylan shot things. I shot horribly from a coffee cup. My friend Billy from TV3 shot with me at an airport.</p>\n\n</p><p>Then there is beautiful Dom Fryer, our DP. He has an amazing eye. He’d force us to take time in each place to really capture it. While I was pressuring everyone to keep the story moving and meet more people, Dom made sure we captured things in such beautiful detail. He made this film what it is, with his cunning eye and framing. Each place we visit on this crazy road trip has a personality. You see it in a new way, because he sees things you don’t see. Dom does a thing that is so, so important: he listens. He knows when something being said is important, and he’s there to capture it. He also has a very gentle way with the talent. Everyone likes Dom. He is a calming voice in the middle of stress.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>DR: The bulk of what you see in the film was shot by Dom. By the time we got him on board we were at the stage of aiming to make a visually arresting film and the look was a key consideration and something Dom just made second nature.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>One of the most clandestine moments though—the studio stakeout—was shot by Yves Simard who brought a lot of great experience to the table. The night before that shoot we went to Walmart and picked up a few yards of black fabric because, although our vehicle was tinted, we’d still be visible from the outside normally. But putting the black fabric up all around the inside of the car made it impossible to see in—it was genius!</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>David, when was Dylan the most terrified during the shoot, and what’s he like when he’s scared?</strong><br/>\nDF: Dylan is actually an amazingly calm man most of the time. Logical, measured, smart. Just occasionally that falls away. But I think we were all scared at the same time, we just show it in different ways. I go very quiet and still, like what a mouse does when it’s scared. Dylan does what a cat does when it’s scared at the vet, and makes a bit of a fuss. He breathes heavily.</p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>\n\n</p><p><small><em>Above: Dylan Reeve</em></small></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>You both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNYiM8JSh2ZunRN62qSttEw\">submitted</a> to tickling in the service of the film (in exchange for an interview with a maker of tickling videos). What was that like?</strong><br/>\nDR: Awful. Terrible. The worst. Honestly, you think of tickling as something sort of fun and often quite annoying, and that’s true when you can get away or shout “stop it!” but when you’re restrained and unable to escape it becomes quite different mentally. You can’t protect yourself. I’ve joked that if he’d kept up another few minutes I’d have given Richard my passwords and pin numbers… it might not be a joke.</p>\n\n</p><p>DF: It’s painful. Being tickled when you can’t get away isn’t all that funny. You are laughing on the outside, but not in the inside.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Which of the two of you is more ticklish?</strong><br/>\nDF: I think Dylan? He had the most explosive laugh. I was tickled for 10 minutes, Dylan did two minutes. I don’t think Dylan could have done 10, he would have combusted.</p>\n\n</p><p>DR: Probably me. I don’t like to own that, but in all fairness it was probably me. I seemed to find it harder to get through our tickling session than David.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Your funny TV story about tickling competitions became a dark film about bullying. What’s your advice to bullies and people being bullied?</strong><br/>\nDF: Don’t bully. Understand that bullying comes from a place of insecurity, and try and get over that insecurity. Fight it. Be yourself. Don’t take it out on others. Bullying breeds more bullying. But we all know this. As humans it seems as if sometimes we just can’t resist. But try and fight it. Teach your kids not to bully. Don’t let the cycle start in the first place. Be kind.</p>\n\n</p><p>DR: What’s interesting, I think, is that if we think about it we are all bullies sometimes. Often we don’t even realize at the time. I’ve been trying a lot harder in the last couple of years to avoid that. To be a more positive voice overall.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we make the Internet a nicer place? (Or are we dreaming?)</strong><br/>\nDR: Be the change you want to see in the world… or internet. Right? We should just make sure our contributions online are the sort of thing we want to see more of.</p>\n\n</p><p>DF: We can control the way we act. Don’t engage with idiots online. I seriously believe: don’t feed the trolls. And again, be kind.</p><p>\n\n<iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTGifG6UFpI?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n</p>"

This approach was introduced in the app and represents more predictable behavior, especially for new members.</li>\n<li>You can now sort a collection of lists by the date they were created (and we’re planning to add list size as a sort option in the near future).</li>\n<li>We’ve added clearer messaging around Facebook sharing in the Connections tab of your <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/settings/\">Settings</a> screen.

      "body": "Hello fine people. Here’s a brief note regarding some changes we’ve made to the site over the past fortnight or so.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, usernames. Until recently, there was no way to change your username (other than by requesting a change via email). Over the past couple of weeks we’ve rolled out a new beta feature for Pro and Patron members that enables them to change their username in <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/settings/\">Settings</a>. In the interests of promoting consistency and transparency in your use of Letterboxd, we’re limiting the frequency with which you can change your username to once every 180 days. If you elect to change your username, your previous selection will be returned to the pool of available names for another member to register or claim, and any inbound links to your profile or content containing your old username will break (this doesn’t apply to <code>boxd.it</code> links which will correctly expand to include your new username). We’d love to hear from members who use this facility about any issues you encounter, and please note that during the beta period we will not be changing any usernames via email request.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we’ve made some improvements to our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/about/importing-data/\">importer</a>. It’s now smarter about matching films by original or alternative name, and director name(s) and release year (if provided in your import file) correctly assist in achieving a better match (technically they always did, but in most cases we didn’t consider enough films for these fields to have a meaningful effect).</p>\n\n<p>In case you missed them, other recent changes include the addition of visible ratings while editing lists, and the addition of deleted content to account exports (this includes items you’ve deleted and your entries for films we’ve removed from the site).</p>\n\n<p>We’ve also made a change to how we calculate the “This Year” total on your profile, to make it less confusing for new members: each individual film is counted once in your annual total to make it consistent with the “Films” total next to it. In other words, if you watch the same film twice in the current year, it counts once towards your “This Year” total, but as two entries in your Diary. We’re thinking about showing this in the app too.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/app/\">iPhone app</a>, we’ve submitted 1.0.2 to Apple for review. It resolves two remaining date-related bugs and adds a couple of additional features and views. Barring any problems, it will be in the App Store in the next few days.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, it’s with misty eyes that we bid farewell to the film-quote captcha on our account creation page. For a variety of reasons we’ve decided to retire it in favour of Google’s single-click solution.</p>"

The only section in which the aforementioned release window rule does not apply is “Ones to Watch”, which notes the highest rated films seen by a smaller number of members.</p>\n\n<h2>The Review</h2>\n\n<p>For 2015 we’ve given the three highest rated films a page each and added full-screen video backdrops—use a desktop computer for the best experience.

      "body": "<p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>\n\n</p><p>Crystal Moselle is taking a break from the edit suite when we reach her. She’s carrying a bit of burnout from the media attention and hyped excitement of the past few months. Her debut feature documentary as a director, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-wolfpack/\"><em>The Wolfpack</em></a>, which was crafted from around 500 hours of footage, scooped the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance this past January. The film is still doing the festival circuit and Magnolia Pictures released it in the US last month. Crystal and her documentary subjects, the Angulo brothers, have been talking ad nauseum about the film, rehashing the past when all they really, really want is to look forward.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>But it’s the Angulo brothers’ past that got her where she is today: in an edit suite, working on a new film with them. Crystal met Bhagavan, Govinda, Narayana, Mukunda, Krsna (who now calls himself Glenn) and Jagadesh (now Eddie) five years ago and began hanging out with them, before discovering sometime later that these young men were only just beginning to emerge from a life under lock-and-key on New York’s Lower East Side.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Essentially imprisoned in a high-rise housing project by their father, the Angulo boys found creative inspiration in watching films. Thousands upon thousands of films. <em>The Wolfpack</em> features fantastic VHS footage of the boys’ recreations of movies, from <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/reservoir-dogs/\"><em>Reservoir Dogs</em></a> to <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/\"><em>The Dark Knight</em></a>. Turns out, they’re not bad actors at all, particularly when it comes to <a href=\"https://tribecafilm.com/stories/the-wolfpack-robert-deniro-taxi-driver-goodfellas-remakes-impressions-video\">Robert De Niro</a>.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Describe for us the day you met the Angulo brothers. It’s such a wild story.</strong><br/>\nI think that I just—it’s like a feeling, you can’t describe it. I’m very inspired by meeting real people and creating a world around them. I did a lot of fashion films and a lot of short documentaries for <em>The New York Times</em>, but when they passed by me there was something about them that really intrigued me. I literally just ran after them down the street. It was wild. They were weaving through the crowd and I ran after them. We met at the crosswalk and I asked them where they’re from and they said Delancey Street and they asked me what I did and I said I was a filmmaker. They said ‘we’re interested in getting into the business of filmmaking’.</p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you introduce the camera to them, and how long after that did you visit their apartment?</strong><br/>\nI think right away I got my camera out and shot them in the park and hung out with them. I was really inspired by them and I wanted to help them with the filmmaking stuff and showed them my camera. Eventually they invited me into their home and it became this really natural thing between us. That’s how it started.</p>\n\n</p><p>I imagined I’d just film them making their short films and it [would] be a fun little character piece, but I uncovered so many complex layers and it really became a whole other film. There’s a lot of emotion and I felt like I had to be delicate with the situation once I really found out what was going on.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>At what point did you find out there was more to their family’s story?</strong><br/>\nIt was a year in before I found out what was really going on. I didn’t know anything about how their father was. I just knew they were home-schooled, they were creative, they loved movies. The way that they were so descriptive, it’s like nothing I’d ever seen before. It felt very different and I wanted to know what their story was. For me it was… I had a skill that they were interested in. That’s how it started and then eventually it turned into a documentary film.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Given their love of film, how much of your documentary were they involved in? Did they do any filming? We’re thinking of the scene where Susanne calls her mother for the first time, and another Halloween scene involving, er, a real fire in the middle of their living room.</strong><br/>\nMukunda filmed that scene with Susanne. And the scene where they’re running around and jumping around having a dance party, those are the scenes they filmed, and I was there for the rest of it. They definitely had nothing to do with the edit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the boys affect your love of film? What films did you watch or re-watch as a result of being around them?</strong><br/>\nWell I did re-watch <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/hearts-of-darkness-a-filmmakers-apocalypse/\"><em>Hearts of Darkness</em></a>, the documentary on <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/apocalypse-now/\"><em>Apocalypse Now</em></a>. That was really inspiring to me, to see how a director we all look up to as far as cinema is suffering for his art. I love the editing in <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-limey/\"><em>The Limey</em></a>.</p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it hard for you to talk about the film every day? There is so much interest in it that it seems like the publicity side must be exhausting.</strong><br/>\nWe’re all just at the point that… I’m extremely burnt out. We’ve been talking about this film all day, every day. But we’re all very happy about everything that’s happening. They’re starting a production company and I’m helping them with that. We’re also very much about moving forward and moving on.</p>\n\n</p>"

      "abstract": "",
      "body": "<p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>\n\n</p><p>When we reach Jabin Dickins, he’s on a barge in Morton Bay, Queensland, Australia, supervising special effects for the <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/\">next <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> film</a> (“For the record, JD is a pleasure to work with and a very funny man!” he tells us later).</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Jabin began his career as a special effects technician in New Zealand on the long-running fantasy series <em>Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</em> and <em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em>. His impressive credits since then include <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/black-hawk-down/\"><em>Black Hawk Down</em></a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-matrix-reloaded/\"><em>The Matrix Reloaded</em></a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/x-men-origins-wolverine/\"><em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em></a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-great-gatsby-2013/\"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a> and, of course, the reason we’re all here—<em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>But when Jabin sits down to watch a film, big ol’ action movies are the very last thing he wants to see&hellip;</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What were the early films that inspired your career in special effects?</strong><br/>\nI remember the first time I saw special effects being used, and what really got me hooked on it, was <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope/\"><em>Star Wars</em></a> and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/superman/\"><em>Superman</em></a>. I remember going to see them with my Grandpa and thinking “that’s what I wanna do”. But I’m actually not a massive action film fan! I’m much more into darker, Coen Brothers type stuff; it’s what I would choose to sit down and watch myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So if Michael Bay came calling, you would say&hellip; ?</strong><br/>\nYes. I would do anything! The reality is I do special effects. A lot of the films I work on I’m not particularly proud of as works of art!</p>\n\n</p><p><strong>What sorts of films do you like, then?</strong><br/><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/no-country-for-old-men/\"><em>No Country For Old Men</em></a> is one of my favorite films. <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/fargo/\"><em>Fargo</em></a>. I love the way the Coens shoot stuff. Visual storytelling is more of what I’m into than action. Dark films, like <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/pans-labyrinth/\"><em>Pan’s Labyrinth</em></a>. Visually dark and twisted films.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the art of explosions, and some of your favorite on-screen explosions.</strong><br/>\nAn explosion in a film doesn’t require a lot of prep and thought. A cheap and easy way to get one it is to put explosives in a big mortar pot and pour petrol on top and you’ve got a big, yellow fireball.</p>\n\n</p><p>But when I’m watching films I’m much more interested in debris and things flying around. Where you can see that somebody has put a lot more thought into it; when you can see people in the shot and you know they’re there for real.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>For instance, I think the best film for explosive special effects [is] <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/saving-private-ryan/\"><em>Saving Private Ryan</em></a>. When a bomb explodes on a beach it’s not meant to be a big fireball, it goes for debris and stuff everywhere and those are much more intensive to make. You dig a hole, put up to a ton of dirt and sand in it, and to my mind that sort of stuff is really good, when you see actors running through. You’re more in the moment. It looks great.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>I worked on <em>Black Hawk Down</em> and that was another one [where] we spent a lot of time making explosions that are debris-based. Buildings that get hit and break apart while people are standing around and you see all that stuff flying about. I think they look good.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>The first [live action] <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/transformers/\"><em>Transformers</em></a> film is one of my favorite films that mixes mechanical and digital special effects effectively. It’s really not my sort of film but the effects were amazing and I can watch something like that and I can learn from it. For me I found it hard to see where the real stuff stopped and the CG started. They’ve done a very good job.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><strong>We’ve been very polite so far, but please let’s talk about the explosions in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> now!</strong><br/><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/mad-max-fury-road/\"><em>Fury Road</em></a> was a fun thing to do just due to the fact that we were allowed to do stuff that looks more realistic. The big truck explosion was kind of fun. I’m not one to do big fireballs because I think they look stupid, but that was fun for us because it had every right to be a big explosion.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>We had the one shot, one crack at it. It had to work. For us to screw it up would be a massive expense. So we went and got another tanker that we could practice on, did lots and lots of testing, different mixes of explosives, then we’d show the team, go back and do some more testing.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>The explosion is one part of that whole gag, but a lot of the work for us was in turning the truck into a remote-controlled vehicle to make sure it’s safe. We put a small fuel tank in the truck to make sure it’s only got about 2 litres of diesel in there so if anything went wrong it would run out of fuel before too much damage was done. My main stress that day was a truck going AWOL at 60 to 70 kilometres an hour!</p><p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[2]--></p><p>\n\n</p><p>Obviously there’s no actor running along the top like you see in the film, but there were camera cars within 100 metres of the truck. A lot of thought went into it and we only had one chance. We tested and tested and tested until we got it right. We pulled it off and it looked amazing on the day.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you celebrate at the end of a successful effect?</strong><br/>\nYeah we do, we do. It is quite stressful leading up to all that stuff and to walk away and see something finished and done, it’s a good feeling. It looks good, no-one got hurt, they got what they wanted. I don’t feel it beforehand. I’m in the zone. But afterwards I can feel it. It’s a sense of relief more than anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can you say about the best 3D shot in the film—you know the one we mean?</strong><br/>\nThe 3D shot—that was a fantastic day! So when we crashed the vehicle that the Doof Warrior was on, we rolled the truck so it blocks the hole. That’s the first gag. Then we blow up the speakers. All of that shot was done for real except the guitar—that was a separate element. But the shot with all the speakers coming off, all that stuff flying to camera, that was all real.</p>\n\n</p><p>The good thing about doing stuff like that for real is: it looks real. You never know what’s going to happen. Whereas stuff made in the digital realm looks more choreographed, in a real crash you see all this stuff bouncing off, it looks totally real.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>But a lot of our work is not necessarily explosion-based. We were responsible for building the Polecats. I actually thought when we first had a meeting about all of that that we’d do it in CGI because it would be too dangerous. But George Miller wanted to do it for real so we did lots and lots and lots of testing. It was mildly terrifying to watch but successful in the end.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you reckon about George Miller?</strong><br/>\nHe’s cool. He’s pretty eccentric. I could see all the way through that he had a good vision. He’s got his own way of saying things and you just kind of have to learn that what [he’s] saying and what [he] wants are two different things. I enjoyed it. It’s definitely the most fun I’ve had making a film. We were in Namibia, which is an absolutely stunning place. It looks even more amazing when you’re there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Got any good special effects stories from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>?</strong><br/>\nThe strangest stuff for me was things like when Daisy was in the living room and there’s all the big curtains blowing through the room. That was Baz saying ‘I want the curtains to blow right across the room’. But the curtains weren’t long enough, so I went to wardrobe and said ‘you guys need to make me some curtains that are 30 foot long’. So they did, and on the other side of the curtains in the shot are a bunch of guys in blue overalls covered in grease making them billow and wave.</p>\n\n</p><p><!--figure[3]--></p><p>\n\n</p><p>And the same thing with the necklace and all the pearls coming down the hall. Baz said “I want him to rip it off her neck” and have all the pearls roll through the house. So we looked into it, and the necklace ends up being a two and a half-million dollar Tiffany necklace! I don’t think so! So we went and bought every pearl we could find. It’s like, let me do what I’ve gotta do. Things like that can be a little hard but at the same time it’s fun.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the toughest special effect to pull off?</strong><br/>\nUm… ooh… that’s an interesting question! Smoke is one of the toughest things to do. Everyone thinks smoke would be easy but good smoke is one of the hardest things to do and getting smoke to do what you want it to do is a big challenge. Even with our modern techniques it’s hard to make smoke work around people. If you get it right it’s amazing. If you get it wrong you get yelled at. That’s something I’ve sweated lots of blood on over the years. Everyone seems to think they can do it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the best thing about the job?</strong><br/>\nI never really know what I’m going to be doing. We are jacks of all trades. I’ve got a lot of guys I can lean on—engineering guys, hydraulics guys, everyone’s under our umbrella. It’s a mixed bag of weird and wonderful people. As much as I can never quite know what’s going to happen to me, I’ve got a great base of people I can call on.</p>\n\n</p><p>We’re constantly experimenting with things, trying different fuels. We test everything ad nauseum. I’m not going to take anything on set that’s going to put someone at risk. We’re always learning. You never know what’s going to work. It’s fun!</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there a lot of New Zealanders on set?</strong><br/>\nThere’s a lot of people out there doing well! The main stunties on <em>Mad Max</em> were Kiwis. A lot of us are from the Herc and Xena background. We certainly hold up our end in the world out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So do you love Guy Fawkes? (Ed’s note: Guy Fawkes’ Day is an annual fireworks celebration every 5 November, based on a failed political plot in England in 1605.)</strong><br/>\nI love Guy Fawkes! I do. Unfortunately in Australia they don’t celebrate it, which is kind of weird. My birthday is actually the 6th of November, the day after, so I used to celebrate my birthday all the time with fireworks. I’m a big fan, love it. I would be highly disappointed if they stopped it in New Zealand, but they probably will. But I’m a massive fan. Unsurprisingly. But having said that, I’m a bit of a chicken when it comes to that stuff because I know what it can do, so I tend to be the one hiding behind the car.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And even though you say action films aren’t your favorite, what would be your top five?</strong><br/><em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/raiders-of-the-lost-ark/\"><em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em></a>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner/\"><em>Blade Runner</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/apocalypse-now/\"><em>Apocalypse Now</em></a>. \nThere are of course so many amazing action films out there with great special effects, but these were all inspirational to me. Particularly <em>Star Wars</em>, blew my little mind back in the day! And I’m a massive fan of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. Probably as much knowing how hard it was for them to do it [given] the number of people they had, where they were, the day it was made. Back in the day it wasn’t so easy. That’s probably one of my favorite films of all time.</p>\n\n</p>"

      "abstract": "",
      "body": "<p><!--figure[1]--></p><p>Before <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/slow-west/\"><i>Slow West</i></a>, first time feature film director John Maclean had another life as the DJ/programmer in Scottish electro-indie outfit The Beta Band. That name sound familiar? You might recall the essential scene from <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/high-fidelity/\"><i>High Fidelity</i></a> in which John Cusack’s character, all indie swagger, puts on the song <i>Dry The Rain</i> by the Scottish newcomers, declaring: “I will now sell five copies of <i>The Three EPs</i> by The Beta Band”.</p><p>John—a graduate of Edinburgh Art School and The Royal College of Art in London—made many of his band’s music videos. He also directed two short films (<i>Man on a Motorcycle,</i> <i>Pitch Black Heist</i>) both starring Michael Fassbender, who joined him for <i>Slow West</i> as Silas, an elusive drifter.</p><p>When we asked John to reveal the films that formed him, he opened up about bullies, breasts and his massive vinyl collection of movie soundtracks.</p><p><p><b>What’s the first film you remember watching?</b><br/>\nMy first film going to the cinema? Well, my Dad used to take me. I remember seeing a few 70s and 80s westerns. Some <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-war-wagon/\">really dodgy stagecoach caper</a> with Kirk Douglas. Before that I suppose I was watching films on TV, like <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/tarzan-the-ape-man/\"><i>Tarzan</i></a> and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-rocket-man/\"><i>The Rocket Man</i></a>. I remember loving the original <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-amazing-spider-man-1977/\"><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></a> film. But the first big film was <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back/\"><i>The Empire Strikes Back</i></a> and there was no going back after that!</p><p><b>Didn’t you see <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope/\"><i>Star Wars</i></a> first?</b><br/>\nI was too young for when it came out but then I saw it with <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>. I suppose they were showing it in repeats with <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>.</p><p><b>What’s the first film you paid to see yourself?</b><br/>\nI think it might have been <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-karate-kid/\"><i>The Karate Kid</i></a> or <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-goonies/\"><i>The Goonies</i></a>.</p><p><b>You’re a musician as well as a director. What’s your favourite music documentary?</b><br/>\nI’m not really that into music films. I’ve got a real problem with biog films, you know, actors playing musicians. I kind of generally find them a bit of a dud genre. So instead I will say <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/performance/\"><i>Performance</i></a>, the film with Mick Jagger in it.</p><p><b>Well then, do you have a favourite film soundtrack?</b><br/>\nThere’s so many. Too many! I actually collect movie soundtracks. I’ve got about 2000 on vinyl, all film soundtracks. I could maybe do a Top 50. My favourite Ennio Morricone soundtrack is the one for <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/theorem/\"><i>Theorem</i></a>, the Pasolini film.</p></p><p><b>First film that gave you teenage feelings?</b><br/><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-karate-kid/\"><i>The Karate Kid</i></a>. Ha! I wanted to beat up the bullies. Do you mean those teenage feelings or&hellip; the other sort?</p><p><p><b>We were thinking more the other sort. Come on, you’re a Scot. Surely it would be <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/gregorys-girl/\"><i>Gregory’s Girl</i></a>?</b><br/>\nYeah, actually, <i>Gregory’s Girl</i>. It was such a huge film that, you know, everyone in my school used to walk around going “Bella Bella” and pulling your jumper into breast shapes. That’s just what we all did. And obviously Scotland’s a very football-loving country so it wins in both ways.</p><p><b>What about a film that stirred political feelings?</b><br/>\nIn a strange way I grew up loving films that were anti-military but entertaining, so I would say <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/robocop/\"><i>Robocop</i></a> and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/die-hard/\"><i>Die Hard</i></a> are films that shone a light on the military in a negative way. Both those films did that, but somehow managed to be gung-ho at the same time. They stirred up a feeling of the ridiculousness of violence and machines and police forces and guns.</p><p><b>Femme fatale?</b><br/>\nI would have to mebbe say Sharon Stone in <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/casino/\"><i>Casino</i></a>. She’s always quite the femme fatale. There’s so many again that it’s hard to specify just one. But, Sharon Stone, yeah.</p></p>"

      "body": "\n\n<p>From time to time we need to change our standard Terms of Use, which is the document that governs our relationship with you. Today we’re announcing a couple of changes in light of the API, our use of it on Film Fest Buzz, and to better clarify our policy in a couple of specific areas.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve set out the changes below. A full set of the new Terms and Conditions can be found <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/legal/terms-of-use/\">here</a>. Please have a read of these terms, which will automatically apply to your use of Letterboxd on and from today, 24 January 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The changes are:</p>\n\n<p>1. We’ve added a new clause 5, which reads:</p>\n\n<p><em>No spam or multiple accounts: You must not use the Website or encourage others to use the Website to create multiple accounts, deceive or mislead other users, disrupt discussions, game the Website’s mechanics, alter consensus, post spam or otherwise violate our community policy.</em></p>\n\n<p>We are making this change because we want to make clear to users that deceiving actions like posting spam and creating multiple accounts is unacceptable. This is considered a serious breach of community trust and will likely result in the cancellation of your account.</p>\n\n<p>2. We’ve amended the Intellectual Property clause (now clause 10, previously clause 9), which now reads:</p>\n\n<p><em>Intellectual property: You agree that we own all of the intellectual property rights in the Website. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual and sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, distribute and display (including for commercial purposes) on the Website and in other media any content or material that you post on the Website, and any name(s) and/or avatar under which you post such content.  Other than this right, we claim no intellectual property rights in relation to the information or content that you upload onto the Website. Any content you post to the Website should be original, and not infringe anyone else’s intellectual property rights. You warrant that you own or are authorised to use and publish any content that you post.</em></p>\n\n<p>We are making this change in preparation for the aforementioned API, which we hope will increase Letterboxd’s utility by allowing other apps (yes! read on) and websites to make use of and interact with Letterboxd and its content. In order to do this, we need to have the right to use and replicate any content you’ve posted historically and any content you post in the future. Any content of yours that is accessed via the API will carry with it a strict requirement that you be attributed and linked as its author, wherever it is published. More on this in due course.</p>\n\n<p>We also want to make clear that you can only post original content on Letterboxd. Copying other people’s reviews (no matter where they come from), in whole or in part, is not okay.</p>\n\n<p>Up till now we’ve dealt with spam and plagiarism complaints under the more general content-related clauses in our terms, but we feel being clear on these individual matters is important, hence the above changes.</p>\n\n<p>The next official use of our API will be via a native iOS app, which we’re hard at work on. More about this as we get closer to completion!</p>"

Films had to be feature-length and have had at least a limited theatrical run in the US during 2014. Popular films that only screened at festivals weren’t eligible, but will no doubt show up next year. We ignored the release window rule in the “Ones to Watch” section, which notes the up-and-comers from the festival circuit—and we’re very proud to see fellow Kiwi James Napier Robertson’s superb film <a href=\"http://boxd.it/8pTU\"><em>The Dark Horse</em></a> at the top of that list.</p>\n\n<p>The results were calculated as at 1 January, and may well change as the year wears on (last year’s highest-rated film <em>12 Years A Slave</em> no longer holds that position, as you can see <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/crew/list/2013-highest-rated-films/by/rating/\">here</a>). We’ve compiled official lists for each of the major categories, available under the <code><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/crew/tag/yir2014/lists/\">yir2014</a></code> tag.</p>\n\n<h2>In memoriam</h2>\n\n<p>The deaths last year of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Williams we felt deserved special mention, so we’ve included video tributes to those actors from Caleb Slain and Tony Zhou respectively. We were greatly saddened by the passing of a number of other industry names during the year, including Sir Richard Attenborough, Lauren Bacall, James Garner, Bob Hoskins, Mickey Rooney, Harold Ramis, Shirley Temple Black and Saul Zaentz.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll leave the rest of the review content for you to discover—use the up/down arrow keys on your keyboard (if you have one) to zoom through the pages one by one.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/2014/\">The 2014 Letterboxd Year in Review</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>We have lots more on the way in 2015, more about that very soon!</p>"

      "sub_title": "Our approach",
      "abstract": "",
      "body": "\n\n<p>As we did last year, we made some choices regarding which films were eligible in each category. Documentaries have their own category and don’t also appear in the top-rated list, which we restricted to narrative films only. Animated films were included in the top-rated list but not in other genres, and foreign-language films were included in all genres.</p>\n\n<p>Where possible, we’ve included films that had a US theatrical release (limited or otherwise) in 2013—plus the last week of 2012, as noted below—except for the ‘Ones to Watch’ category, which collects the highest-rated 2013 releases (including at festivals) that were watched by only a small number of members.</p>\n\n<p>Drama and comedy proved too difficult to accurately categorize, but you can see what featured highly in these genres, based on our TMDb tags, in the <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/popular/genre/drama/year/2013/\">Films</a> browser. There’s a number of ways to slice and dice our film listings in that section, if you haven’t taken a look there yet.</p>\n\n<p>We stuck to feature-length films in all categories, which meant the exclusion of all short films, as well as the 400-minute documentary <a href=\"http://boxd.it/6BuS\"><em>Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>For ‘Most Divisive’ we used a minimum threshold of the number of views, to highlight the year’s more popular films that divided audiences. The ‘Most Loved to Hate’ category is based on the number of low ratings that were also accompanied by a ‘like’ from the same member.</p>\n\n<p>And in the acting and directing categories, we only included appearances in 2013 releases (plus <em>Django</em>) which is a change from last year, but will give more varied results year on year (with apologies to <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/actor/samuel-l-jackson/\">Sam Jackson</a>, who would likely win it every year otherwise).</p>\n\n<h2>The Django situation</h2>\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"http://boxd.it/2cCk\"><em>Django Unchained</em></a> is officially a 2012 release, but we included it because its Boxing Day US theatrical release meant it didn’t make it into last year’s review (published December 23rd), and it didn’t feel right to exclude it outright. Besides which, the film cast a long shadow over the first half of the year, holding a top-five spot from January through May, as you’ll see in the month-by-month popularity charts.</p>\n\n<h2>Thanks to our Patrons</h2>\n\n<p>Many thanks to our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/patrons/\">Patrons</a>, who have been previewing the page over the past week and provided plenty of useful feedback.</p>\n\n<p>We won’t spoil the results, so head over to <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/2013/\">letterboxd.com/2013/</a> and enjoy! If you have a keyboard, your up/down arrow keys will work to skip to each screen. And members, make sure you’re signed in first if you want to take advantage of the poster menus to add films to your Watchlist and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>If you just can’t get enough, we’ve published <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/crew/tag/yir2013/lists/\">extended lists</a> for the major categories. Go crazy. Tell your friends. Throw out a tweet. Happy new year!</p>"

You’ll see we’ve amended the year in review option on your profile page to show all years in which you’ve made at least ten diary entries. These pages no longer require manual publication either, they’re updated automatically whenever you perform relevant actions on the site.</p>\n\n<p>Reminder: a <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/pro/\">1-year Pro or Patron membership</a> is required to get your personalized year in review, and this is enabled for all years as long as your membership remains active.</p>\n\n<h2>Tag auto-completion</h2>\n\n<!--figure[1]--><p>When making diary entries and lists, the tag field now auto-completes from all previous tags you’ve used. On devices with a keyboard, you can press Tab to auto-complete the suggested match, or use the cursor keys to navigate to another suggestion. To create a new tag without auto-completing, press Return. And tags can now be removed by clicking them in the editing interface.</p>\n\n<h2>A better watchlist</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve made some additions to everyone’s Watchlists: genre and decade filtering is now supported, and around the site you can now hide films that are in your Watchlist, in addition to hiding unreleased and short films, or those you have (or haven’t) watched.</p>\n\n<p>And by popular request, Pro and Patron members can now import to their watchlist using the same formats we support for import elsewhere in the site. Read more about our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/about/importing/\">import format</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Other improvements</h2>\n\n<p>A few other items of note:</p>\n\n<ul><li>The ‘I’ve seen this film before’ option when saving a diary entry is now smart, and will select itself if you have prior entries for the same film (yes, finally).</li>\n<li>If you make a diary entry without a review, but have previously reviewed the same film, we include the text of your prior review and a link (or just a link if the review contains spoilers).</li>\n<li>Diary entries now appear in your profile’s RSS feed.</li>\n</ul><h2>One more thing…</h2>\n\n<p>Oh, we nearly forgot. We’ve always sorted films by a popularity metric derived from the amount of activity for each film. In effect, a measure of quantity, not quality. From today, we’ve added the ability to sort relevant sections by highest or lowest rating! For example…</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/by/rating/\">Letterboxd’s Highest Rated Films of All Time</a><br/>\nBy genre: <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/genre/science-fiction/by/rating/\">Science Fiction</a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/genre/horror/by/rating/\">Horror</a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/genre/documentary/by/rating/\">Documentary</a>, et al.<br/>\nBy decade: <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/decade/2010s/by/rating/\">2010s</a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/decade/2000s/by/rating/\">2000s</a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/decade/1990s/by/rating/\">1990s</a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/decade/1980s/by/rating/\">1980s</a>, et al.<br/>\nOr how about: <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/decade/1970s/genre/comedy/by/rating-lowest/\">Worst Comedies of the 1970s</a>…</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, we use a weighted average calculation similar to the one <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votes\">employed by IMDb</a> and used in last year’s <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/2012/\">Year in Review</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re now starting to think about our 2013 year-end wrap up, and beyond.

This is very much an ongoing effort, and we’re by no means done on this count.</p>\n\n<p>Last week we also added a couple more options into the Visibility control (the ‘eye’ icon that appears beside the sort options on many pages): it’s now possible to filter out films you have (or have not) seen from said views, as well as to hide both short and unreleased films. We’ve retained (but renamed) the old behavior that faded posters for films you’ve watched, this is now available as ‘Fade Watched’. The new filters are smart, too: the ‘Hide Unreleased’ filter will automatically disable itself when you browse to the <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/upcoming/\">Upcoming Films</a> page. In addition, we’ve added the ‘Netflix Availability’ filter (available to <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/pro/\">Pro members</a>) into more pages, including in Lists!</p>\n\n<p>And we’re pleased to finally have clobbered the issue that caused certain parts of our mobile site to render incorrectly on some Android and iOS 7 devices.</p>\n\n<p>Stay tuned for a couple of nice features we’re readying for Pro and Patron members, more about those very soon.</p>"

      "body": "We made some changes last week in a number of areas. Here’s the goods on what’s new:</p>\n\n<p>Previously we supported viewing films by release year, genre and Netflix availability in somewhat of an ad-hoc manner, which often meant these filters weren’t offered together. We’ve remodelled the main Films section so that these filters (and more) can be applied together to narrow down your selections, and we’ve added more ways to sort the results.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of a Popular Films section, popularity is now just one of several ways to sort films. All visitors can filter the main <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/\">Films</a> section by decade, year or genre, and/or view only unreleased films based on US release date (or all films in our database at once, also not previously possible). Pro members can additionally throw Netflix availability into the mix. New sorting options (in addition to popularity) include by name and by release date. By combining a popularity search with the unreleased films filter, you can see the community’s <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/films/upcoming/\">most anticipated</a> films.</p>\n\n<p>You may also have noticed we changed the “Hide films I’ve watched” control to match how the others work; this will enable us to add more options here in future, rather than it being a binary setting.</p>\n\n<p>In your Diary and Watchlist, we now offer more sorting options as well: you can sort by activity date, earliest/latest release date, your highest/lowest rating, film name, popularity or running time (as appropriate in each area).</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, we’ve made other small changes and improvements:</p>\n\n<ul><li>The Settings section has had an overhaul, and we’ve added the capability to manually refresh your Twitter avatar if you’ve connected to that service.</li>\n<li>We added a shortcut in the poster menu to see what lists each film is included in.</li>\n<li>All site notifications can be dismissed manually.</li>\n<li>We’ve tightened up on which element attributes are permitted in HTML content (now it’s just <code>href</code>).</li>\n<li>We fixed a bug where rewatched films weren’t removed from your Watchlist.</li>\n<li>We fixed a bug where making a list private then public would cause it to re-appear as a recently published list.</li>\n</ul>"

We have a plain-English <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/legal/community-policy/\">Community Policy</a> which can be summed up in two words: “Be cool”.

We’ll be following it with the ability to block a member’s comments from appearing in any threads you choose to read. More on that soon.</p>\n\n<p>We have also added (finally!) the ability for members to edit and delete their own comments for a short while after posting, particularly to help with typos or badly formatted HTML. And we’ve made the following improvements:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Added the ability to remove ratings from the Diary page.</li>\n<li>Added a link between Director and Actor pages for the same person.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the Diary page would show inconsistent rating values between its table and modal (edit) views.</li>\n<li>Restored the creation of Activity for reviews that are added to older (existing) Diary entries.</li>\n<li>Removed the ability to comment on Diary entries that have no review (unless there’s an existing thread).</li>\n<li>Updated the way we post tweets (the previous method was unsupported by Twitter).</li>\n<li>Removed some third-party code that was causing problems on Android devices.</li>\n<li>Restored the ability to set Favorite Films from the mobile site.</li>\n<li>Worked around a Chrome issue that caused the List template to appear misaligned.</li>\n<li>Worked around an IE8 issue where the browser would ignore some of the site’s CSS.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where usernames containing only numerals had inaccessible profile pages.</li>\n</ul>"

For US$19 per year, Pro members gain access to new features (see below), improved Netflix integration and data importers, and unlimited use of the site; as well as the opportunity to support Letterboxd as we build the best community of film lovers on the web.</p>\n\n<p>We still love our free members. The site will continue to work for you just as before, with one exception: Netflix integration and data importers have both become Pro features. If you joined us during our beta period, your Netflix connection will continue to work.</p>\n\n<p>For our most die-hard fans, we’re also offering a Patron membership level, which will get you listed as a Letterboxd <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/patrons/\">Patron</a> and earn you a drink on us if you’re ever in the vicinity of HQ. We hope you join us by <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/pro/\">upgrading your account today</a>. If that’s not enough to entice you…</p>\n\n<h2>Your year in film</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/2012/\">2012 Year in Review</a>, you’ll be pleased to know all Pro members get their own personalized “2012 Year in Review” page like <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/matthew/year/2012/\">this one</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For members who’ve kept an accurate diary for some or all of 2012, this is a terrific way to present your year in film (and if you haven’t, get cracking!). The page can also be customized with up to six of your own lists. (We’re working on a “Year in Progress” page as well, more on that soon.)</p>\n\n<h2>New importer</h2>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/import/\">data import</a> facility now supports a simple CSV format <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/about/import/\">described here</a>. In addition to populating lists, you can use the new importer to populate your Films, Diary, Ratings and Reviews pages, by including the appropriate columns in your import file. If any enterprising devs make this work with user scripts for popular services (<a href=\"http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/32964\">for example</a>), let us know and we’ll share your handiwork.</p>\n\n<h2>Hmmm… upgrades</h2>\n\n<p>Today also brings some further changes for all members. Many of you have asked for a way to show your Diary for a particular time period, and from today, you can filter by year, month, day or week (the year filter is in the header, the others you’ll find linked from relevant content in the Diary and elsewhere).</p>\n\n<p>We’ve also added an option to filter your Diary (or Ratings page) by individual star rating, which will assist you in tracking down films you’ve logged but not rated. Check out those unicode URLs!</p>\n\n<p>Based on your feedback, the Review field in the Add a Film panel now expands when focused, for a better writing experience, and the ratings histogram for a film (or a member’s films) now displays all ten possible values, instead of grouping them in pairs.</p>\n\n<p>As always, get in touch if you have any feedback on these changes.</p>\n\n<p>PS. We hate captchas, but they’re a necessary evil, so we’ve made our own based on completing film quotes. You should probably sign out and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/register/\">take a look</a>.</p>"

To combat bias from films with smaller numbers of ratings, we used the same formula employed by IMDb for its Top 250 list, which weights films with fewer ratings slightly towards the mean rating for the site. To decide on a minimum number of required votes, we examined the frequency of ratings data and picked a cutoff that includes the top 20% of films rated by the community over the course of the year.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of notes on categories: documentaries are in their own category (so don’t appear in the Highest-Rated Films list). Elsewhere we’ve been a little more stringent in defining genres than the TMDb data allows, especially in the Horror category, which is applied quite liberally. And we’ve removed crossover films between genres too, so animated films don’t appear in sci-fi, for example. Lastly, the popular reviews summary is a selection from our most popular long-form reviews, with films and reviewers only allowed to appear in that section once each.</p>\n\n<p>A slight technical issue today means we’ve removed the poster menus from this page, but we’ll return them as soon as we can. If you want to add these films to your Watchlist, or otherwise interact with them, you can do so from the <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/crew/tag/2012/lists/\">accompanying lists</a> we’ve created for each category.</p>\n\n<p>A huge thank you from all of us at HQ for the life that you bring to the site every day. We are truly in awe of this community and it continues to delight and amuse us. Have a Merry Christmas, watch some films, and we’ll see you in the new year.

      "body": "<p>Until recently, Polish-born <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mwichary/\">Marcin Wichary</a> could be found at Google, where he spent time in several of the company’s key product groups, and assisted in the creation of many of its best-loved interactive <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/\">Google doodles</a>. Next year he joins <a href=\"http://codeforamerica.org\">Code for America</a> as a fellow, a position that we trust won’t diminish his capacity for thoughtful, nuanced writing about trips to the cinema.</p>\n\n</p><p>In reply to one of his many helpful Letterboxd feedback emails, we snuck in a few questions for him.</p><p>\n\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwichary/4957997695/\"><!--figure[1]--></a><small style=\"font-size:0.9em;color:#89a;\"><em>Self-portrait by Marcin Wichary</em></small></p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What were your early cinema-going experiences like? Was there a seminal equivalent of <em>The Goonies</em> in Poland?</strong><br/>\nOne of my cousins was crazy tall for his age, and he managed to sneak us all into a theatre to watch an uncensored version of <em>Superglina</em>. I was eleven then, and I couldn’t sleep that night, deadly terrified of a bipedal enforcement droid from the movie standing in a doorway behind me, ready to blow me to pieces whenever I moved.</p>\n\n</p><p><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/robocop/\"><!--figure[2]--></a><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-terminator/\"><!--figure[3]--></a></p><p>\n\n</p><p>So, yeah, of course I am talking about <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/robocop/\"><em>RoboCop</em></a>. The tickets were pricey and the theatres far away, so movie-going was reserved for big, impressive productions. All these came from Hollywood, although with baffling, <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_16990_lost-in-translation-20-baffling-foreign-movie-posters.html\">bespoke posters</a>, and equally creative new titles (<em>Superglina</em> means “supercop”, <em>The Terminator</em> was an “electronic assassin”, and <em>Die Hard</em> would translate back to “glass trap”, which of course caused problems with the sequels).</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>You seem to have an affinity for 80s films in general, judging by their representation in your <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mwichary/lists/\">lists</a>.</strong><br/>\nI’m fascinated with computer and technology history—particularly the 80s, which is when the general public was introduced to home computers and robots. And while I will forever applaud <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/wargames/\"><em>WarGames</em></a> for its realism, the romantic scene with Virginia Madsen playing cello against the computer from <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/electric-dreams/\"><em>Electric Dreams</em></a>, or the most annoying robot ever from <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/deadly-friend/\"><em>Deadly Friend</em></a>, can tell you just as much about public perception, fears, and hopes involved with new technologies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I read that you’re a fan of Stanisław Lem. Do you prefer <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/solaris/\">Tarkovsky’s adaptation</a> of <em>Solaris</em> or <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/solaris-2002/\">Soderbergh’s</a>?</strong><br/>\nI have yet to finish the apathetic former, and I couldn’t get past the latter rewriting so much. But if you’re in love with the source, you can’t really win, can you? The book has a chapter with the protagonist sitting in a doggone library, leafing through academic papers. How on Earth, futuristic or contemporary, can you film <em>that</em>?</p>\n\n</p><p>Actually, about a year ago, I teamed up with an illustrator to work on a <a href=\"http://www.aresluna.org/stories/lem-doodle-interview/\">Stanisław Lem Google doodle</a>, which was essentially a five-minute interactive animated movie. It took us forever, and required a lot of really tough decisions I did not expect. If anything, that gave me a lot of respect towards people who squeeze visual narratives out of words for a living.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>You’ve famously <a href=\"http://www.aresluna.org/stories/toy-company-my-ass/\">sought out</a> the landmark building from your favorite film. Do you only stalk inanimate objects?</strong><br/>\nAs a teenager I <a href=\"http://www.aresluna.org/stories/memoirs-of-a-train-traveller/\">visited Lem</a> himself once, in his house in Cracow. It was foolish, but arguably rather necessary for my continued well-being. But one of my favorite moments was actually an anti-stalk. A few years back, I was visiting my friend at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (which, if you love movies, is more fun than visiting Hollywood itself). And, in the company store, he starts elbowing me and pointing towards the entrance. Turns out, who else is there, but not George Lucas himself?</p>\n\n</p><p>My first thoughts on what to do were exclusively restraining order-inviting, but then I realized this was Lucas’s place of work, and I shouldn’t really behave like a common fanboy. So, I just looked at him, and made one very slow, respectful nod. After a second, he did the same. It was pretty legendary. People are still talking about it.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>What film is your guiltiest pleasure?</strong><br/>\nTwo-dimensional worlds are easy to love. I can not only watch <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/rocky-iv/\"><em>Rocky IV</em></a> on repeat, but there is no way for me to get through the ‘No Easy Way Out’ <a href=\"http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPb7g_BlXQ\">montage</a> without rewinding it a few times.</p>\n\n</p><p>I mean, hypothetically.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Christopher Livingston <a href=\"http://www.screencuisine.net/screencuisine/television/movies-ill-always-watch-if-theyre-on/\">wrote recently</a> about the films he’d always watch if he coincided with them on TV. What would make your list?</strong><br/>\nI suppose all of those movies I don’t remember watching the first time. Or second. The movies that were just always <em>there</em>. Both parts of <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/die-hard\"><em>Die Hard</em></a>, which Polish TV was fond of playing every Christmas. Some of the <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/weinberg/list/police-academy/\">Police Academies</a> — cheap and horrible, but my Dad loved them. <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/tango-cash/\"><em>Tango &amp; Cash</em></a> (I rounded up different Polish translations <a href=\"http://www.aresluna.org/attached/misc/tangoandcash\">once</a> and in typical case of Internet serendipity, someone actually made a master’s thesis out of it later). <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-blues-brothers/\"><em>The Blues Brothers</em></a>, forever responsible for the Pavlovian humming of the Peter Gunn theme whenever I’m driving in Chicago. And <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/ghostbusters-ii/\"><em>Ghostbusters II</em></a>, on a grand-grand-grand-copy of a close-captioned VHS tape, which I learned a lot of English from, and I will argue to my death is far superior to the original.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spielberg or Scorsese?</strong><br/>\nMeh. Fincher! It was actually through Letterboxd that I realized he must be my favorite director, since I watched all, and liked most of his movies. The making ofs and interviews, the attention to detail, the certain relentlessness toward movie-making he exhibits is very inspiring.</p>\n\n</p><p>I also have a soft spot for mainstream action directors. Michael Bay, Michael Mann, the late Tony Scott—I don’t actually like very many of their movies, but I admire their body of work and where they’re trying to go with it. On my business card while at Google, my title said “the Michael Bay of doodles”, which was half-hopeful, half-cautionary.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite Letterboxd review you wish you’d written?</strong><br/>\nI’m going to pick Morgan Nichol’s <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/themorgan/film/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol/\">review of <em>Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol</em></a> because it’s unpretentious, clever, funny, incisive, and meandering in all the right proportions.</p>\n\n</p><p>Come to think of it, kind of how I like my movies.</p><p>\n\n</p>"

      "body": "<p>Somewhere in Scotland—often with the curtains drawn—lives our most prolific member, at least in terms of his tally of films watched. You won’t find much of an online presence for <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lordcookie/\">Adam Cook</a> outside Letterboxd, but within the site his depth of knowledge, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lordcookie/list/help-whats-the-name-of-that-film/\">generosity</a> and authoritative writing style are all on show. We asked Adam a few questions for the first in a series of red-carpet interviews with the people who make Letterboxd great…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our average user has recorded about 180 films, and you’re close to 10,000 — do you sleep at all?</strong><br/>\nI’ve had terrible sleep patterns for years which has undoubtedly helped me watch thousands of films whilst most normal people are curled up asleep in their beds. Yet erratic sleep is a price worth paying if it means I get to do what I love and watch new movies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Melville’s <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/le-samourai/\"><em>Le Samouraï</em></a> is clearly an important film for you. It’s your Letterboxd avatar and one of your four favorites, and yet you haven’t reviewed it. Can you talk about what makes it special?</strong><br/><a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/le-samourai/\"><!--figure[1]--></a>\nNow that is a tough one to answer without going into great detail but I’ll try. On paper, it is a fairly standard hitman story that we’ve all seen countless times before. However, the big difference between this film and every other hitman movie is that the execution is flawless. Jean-Pierre Melville has made many classics throughout his career, and trying to pick a favorite does a disservice to the others, yet every element of this film is so perfect that it is hard to really look beyond it.</p>\n\n</p><p>Alain Delon is one of cinema’s coolest actors and this is arguably his most iconic role. He was more than just a clothes horse though, he was also a great actor and you totally buy into the spiraling desperation he feels as his managed and controlled world comes crashing in on his carefully constructed life. Visually the film is a joy to behold, from the slow, lingering cigarette smoke that wafts through the sparse bedroom at the start of the film to the icy-cool nightclub interior; it is the sort of film you could pause at any moment and admire its beauty. Whilst the story isn’t all that original, it is still expertly told as Melville meticulously ratchets up the tension. It is one of those rare films that never puts a foot wrong and for my money it is the finest French film ever made.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>You’ll have to wait for a proper review when/if the film gets a Blu-ray release though.</p><p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you spend time when not watching films?</strong><br/>\nWhat, other than spending it on Letterboxd you mean? As sad as it might sound, an awful lot of my free time is spent watching or reading about films but I do enjoy music, writing and long walks on the beach. This answer has just turned into a profile for a dating website, sorry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cinema or home theatre?</strong><br/>\nIf it is a good theatre then the cinema wins every time. Sure, they can be expensive these days but there is nothing quite like the communal experience and being enveloped by the large screen and seat-shaking surround sound. Sadly I don’t get to go to the cinema as often as I once did, but I doubt a home theatre experience will ever truly compete (not unless you have a small fortune to spend on the equipment).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aliens or zombies?</strong><br/>\nIf you’d asked me this question when I was 15, the answer would have been zombies, but these days the undead have become overexposed with an endless stream of forgettable films. Therefore I guess I’ll go with aliens by default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And finally, do you have a favorite review you wish you’d written?</strong><br/>\nThere are many great reviews from talented writers on Letterboxd (as my own <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lordcookie/list/your-favourite-reviews-on-letterboxd/\">list</a> proves) but I am probably most envious of Lise’s <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lise/film/the-thin-red-line/\"><em>The Thin Red Line</em> review</a>.</p>\n\n</p>"

      "body": "Since launching our private beta almost a year ago, our most-requested feature (by quite some margin) has been a better mobile experience. Today we’re pleased to announce the first step: a mobile-optimized view of Letterboxd for visitors on handheld devices.</p>\n\n<p>In today’s release, we’ve added optimized templates for most of the site’s key pages, with more to follow. Our approach was to provide as much of the content from the desktop site as made sense in a mobile context, and to streamline the experience by tucking away navigation elements, and by removing a few of the time-saving shortcuts and popups that add enormous value to the desktop site, but tend to slow down a focused mobile workflow.</p>\n\n<p>While we would love to have built a 100% responsive site, this proved something of a challenge within our existing web application framework. Instead, we’ve built a responsive mobile site, which loads automatically on all devices 640 pixels wide or less (you can manually switch between desktop and mobile views in the footer). A key benefit of this approach is that it affords us more control over which elements we include on each page—instead of including a sidebar element and then hiding it in the mobile view, we can subtly alter the markup or omit the element entirely.</p>\n\n<p>We’d like to underscore that this is a first cut. There are areas we plan to further improve as time allows, and a few of the site’s more complex pages, such as the list-editing screen, have not been optimized (but are still accessible as they were).</p>\n\n<p>This release also addresses a few other nagging issues: your user menu now has a direct link to your Diary; rating a film immediately updates the status of the watched flag in the interface (this previously required a page refresh); lists that have notes on one or more films are now highlighted as such; and list editing is improved in Safari.</p>\n\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback on these new additions through the regular channels, and will work to further improve Letterboxd based on your input. Happy viewing!</p>"

With Marc Webb’s <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/film/the-amazing-spider-man/\"><em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em></a> rounding out the top four, this became the week the superheroes took over the asylum.</p>\n\n</p><p>The highly-anticipated conclusion to Nolan’s Batman trilogy has divided audiences and drawn criticism even from those who loved his second instalment. The Letterboxd community has been generally positive in its feedback, with an overwhelming majority of the 2,250 ratings for the film so far being four stars or higher.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>At the positive end of the spectrum, Mr DuLac <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mr_dulac/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">praised</a> the inclusion of elements from classic Batman comics, calling the film “surprisingly character-driven”, Travis Lytle <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/chavrosbaby/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">described</a> it as “tense, emotional and gripping … full-bore, grand-scale entertainment”, and Chris Davis <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/chrisdavis90/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">loved</a> the director’s “clear and innovative vision”. Mark Kinsella neatly <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/markkinsella/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">summarises</a> the general sentiment:</p><p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t reach the anarchic heights or the thought-provoking themes of <em>The Dark Knight</em> and at times it seems to be struggling with too much plot, but <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is an exciting and emotionally fueled denouement to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.</p><p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</p><p>Further down the rating scale, various reviewers criticised the film for its <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/keithtalent/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">“bland and derivative”</a> set pieces, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/ross/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">poor staging</a>, <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/baronronan/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">misplaced character motivations</a> and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/grantyb/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">lazy exposition</a>.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>Marcin Wichary’s three-star <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mwichary/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">review</a> begins with a fantastic relationship analogy and goes on to deliver a typically thorough dissection of the film’s flaws and general <em>weirdness</em>. Marcin saw the film as part of a back-to-back screening of the complete trilogy; his reviews of parts <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mwichary/film/batman-begins/\">one</a> (★★★★) and <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/mwichary/film/the-dark-knight/\">two</a> (★★★★½) are also worthy of your time.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>At the lower end of the scale, Adam Cook found <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/lordcookie/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">little to like</a>, and while Ryan’s 4,500-word <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/followtheblind/film/the-dark-knight-rises/\">excoriation</a> of the film made some stout points, it ultimately failed to move much beyond the implausible nature of the plot, to which Dean Sherriff had the best <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/followtheblind/film/the-dark-knight-rises/#comment-71933\">response</a>:</p><p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  </p><p>Mate, it’s a movie about a billionaire philanthropist who, after training with a secret society of ninjas, decides to dress up as a bat and fight criminals one at a time using only his wits, fists and a utility belt. … It’s a FANTASY film and liberties of logic have to be allowed.</p><p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</p><p>We’ve loved watching the reactions to this film unfold on the site, the good, the bad and the downright ugly. Keep them coming!</p><p>\n\n</p>"

      "body": "Today we’re pleased to announced our transition from private to public beta. All pages on <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com\">Letterboxd</a> are now publicly visible (except for those deemed private by their owners), and all new users are able to send invitations to friends immediately following sign up. Letterboxd will remain invitation-only for a period, to enable us to control our rate of growth.</p>\n\n<p>In the six months since launching at <a href=\"http://brooklynbeta.org\">Brooklyn Beta</a>, we’ve attracted more than 17,000 beta testers, who have collectively written some 80,000 reviews, compiled close to 10,000 lists and added over 2 million films to their online diaries.</p>\n\n<p>The amount and quality of feedback received during the private beta period has been overwhelming. Our users have proven to be engaged, lucid and passionate about film, which we love. Most of all, they love spending time on the site—the top third of users spends over ten minutes every time they visit, and this is reflected in the number of pages we’ve served to account holders: over a million per month in March and April.</p>\n\n<p>The private beta period also gave us an opportunity to refine our service, and to add new features: a new diary view, the People page, popularity sorting options, an incoming activity stream, importing of ratings and lists from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com\">IMDb</a> and <a href=\"http://www.delicious-monster.com\">Delicious Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\">Netflix</a> integration (import viewing history, add to instant queue and filter watchlist by Netflix availablility), and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> friend finders. Today we’ve added another useful toggle that allows you to temporarily hide films you’ve seen (while browsing poster grid views), and introduced a small amount of display advertising (let us know if you have something to share with our users).</p>\n\n<p>The public beta period will be used to further grow the Letterboxd community, to improve our mobile experience and to deliver a public API for third-party interaction. Now that we’re live to the public, we’d love you to share your profiles, reviews and lists (or any other page) across your existing networks.</p>\n\n<p>Happy watching.</p>"
